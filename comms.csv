1|Npower have tested my patience.... And I'm losing! No bill for months on end, incorrect and duplicated bills then received. Opened a complaint/disputed and although they acknowledged that they had messed up (repeatedly), they couldn't put the situation right and put a default on my credit report! The staff are useless and often slate npower themselves. I've switched supplier (e-on, who are much better), but npower are still threatening legal action on an account that is closed and satisfied (which they acknowledge). They are incompetent ameatures-don't put yourself through the experience! 
2|I was with N Power at my previous address, when we left the property we had outstanding debt with N power, we was unaware of this money that was owed, they contacted a debt collector and they got in contact with us, at this stage I contacted N power to find out what was owed etc - I had an agreement with them to pay the money monthly, they told me that they would contact the debt collector and let them know we had come to an agreement, however they never told them and then I had the debt collector at my front door! demanding money, I had to call them again and was told they would tell them, however we have since received further letters from this debt company, I will never go with N power again their communication skills are disgusting!!!!!!!
3|I moved out of my house august 2014 and thought i had settled both electricity and gas in october when after hassling them they finally produced a bill. Thought it was all settled but it turns out they had not settled the gas. They omitted to mention that. Why on earth i would settle one and not the other is beyond me.In January!!  i got a bill for GBP40 (interestingly it was dated may 2011)   i was way working for the first three months so got back to messages from a debt collection agency which was the first i heard about itJust spoke to npower who would only reduce it by GBP25 instead of wiping as any normal company would have done after being 5 months late with a bill  - just paid it but will put this story on as many websites as possible so people understand how incompetent and inept this company is. Avoid them at all costs.
4|"moved into a new house in June 2014, up until today I still haven't received a bill. it has been problem after problem, firstly the opening reads given to them by British Gas, they couldnt get right and apply to the account correctly, took them 6 months to get the account correct and the serial numbers for the meters confirmed with thier ""bak office team""!!I was expecting a bill in december in line with their direct debit 6 month billing cycle, but could see online, bill wasn't going to be generated until April 7th 2015, rang to be told that there was a problem with the account and there was nothing they could do!?Bearing in mind, this account was a brand new account, with a new house, with opening reads given to them, bi-weekly meter readings sent to them by myself, and yet they still couldnt generate a bill.7th April came, SMS received to say there was a problem with the account (surprise surprise) and they would fix asap. log in to online account to see next bill is due 1st July!?!?!?!?!Rang to find out why this was, billing department rang their complaints department who fixed something on the account which was apparently minor. Cue the complaints department swapping the elec and gas readings round, screwing my bill and the past 10/11 months of meter reads gone! Only found they had made the mistake of swapping the reads round when I asked why I owed them GBP225, after working out I owed approx GBP600, account in credit by GBP850!!Rang back after getting cut off, to be told by billing that it would be 10 days to investigate (their) mistake on the account, after speaking to the web team and speaking to a very helpful person, readings have been rectified today and bill should be generated 3-5 days.After all this, this is no way to, A) run a business and more importantly, B) treat your customers.There's no excuse for the ineptness on N-Power's behalf and all the apologies in the world cannot make up for being left in the dark, not knowing whether you've over/underpaid your bill. bearing in mind these show up on your credit scoring, its extremely important they don't mess anything up.The GBP50 exit fee per fuel is looking extremely attractive as I'm not sure I can hack another 2 years with N-Power.Avoid like the plague!!!"
5|"Mr Beamer Wong,A guy phoned me up and it was an young male Asian voice and so I thought this is going to be fun.  He wanted to sell me gas and Electricity.Having been in Northern Ireland for the last 10 years I know all too well Energy suppliers here are about as rare as an honest politician.  So I spelt out loudly; Beamer:""Am I right in understanding that N-Power supplies to Northern Ireland.He replied by simply and ignorantly saying Sales Boy:""yes I understand this is an Island, it is my headache to supply energy to you!""(LOL good luck with that.)So he proceeded to ask me of my meter readings which I obligingly gave to him, but stopped short at the bank details.  He demanded to get my bank details before he even found out whether N-Power had a tap in the supplies here.  I am not a racist but I was trying to let the poor man down easily.  I couldn't get energy off N-Power even if I wanted to because we are not on the mainland.  But these sales guys just don't get a clear message.  As thick as the fly head butting the window."
6|I have had nothing but trouble with N Power they illegally doubled my direct debit from GBP44 to GBP96 a month even though I was GBP500 in credit. They promised last November to give me this GBP500 Back. Ive Left NPOWER THEY OWE ME GBP290 CAN I GET IT BACK NO WAY I am spending hours on the phone and chat to be just given more LYES LYES LYES THIS COMPANY IS GERMAN AND SHOULD BE KIKED OUT OF THE UK THEY ARE JUST CONNING US
7|Switched over to them recently based on price but I wish I had read the reviews first. It has simply been problem after problem with meter readings and the online account. I have had to make several calls, none of which have been less than 30 minutes wait and when you talk to the staff they are either confused about their own systems or downright rude. While I write this I am on hold now after being pushed from department to department and it is now 1hr 23 minutes on this call and still no resolution. I did get GBP30 compensation for some of the problems but in all honesty, I regret getting involved with NPower.
8|"This is a cut and paste of the complaint email (not the first that I sent to NPower) regarding my terrible experience to date: I am writing to you concerning an outstanding credit which has been owed to me since the account was finalised and closed on the 23rd November 2014. This figure amounts to a total of GBP100.13 as stated on my final bill. Having not heard anything from NPower and without having any sign of this amount being settled via a cheque or by transfer into my account by the middle of January 2015 (the 19th of January if my memory serves) I called to query this and to ensure that the amount was correct. There was some confusion during the conversation with a call- centre operator who I can only describe as being fiercely loyal to your company. Hats off to him for the courage of his conviction however I cannot help but feel that his die hard loyalty is misplaced given I have found business dealings with you nothing more than unreliable and extremely testing of my patience during long and drawn out phone calls. After being transferred to a supervisor I was finally able to raise the issue I had tried to request at the beginning of my first conversation (albeit after a substantial amount of talk time being consumed) only to be told that this would take a further forty days to remedy. On the 20th of January 2015 I received a letter from the complaints manager for NPower. Given its generic wording and non-specific nature I presume that this was generated by a computer as a method of temporary appeasement and to give the impression that something was actually being done. I was reliably informed in this letter that an advisor within the complaints team ""will ensure it is resolved and keep you informed of progress"". So here we are on the 24th March 2015, four months after I stopped being a customer of NPower. On that date your company no longer had any claim to the GBP100.13 credit. It is now nine weeks after I called to ensure the amount was correct and for payment to be expedited. Still I have not heard from your undoubtedly overstretched complaints advisor's and there is no sign of the money owed. I concede NPower is a significantly sized energy providing company, in fact one of the ""Big six"", however the simple rules of business should apply. If I were owed an amount from an individual once services were ceased or at the conclusion of a contract I would afford them a second request in writing giving twenty eight days notice for payment to be made. After this period I would be well within my rights to seek legal advice to receive monies owed. How is it that as an individual requesting money from a large concern these principles are clearly ignored. I should be within my rights to demand interest on top of the outstanding amount to allow for monies lost had it been in my account. I am certain that if I owed NPower a sum of money once the contract was terminated, long before now I would have received letters from a debt collection agency. The amount owed is not large, however your very large company has been unable to quickly and efficiently resolve its payment. It could be said that if NPower cannot be trusted with smaller amounts and relatively uncomplicated issues, as in this case, how can it be expected to manage larger sums and national energy supply. I would go as far as to state that NPower clearly has flawed procedures and inadequate management strategies to operate in the ""Big six"" arena and this is clearly evidenced when any attempt by members of the public is made to ask questions or clarify detail regarding an account. I lost count of the number of times I was told that someone was unable to provide an answer there and then, or unable to read your own billing system to work an answer out themselves. I cannot help but feel that many of your operators are mere automatons providing scripted responses in the hope that the customer accepts this and is willing to wait forty days for an answer to a simple question. I have no doubt that this email will be read possibly with contempt, maybe even passed to a colleague to roll their eyes at. That aside a copy of this email will be placed on price comparison and review sites in the hope that it may at least prevent one other person from making the monumental mistake of trusting NPower with their money"
9|In September 2014 I was notified that our direct debit would increase to GBP156 per month. We have duel fuel with them. Looking at the bills we were always GBP300-400 in credit at the end of January each year.  I rang them and asked why they are increasing my DD when we are always in credit through the winter (we go to Tenerife). They took no notice and the upper DD went into play.  In February I rang them to say I was not well in credit (Over GBP300 and asked for my money to be put back in my bank.  I was promised this would be done in 2-3 working days - we provided up to date meter readings.  This did not happen so I informed them I was coming off DD and going onto paper billing, and requested my money back again.  I then received a per credit bill of GBP315.32.  I again asked for this to be deposited in my bank.  I have just had a bill, GBP159.14 as they have taken the invoice amount from the credit.I am sick of them and moving as soon as this account is clear.  They are absolutely useless.  They do not communicate with each other let alone their customers. Total rip off merchants.  I am now going to complain to the ombudsmen - they are using customer credit (of which there must be millions) to finance their company.  Avoid them at all costs and if you are with them keep away from Direct Debits.
10|"The only good thing about npower is the free phone number. If I had to pay for all the calls its taken to make some sence of my account I would have been in the bankruptcy court by now. Not a happy bunny. Looking for a newprovider but dont want to go ""out of the fry pan into the fire"".Whatever happened to the good old Gas Board and the Electricity Board?"
11|"NPower told me that I had built up nearly a GBP5,000 worth of Bills over a year and started taking GBP735 a Month in Direct Debits to pay it off (I argued that it couldn't have been correct and they ""proved"" to me that it was. 6 Months later I get a Bill reversal and a new Bill - for GBP3,000 less. I asked for a refund to which they told me that a BACS refund would take 28 Days - I don't know how they work that out as they are same day. I never received my refund and in the end my Bank re-reimbursed me under the Direct Debit Guarantee. No apology, no interest for the time they had stolen my money.You shouldn't touch them with a Barge Pole."
12|Having sold my property four months ago I have finally got the 300 pounds I was owed from n power I had to escalate this to a complaint to get this result staff have always been polite but despite promises from numerous staff and endless hours on the phone repeating myself it has taken a disgustingly amount of time I'm pretty confident if I had owed this company money they would not have been so lenient with me 
13|Despite setting up online account to enable me to send meter readings for my 95 year old father was informed on entering account that it was closed. Rang customer service and guess what they refused to speak to me even though I had previously sent up the account so I could operate it. I asked to speak to manager etc. but to no avail. I found the person I spoke to very rude and didn't seem to have any interest at all in helping.

15|"For the fourth time in one week, I had to contact Npower regarding a none working pre-payment meter and four times they sent out some of their trained chimps from their subsidiary company called Meterplus.  Today they say are refusing to come round for... wait for it, and you will love this, ""human faeces in the hallway"", to say I was taken aback is the understatement of the year, anyway, after spending most of the day on the phone to these idiots, I have been informed that although this allegation has been made, no one is prepared to put a name to the accusation and no one will come and fix the meter.  Incidentally, I have checked and rechecked the hallway and no, there isn't anything of the sort there, so, join them at your own risk, ... you have been warned "
16|Have tried 4 times over several months to set up Direct Debit.   Spent a long time on the phone each time and each time a different amount was suggested, but nothing actually happened till the fourth time, when one DD was taken from my bank account.   Almost immediately after that I was sent a separate large bill to pay within a couple of weeks.   I have been trying to log into my account to see if I can work out what is going on, was told my login was not recognised though it was definitely OK), but I could contact Customer Services on online form.  Wrote a message and tried to send that, it wouldn't allow me to because the account number was not recognised.   But it was definitely OK and actually popped up as I started typing it!   I have had a lot of other problems with Npower, including not receiving a bill for about a year, and not having an important form returned to me.   I intend to switch to another company.
17|i have been with this joke of a supposed , business since moving in to my home seven years ago. I pay about GBP45 for gas and electricity which i think, because i.m away alot and very frugal, is fair. I am perplexed as how they cant get bills to me on time but am always around GBP200 in credit. I had just recieved a statement from them in November saying my bill would go down to GBP35 as i dont use much, however on New Years eve i recieved a demand for over GBP1000 and my payments to go up to GBP160 month.I was beyond livid. i spoke to a manager who,get this, said they had been reading my electricity meter wrong for 4 years and I hAD TEN DAYS TO PAY. WELL I CANCELLED MY NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS as i was so upset. I want to humiliate this  poor company and am preparing to fight all the way.N.B.  I also recieved a bill mid december saying my monthly bill had not been paid ,i phoned and they said oh yes it had been paid, Well today i recieved another more threatning letter saying i hadnt paid this bill again. You couldnt be this inepet if you planned it. Joke Power. C Lippeatt
18|Plumbing contractor about to condemn my gas connection as npower haven't been out for over three months after reporting time and again an issue with the meter
19|8 page bill, each with a different amount.25 minutes to get through on phone to be told all the 8 page bill is wrong and I owe a different amount.Usual read-it-off-the-prompt-sheet-because-your-customers-are-too-thick-to-doubt-us response of its a system error.  What total rubbish.Alert- your customers are no longer this gullible. You rank up there with the banks in terms of total lack of trust and credibility.
20|Npower is the most appalling company for dealing with its customers. Npower are extremely unhelpful and have diabolical people skills.  I sent a complaint letter three times without any response whilst receiving threatening letters requesting the outstanding balance. My complaint requested a break down of electricity usage because the figures on the invoices I recieved  were incorrect. They continued to send a statement of charges. I eventually (after a year) received a phone call stating I recieved a break down of charges but they still did not give a break down of energy usage. They stated I owe the balance but did not tell me why, I was told I needed to pay because they were right and that was that. I would advise never to use this company, they do not look after their customers and do not know how to respond to complaints, Avoid like the plague.
21|Since joining NPower I have had nothing but trouble. When I joined I didn't get  bill for about 9 months then when I did get a bill I got 3 at once. After I came to the end of my fixed term I contacted them to see about going on a new fixed term tariff. I had all my bills together and had my usage over the past 12 month. When speaking to the woman on the phone she had all different numbers on her computer and was saying my bill needed to be doubled to cover how much I was using. I then had another bill and because I was in credit after just going through the Summer they wanted o reduce my bill, which I didn't want as I would use more over the Winter period. I contacted them again to tell them to keep my direct debit the same they said I was only had electricity set up and they had to re set up my gas eventhough I was on a dual tariff. After all the problems I have had I have now switched to a new provider, hopefully I will have better luck this time. I would NEVER g back to NPower or would I recommend them to anyone. 
22|What a terrible company, I used this company for 2 years, all direct debit. Decided to move away to another company, i have over GBP200 credit after 2 months of closing their account, they are asking my name, meter readings, again and again. I told them account is closed refund the credit, they ask my address? I do not thonk they know what they are doing, I SENT 4 emails, avoid this company awfull!!
23|Once the account has started they decide to increase the direct debit to more than necessary then when you terminate the contract refuse to pay back the extra money you've paid. They also refuse to respond to complaints & the current Ofgem reporting system requires their response before you can refer the complaint to Ofgem.
24|After switching electric account to n.power I noticed they had wrong house number, rang them and was told it was sorted. sometime later I get a bill for wrong address and note they have also taken a payment , rang again and was told again it would be sorted and a refund made. What a load of idiots as it didn't happen. eventually after many letters and trying to phone them sometimes a wait of about 40 mins only to be told they couldn't deal with me as it wasn't my address !!!! I tried their executive complaints team who promised compensation within 6 weeks .... never heard another word. Then a bailiff is dispatched to my home and to make things worse I had a plumber working there at the time who promptly asked for cash payment and left what an embarrassment. The bailiff rang n power on a special number having looked at my bills etc and finally they did a land registry search which what a surprise confirmed I had nothing to do with it and never had. this by now has been a year and I had involved the ombudsman. Many weeks later the executive complaints man rang to try and sort it and offered a paltry GBP150  which went to GBP250 when I said no, he also confirmed a cheque was sent out to refund incorrect payment but amazingly it had been sent to wrong address.  I told him it was a ---- poor company and an insult to offer that low after all the time and stress I had gone through. I now await the ombudsman to contact me n power reckon I will get less that way but its a principal so will take my chance. What a shower they couldnt run a bath let alone a company and the customer service is non existant 
25|Over the last 3 years I have seen everything from frustration and anger on My Wife's face to coming home and finding her in tears and needing to visit her Doctor.NPower are the cause of the issues we have had but finally I have found the solution SWITCH.Having received no bill for nearly a year we went from a family who was never in debt to a family owing NPower over GBP1000.00 due to their incompetence.Since the money owed was down to them we went onto a pre-pay metre and with hard work and many hours overtime I have paid the debt back and never once received an apology from NPower.I have now switched to the same company who supply my Gas as they speak in plain English. I now have pre pay metres for both my Gas and Electric supply some will say this is a little more expensive but I now know where I stand and never again will I receive a bill for my energy.    
26|While I really appreciate your prompt reliable and dedicated service I have one compliant against your service. I have paid 49.99 vide order no 1934221 dated 06.02.2014 .I was informed that the instrument is blocked by the carrier and the amount was kept under trade credit. I have received a mail on 12.08.2014 that an unlock is available and was billed for 99.99 . The offer says that at the time of final pAyment the system will automatically adjust the available trade credit and I was advised to pay the balance . I was charged for the full amount of 99.99 wide order no 2307984 dated 28.08.2014 without adjusting the available trade credit. I have brought this to your notice immediately . When I go through the unlock message I observed that the first amount of 49.99 is appearing as refunded. I would like to know when the amount was refunded and the mode of refund . In spite of my best efforts to know the position I am unable to get any clarification from you .please advise me the details . I will be highly thankful to you for the same.an early response is awaited I once agai repeat that your service was excellent reliable and fast. Prasad 
27|They need a lesson in treating people with respect. they are trying to take GBP91.10 when was on a pay as you go meter for my electric. i refused to pay and they threatened me with court. finally got through to a decent person who has frozen my account for investigation. she said i will still have to pay if they got it wrong!!!!!!! i told them im not paying anything. they must think we are idiots to try and rip us off like this, thank the lord im with a great company now. i advise anyone having problems with npower to change to utilita they are brilliant and super cheap.
28|I would like to tell you every problem I have had with this company. I can`t they have sucked all my energy out of me(no pun intended).They are incompetent, clueless and useless. Do not touch them.I repeat do not touch. Sorry i`m away to lie down,even writing about has brought back to many bad memories.Incase i`m not clear enough do not touch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.Only good news i have had over GBP100 in comp.
29|Words fail me ! I just can't believe that a company can be so INCOMPETANT and still be allowed to get away with it!I've been with them 10 months, they took over a neighbours supply instead of mine, owe me GBP650 and still haven't got even my address correctly. Customer service is a joke and their complaints team are beyond even that.I'm moving back to SSE at least I didn't have any problem with them.
30|Have received a bill for GBP43.92 on a 'pay as you go' meter account. Obvious mistake, so I call them and explained that I have been billed incorrectly. After a few months and a reminder letter from them they acknowledge their error and that I do not owe them money - I asked for this in writing. All they sent me was another reminder asking for the GBP43.92 - in response to this I made a formal complaint  to which I have not received a reply. They then sent me a further reminder letter dated the 8th August 2014 and received on the 18th August (via TNT) advising that unless I pay or contact them within 7 days they may pass my details to their debt recovery team. I assume this has been done already given the time taken to receive the letter and the deadline imposed by them!Mistakes are annoying, but when they have had numerous opportunities to put things right and don't you can only assume that a core part of their business is harassing people to get money that they have no right over.If you are daft or unfortunate enough to use them, you will need to keep contact details for the ombudsman handy, or accept that your credit rating will take a nose dive as I am sure that mine will do. Or, perhaps just pay them money for nothing.  I would rather be dead in a ditch than pay them GBP43.92 that I don't owe....
31|I have been an npower customer for several years and their customer services are very poor, I am presently searching for a decent energy supplier if such a thing exists ! If you are thinking of joining npower I would advise you strongly don,t !
32|My deceased father used Npower and unfortunately I also had to continue to use them briefly. I spent months trying to explain that sending letters to him would not be effective. I paid all I thought I needed to pay, and had checked this upon leaving the property he lived in. I then was notified months later that I had mail at the address for my father. I discovered that the mail was in fact numerous letters from Phillips and Cohen associates (UK)ltd,  these letters demanded monies that there had been no bills sent for. I complained and thought the situation had been dealt with and had a reasonable resolution. Then months later I was again notified that there were letters for the executor of my deceased father. These letters were more debt letters from the same company. I complained once again, really angry and distressed and Npower confirmed that I had paid and that no one had told the debt collectors..this is continued evidence of the shambles that is Npower and the poor and shoddy company who cause stress and upset to customers time and time again. Awful.
33|"Billed GBP90 per month for energy (after they said they could save us money if we changed from British Gas). Did not inform us of any debt on the account, but we ended up running up a debt of GBP800 in a matter of 2 - 3 months! They insist that we pay it all upfront, ""no room for negotiations"" from the customer service team. Other issues include wait times on hold for 1-2 hours at a time, they never call back when they say they will, and they have no concept of what they are doing to people! We have passed everything over to the Ombudsman and they are still seeking to get an attachment of earnings to pay off the debt that we do not owe! When we asked for all of our paper work to be sent through they charged us GBP10, and also sent us random private and confidential information belonging to other customers! Utterly shocking, how they still operate is beyond me! Also, it has been noted from all of their letters that they literally make stuff up, there are massive inconsistencies between what is said on the phone (when you can get through) and what is actual fact!  "
34|I have been a nPower company for 9 years and can say in all that time they have been consistent.  Unfortunately it has been consistently terrible.  They have overcharged me and when I complained, I had to chase relentlessly to get the money that they had overcharged back.  I had to row with one of the Advisors who couldn't understand why I would want in excess of GBP450 that they had incorrectly billed me back and not to leave it in my account.Despite providing accurate and correct meter readings, they have recorded my meter as the wrong type and when I complained, they again took nearly a year to resolve it.  I have since cancelled my service in April and they have still yet to provide the handover information to my new supplier, effectively trapping me with them.Their complaints team seem to hope that the Stockholm Syndrome will eventually kick in and I will grow to love them.  I cannot say this clearly enough, don't go with nPower, they are truly awful and not to be trusted.
35|NP over estimated my monthly billls and I have now accumulated approx GBP400.The has contactedthem twice and still not received it.This is MY money N Power not yours. Send it back!
36|I have never had any problems with a provider but NPOWER! They are rude and not helpful I was sent a letter to say I was behind on payments, I thought I was in front.I left NPOWER as they wanted to charge me GBP350 per month for a E&G; what a joke so I said I would to leave they owed me money and then when I left I got a bill in the post to say I owed them GBP333.18 which I believed to be incorrect!!! What a joke I was so angry that they felt they could do this to me. Fair enough I set up a plan to pay them back knowing I have other provide to pay for. GBP333.18 over 12 months is about GBP27 per week  I paid GBP33 one month and GBP25 the following month I then received letters that I was 18.64 behind I don't how they calculate their bills but its all wrong! I ask to know the name of the Customer agent I spoke to that set up the account and I was told they can not tell me as its data protection are they serious? NPOWER is a joke and I was finally sick of them I ended up sticking the balance on my credit card just so I don't have to call them or deal with them anymore.STAY AWAY FROM NPOWER THEY ARE ROBBING FUDGES!!! NEVER AGAIN! 
37|took me 1 hour and 13 minutes to actually talk to someone after hanging on the phone and then they can't do the simply thing like refunding my credit when the website states that they automatically refund if there is GBP60 credit for each utility, there is in fact over twice that amount, not happy at all customer service is atrocious and has got worse over the last two years just wish I could find another supplier with half decent reviews which I am unfortunately having trouble finding
38|"I moved to NPower 12 months ago. I have not had a bill since then. I complained 9 months ago. I am still waiting for a bill and a reply. Today they gave me a courtesy call telling me that my complaint remained their ""top priority!""To top it off I was told that if I moved supplier they would demand full payment of the ""debt."" What debt?  I want them to tell me if I owe them anything. Fed up and stressed."
39|I have been an NPower customer for too long - they have overcharged me by GBP1600, taken unauthorised direct debits of over GBP400 out of my account without warning, costing me hundreds in bank charges. When I call their 40p/min customer line, wait times are always over an hour. When I finally get through to someone, the phone goes dead. I have written a dozen letters of complaint, all of which have been ignored. I reported them to ombudsman, they ignored the resolution they agreed with Ofgem, they prevented me from taking my business to another energy supplier. They have five times more complaints than any other energy supplier. They make GBP90,000 profit everyday, mainly from tricking customers. Wholesale gas and electric prices have been falling for three years, yet they post record profits and pay no UK tax!! I would advise anyone considering giving NPower their custom to take a bunch of ten pound notes and set fire to them, because you clearly don't value money at all. These people will take money from you and ignore you when you try to stop them. The government should shut them down.
40|Npower have stolen from me. Ignored 15 letters of complaint over a nine month period. ombudsman made them agree to say sorry, compensate me and allow me to move suppliers. they ignored this and objected to change of suppliers - they've forced me to remain their customer! This is a violation of trading standards.. Called Npower and waited 70 minutes (Yes, 70 MINUTES!) on hold, finally promised a call back which never came!. DO NOT USE NPOWER: their call centres are critically understaffed, they will take money from you, ignore complaints and play games to prevent you from taking your custom elsewhere. This is a company that makes GBP90,000 PROFIT PER HOUR and has been fined milions for bad customer service!!! and pays NO CORPORATION TAX in UK!!!! NPOWER DO NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS, USUAL CALL WAITING TIMES ARE BETWEEN 25 mins and 2 HOURS!!! I gave them 1/10 because you can't give zero or negative rating!
41|I transferred from SSE TO NPower; seduced by fixed rates to 2017; November 2013. On initial readings, did not use readings I took as instructed by them.   Am still waiting to pay first full bill, June 2014. I had to contact them for some action, they had a dispute with SSE but did not bother to keep me in the loop.  Sent complaint, acknowledged receipt, still no response.  As a company I had heard bad reviews, now first hand I know they are totally incompetent.  I'm going back to SSE, NEVER HAD A PROBLEM IN TEN YEARS WITH THEM.
42|How can they get it SO wrong? I tried to switch to NPower in Nov 2012 and by March 2013 they had made such a disasterous job of the switchover that I decided to return to my previous supplier. NPower made it so difficult that they EVENTUALLY reduced my final bill by GBP50 when I threatened them with  the ombudsman. So I paid my final bill and got on with life, until yesterday, 14 MONTHS LATER, I got a final demand for GBP184.22.I have spent all of yesterday and all this morning fighting with them. Despite the cheque having come out of my account they wanted me to send them a statement to prove it. I refused as it is their problem, so they threatened me that it would effect my credit rating!!.Threats of The ombudsman made them FIND the payment. They are a sad joke,time wasters.Don't even consider going over to them and if you are with them PLEASE keep ALL your paperwork. You WILL need it.....
43|I switched from npower to another supplier on 26 November 2013 due to absolutely appalling customer service . A period of 20 months went by without receiving a bill despite my numerous requests. My emails were never answered was often impossible to contact them by phone and when I did manage to contact them I was repeatedly lied to by various disinterested plebs , laughingly called customer service advisors. I received a total of 3 final bills which were all totally wrong ,eventually I finally received an accurate final bill dated 31March 2014 showing a credit balance of GBP408.81.I have repeatedly asked for my money to be refunded and each time have been told by various plebs that this would take 7-10 days, it's the fourth time I have been told this. I now have no option but to instruct my solicitor to initiate legal proceedings. DO NOT TOUCH THIS COMPANY.
44|Well what a mess!! I spent the best part of a year trying to pay N Power for my electricity. My account was in credit by almost GBP2,000 - however this was balance out by the fact I owed them GBP1,900 for electricity. Could the reconcile the two - no. Apparently there was a block on the account and they were unable to marry the credit account from the monthly payments with the meter readings. However eventually all sorted - then I moved home. Gave them all the readings and as the account was once again in credit was given a refund of GBP63.50. No problem - until 9 months later I was presented with a bill for GBP56.00! Rand and queried - immediately offered and discount of GBP22.00. Explained this was not the point - why was I being charged a further GBP56.00 9 months after closing the account and moving house. They did say they would get back to me - still waiting 1 month later. Watch this space.
45|Avoid at any cost! Even if they offer the best value choose second best. I've been their customer for 3 years. I subscribed to meter reminder notifications and received it once. A bug, they couldn't find for the remaining 2 years and 9 months, precluded me from getting reminders. After missing submission my predicted bill was out of this world and it took another 3 months to get it right again. Then they lost my gas account details. This took them nearly a year to fix during which I wasn't able to access my bills or submit my meter readings. And then after I moved and chosen another provider it took them 6 months (!) to figure out how much money they owed me... and they sent me a check to the address I've left half a year earlier. In 3 words: bugs, incompetence and plain stupidity.
46|I don't know why people be hating, cos theyr're great.ok
47|Operate my account online.Went to pay my bill in March 2014, their systems were down/acting up - I tried over 3 weeks to pay, it wouldn't let me ... I tried again and again.Contacted them, they said pay by phone - an automated operation - I did this.Now I get a debt collection letter threatening bailiffs!! But I've paid!! The Bank says I have paid.I will take them to court if they ruin my credit rating and for the stress and worry of all this ... they have awoken a lion.Utterly, utterly, utterly, useless ...... horror show!
48|Unable to receive bill takes them over 1 hour to answer phone useless don't even deserve 1 star
49|We took out a boiler care policy and after nearly two months my heating developed a fault. An engineer called and diagnosed a leak in the system which was under the floor but did not investigate any further. Npower then contacted us to say THEY had diagnosed or as a pre existing condition and refused to repair it. Considering they had not seen the fault how they could diagnose it as pre existing I have no idea after being passed about various departments, The clause they used was that they had not completed their initial inspection which the contract said would normally be completed within 30 days (but may take longer). At my last contact I was told as they were not regulated by any ombudsman I could take it no further! At least they returned or premiums but have now lost an energy customer also. Avoid like the plague. Dishonest, disreputable and with some of the worst communication and customer service I have ever encountered. 
50|still waiting for a refund which has been promised since last December. I have been consistently told a pack of lies concerning when this would happen and am now taking legal action to recover my money and compensation . 
51|Npower took an incorrect electricity meter reading back in September 2013 which meant I had used an impossible amount of electricity for my home! After a phone call  or two my monthly payment was reduced back to the original payment. Then the problems really started......... I swapped to EDF so the incorrect meter reading became an issue. After many phone calls to npower, some of which I waited for almost an hour before speaking to someone and three separate complaint reference numbers I still had to contact the ombudsman. Npower held my credit of GBP86+ until February of this year, and I still think I am owed more but have accepted this amount.  I wonder how many more customers have had a similar problem and npower have walked away with our money. This week I've received a letter apologising that my complaint is still outstanding and they say I can now go to the ombudsman.  The individuals I spoke to were most helpful but the system is absolute rubbish. This is the price we pay for privatisation!!!!
52|Why is nobody doing anything about the incompetence of these liars! they could not be more incompetent if they tries and were getting paid for it. Last year was in credit by GBP67 and requested this be returned to me, due to staff incompetence, not being able to get through on the phone and being cut off on several occasions I eventually received this 3 months later!! stupidly I gave them the benefit of the doubt but not this time. received meter reading bill last Thurs and I'm GBP267 in credit. I called to request this be refunded to my bank account as I pay by direct debit. the lovely gentleman I spoke to said, yes that will take three working days to credit your account. low and behold no payment by Wed; phoned explaining every day since being promised a fast track payment and phone call back from a manager. Yes, you guessed, no phone call and no money! Stay away people. If I could have given 0 stars I would.
53|ive been with n power for a number of years the company has gone from bad to worse,they continualy put up your monthly payment when you call the  untrained operator agrees with everything you say and says it will be corrected, but never is eventually the ony way i could get any sense from them was to involve the onbudsman, and if anyone is having the same problem involve the onbudsmam get your problem sorted then leave for another surplier, they dont deserve your custom or your money money
54|I received my nPower bill today. My total electricity costs for Jan - mid-March were GBP250 inc. standing charge and VAT or about GBP100 per month during the winter.They have put my DD up from GBP47 to GBP167 based on an estimated average usage (including the summer months) of over GBP150 per month.There is no logic to this!! Obviously the average over both winter and summer months will be significantly lower than the winter months alone. This can only be considered a way of having interest free loans from their customers - what a RIP OFF.And to cap it off, the wait time to speak with a Customer Service agent was over an hour - hardly Customer Service.
55|I switched to Npower for gas and electricity supply since November 2013 and I am so regret now since they cannot even setup a direct debit. I feel that they deliberately do this because they want to charge me more money! I have called them so many times, every time they told me there is an error in their system and nothing wrong with bank account. As you can see this is their error but their customer service keeps sending me emails saying my bank rejected their direct debit requests and I have to pay standard rate rather than discount rate which was required with direct debit. I called my bank who told me there is no history that Npower has requested the direct debit setup on my account! What's a different between a rogue trader and this shameless company?
56|I moved into a 2 bedroom flat 18 months ago and set up direct debit to pay monthly. monthly payments were set at GBP30 then jumped without any warning to GBP227 after 4 months. tried to reason with them to get some form of continuity/consistency and was told I would have to wait for 12 months usage get an average.18 months later i have bought a house and hey presto am in credit to the tune of GBP430+didn't really want a 0% saving scheme with npower but thats what i got..and to answer the nice lady today who asked me if i wanted to stay with power in my new property - no thanks!
57|Been with them 19 years, 2 years ago bills stopped. tried to get them to bill as massive debts building up. Finally got a bill,we owe more than GBP1100 even after I asked them to increase our direct debits 6 months ago, because I was worried.hours spent on the phone, and no choice or chance to move to a cheaper supplier for 2 years, no bill, no move.They are the worst company ever
58|We have been with Npower many times and the most recent time when moving home. customer services are good local people but prices are far too high and standing charges disgusting they always employ staff think this is why prices are so high.few years ago we had threats even a visit to cut supply off it was a system issue error i phoned a few times but never got sorted until the last time. I would avoid at all costs glad to leave npower and Do Not Give Phone Number they hassle you when you leave.
59|They give a lack lustre service and it would be cheaper to find a decent gas engineer locally rather than pay GBP20 or so a month. 
60|Held outstanding money for a year, I discovered it by chance, they decided to send a cheque rather than credit my account, sent it to the wrong address.Cancelled my direct debit when I changed tariffs without telling me, fortunately I discovered and set it back upCancelled my direct debit AGAIN at the end of last year when I changed tariff, and switched me to quarterly bills.  This time I didn't notice as it was around Christmas and I was preoccupied.  Sent me a huge quarterly bill.  I paid 2/3 of it and updated my meter readings, told them I would pay the remainder the following month with the new bill, all accepted.  Then received a call from a collection agency!  No call, no letter no nothing.  This is how they treat someone who CAN pay their bill.  Paid the large bill in full and called to complain.  Got fobbed off and then transferred then hung up on!Just checked and it looks like they are also over charging me, put in my meter readings for the year and on my current tariff I should be paying about GBP920 a year, I was paying GBP77 a month (which is about right) currently they want GBP130 a month, the last bill was GBP388 for 3 months...  
61|First they closed my account without me knowing then sent me letter threatening to take me to court so I tried to access my account online only to find out they had closed my account so I rang them and they said they though I had moved.... yes they were serious!! So I set up a new direct debt and everything was sorted well a few days later the same thing happen I got a letter saying I owned them thousands and they were going to take me to court so I rang them again. I wish I had known what a pain they were! Please do not go with them. 
62|Worst company ever to trade in the UK. They take money that does not belong to them and charge you for twice the amount of energy that you use. If you try to set up a direct debit they will not bother then send you a threatening letter because you have not paid them. The only way this company would be value for money is if they were free!!
63|Dual Fuel. When someone says they will do something, and then don't I call that lying. When someone takes your money without permission, against your instructions, and then does not give it back to you after many months I call that being a thief. When someone sends you multiple letters stating all sorts of incorrect information and does not attempt to correct it I call that incompetent.They owe me several hundred pounds, they took direct debits after I had left them (having asked me to keep the account open while they settled it) and I already had a lot of built up credit. And they are almost impossible to contact. I have tried to reach them by phone many times, and only succeeded twice. They have insufficient staff to manage the tirade of complaints that come their way. I finally mailed a formal complaint to them some weeks ago and got a generic letter saying they are dealing with it. But when? The facts are simple. I closed the account in October. They owe me TWO stolen direct debits and a massive refund of credit. They are rogues of the highest order and should not be allowed to trade. I have had dodgy builders that deserve more respect than this lot. PahhhhhhH!
64|At last got shot of these excuses for a company. still had a surprise for me. I had enough when two years running at the same time of year (before Christmas) i did not receive a bill and had to call them re read the meter (despite it being read by someone i pay to do that job).  yet my final bill is sent leving me less than a week to pay it & worse when i do pay it adviused it will take up to five working days.Then get a reminder this company could not organise a party in a brewery and much much worse they treat bill payers not as customers but as cash cows. If this company is a example of a German company runs things then we have notheing to worry about. DO NOT TOUCH THEM WITH A BARGE POLE!
65|Worst provider in the UK I have ever dealt with.  Having been a customer with them for the previous 5 years, I switched to NPower from EDF when we bought a new house in November.  Despite providing opening reading to them in November, dozens of phone calls and e-mails and raising official complaint.  They still haven't updated my records or sent closing/opening readings to the previous supplier.  Haven't managed to speak to anyone who know their ass from their elbow.  Really frustrated!
66|They added a standing charge  50p per day to my gas account blaming OFGEM, I only use gas during winter so found this expensive. On talking to an Npower advisor was assured I would be given a credit and that they would introduce a tariff or discount for low users and to wait and see. As a fool I believed this 3 months later and GBP50 down. I was then informed I was misled and that It didn't matter if I switched I would still be charge the same as it was enforced by OFGEM. I contacted OFGEM WHO STATED THIS WAS LIES, OFGEM in a bid to reduce tariffs confusion have enforced a standing charge but this could be set at 0p per day and not 50p as led to believe by Npower. I have switched now to a company with a 0p standing charge, and 4 months after the change in supply I am still trying to close the account. After a letter stating they had cancelled the direct debit, they continued taking it. It took four weeks to get my refund and still it wasn't all of the money. I have spent over four hours of my time sorting this out. Don't expect them to call you back as promised, do expect to spend hours on the phone listening to hold music, and then being told the computer system is down. Switching to them was the bad decision.
67|Trying to get a refund out of them is like pulling teeth. They increase the direct debit amounts without agreement and build up huge credit balances which they try to hold on to. A refund is being considered only after I pointed that out to them, and once the amount was agreed I still have not managed to get the cash back and it has already been 6 weeks.
68|Swapped to npower last September, yet to receive a bill, impossible to contact, when you do get through staff are polite but full of false promises.I was not even informed of my date of the new contract until after it had taken place. Hours spent on the telephone trying to make contact. Letters written to complain with my fall contact details, but all you get is a letter with the lie that they have being trying to contact me and to contact them on the telephone ! I am still waiting for money owed from Scottish Power due to Npower. No good writing to OFGEM complaining of poor service as all they do as another powerless government watch dog is nothing and send you to somebody else.MY ADVICE IS STAY AWAY FROM NPOWER. its worth paying a little more to go somewhere else
69|Wrote in December 13 stating dual fuel rebate will be replaced by reduction on standing charge for both gas and elec. Will credit accounts by end of year (2013) with proportion of annual discount earned. Not done it, when phoned said - surprise surprise letters were worded wrong wont recieve credit until July 2014. Also asked why they had not passed on the reduction in green levies - as reduced by government - said as i did not have price rise (fixed tariff) would only get GBP12 in autumn 2014, 10 months after reduction by government. Greedy cheating lying horrible company to be ripped off by.
70|I had a letter regarding a complaint I had against them, stating they had tried to contact me without success, so could I ring them !! I know they had not tried to contact me, and have now proved this with a copy of my mobile phone records, which shows no calls made to me at the times they state. This is Company Policy with N Power to not ring you and then say they have. I have accused them of being liars and they have not tried to defend themselves. Do not be caught by this despicable trick. I am now reporting them to the Regulatory Body as I waited 28 minutes on hold before I spoke to them, something I should not have had to do. It is important to move your business away from them and put them out of business
71|Had first bill under 50 second bill came 200 pound for 1 bedroom flat 3 months witch should have been 100 max had to ring up twice to sort it out and still have to pay the overpriced bill from there mistake first call I made the person I spoke to was sarcastic and unhelpful so had to ring up again witch aint cheap of mobiles but was helped then but still got this nasty bill  
72|I tried to switch to Npower in Jan 2013I am in credit with current suppliersNpower cannot take on new gas supplies in some cases.I have referred to ombudsman and so far have GBP150 compensation offer but still no transfer after 11 months
73|I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 11 WEEKS TO SWITCH TO NPOWER, THEY ALWAYS GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO SPEED THINGS UP BUT NOTHING HAPPENS AND DUE TO THE DELAY I AM NOW PAYING INCREASED RATES WITH MY CURRENT SUPPLIER
74|tried to switch over due to competitive tariff and after 8 weeks still no head way or even any idea of why a delay. Past from department to department. false promises and clueless and unhelpful people who just don't care or seem interested. AVOID AVOID AVOID. I don't normally post reviews as I am reasonable and understand that people make mistakes but felt compelled due to the terrible customer service. Glad now i'm not a actual customer.
75|Tried to transfer over to npower as they appeared to have competitive pricing. An absolute nightmare of incompetence, terrible administration and abysmal communications too many to mention. One example: asked to supply start meter readings; tried to do so to find my account marked as 'Now Closed'. So called Customer Support totally unhelpful and washed their hands of the problem. So cancelled transfer. These people don't deserve to be in business at all, they have no concept of customer service and implement defective systems and processes. A total disgrace, don't touch them with a barge pole.
76|Changed from NPOWER to Swalec at the start of September.  They asked for meter readings early October.  Phoned Npower end of October asking why I had not had final bill.  After a 30 minute wait in the Q was told that they had not received the bills.  Told to phone if bill not received in 2 weeks.  Also phoned Swalec at that time who, whilst I was on hold phoned Npower who confirmed that they had received the bills.  Phone Npower who confirmed it with me and was told I would get my final bill by 3rd December.Not received today so phoned and guess what.  One of the dates on their billing system is out, so they could not raise the bill.  What about bl**dy telling me??  will now take up to 28 days to sort and get me the bill.What a bunch of absolute wasters.Just wish we had one electricity supplier and one gas supplier in state control.  Would save tens of BILLIONS on the cost of people having to swap every 1-2 years if you think of the cost to the company and cost to customers ... about 5 hours of my time so far I estimate.Bunch of incompetent MANAGERS ... not the front facing customer service staff!!!
77|"It took three months from the arrival of the first team of engineers to get a new boiler fitted and I had to postpone the fitting of a new kitchen. Their first efforts trashed my house, garden and drive and left the kitchen with pipes, wires, pumps, magnaclean, electrical boxes, etc., everywhere - it looked like part of an industrial complex. I had been assured that the finished product would easily fit into one of my new kitchen units. The boiler packed in during the first cold spell! I eventually got to speak to someone after numerous call-centre calls listening to music and being told ""your call is important to us"" whilst being kept on hold and paying a premium rate. Despite their ""free"", three-year, Npower guarantee,they intended to leave me with no heating or hot water for two weeks including Xmas. Fortunately, Glowworm, the boiler manufacturer, rescued the day.  Then, after their two ""free"" annual services, the boiler failed an inspection and could not be issued with a safety certificate.I have 8 pages of A4 listing phonecalls, emails, engineer and inspector visits and verbatum conversations which include no-end of broken promises and denials. Nobody at Npower has bothered to read any these.The only thing Npower did efficiently was to chase me for payment for a job that was incomplete. Within months of its installation they were hassling me with letters and unsolicited phone calls offering boiler-insurance contracts on a boiler that came with their free, three-year, guarantee and servicing deal. Every year they denied that I was entitled to these free services until I produced the contract.This company is little more than a call centre; everything else is subcontracted out to whoever will do the job cheapest. Their call centres are useless; their website crashes, or you end up in a loop where it continually tells you that you haven't completed a part of their form that you clearly have.Three years on, Npower gets 5 times as many complaints as their best competitor and is sacking 1,500 staff while outsourcing 500 jobs to India. It pays its chief executive a GBP3m ""performance related"" salary.The price we are paying for the privatisation of our utilities is expensive poor quality service from tax-dodging foreign-owned companies. Never mind, its all okay, they are going to send us all a letter of apology (03/12/13). This company is a joke but sadly the joke is on us!"
78|Billing problem started 2 months after i moved into property.They said d/d isn't set up so went through relevant checks and NO problems infact they had accessed my acount to take funds already so go figure? Since then continous emails from npower saying same thing,i have tried 100+ phone call attempts at trying to resolve matter & finally put a complaint in writting October.Made no difference at all,emails still arrive i even paid last month d/d using debit card and no evidence of the amount paid showing on my npower on line acount,thankfully though it is on my bank statement.....There's more as an irish fella used to say..... Today after sending more emails back at them and there complaints dept i thought i would try to phone them....Lord help me,i rang and after the usual blah blah blah we are experiencing high volumes i hung on..until after 22 mins the phone dropped out on their side,rang again and you guessed it same again,so after a cup of camamille tea i rang again and after 18 minutes so thats 22+22+18 mins try to stay with me i got a female member of staff who told me she would put me through to the EXECUTIVE complaints team..You know what's comming don't you? yep - i'll just put you on hold while i blah blah blah...8 mins later she she came back and told me to ring back as she couldn't get through and there was nothing more she could do! I think i could give Ban Ki Moon a run for his money now!
79|Agreed to switch to NPower more than 1 year ago. They have finally produced the first bill after months of me complaining. The bill is wrong! I could not recommend them as from my experience their customer service is very poor. 
80|I really cannot warn you away from using this company strongly enough. I am on a fixed rate tariff and by their own calculations my usage will be 10,800 units. I agree with that. That gives my annual bill of GBP460 and my account at this moment is GBP59 in credit. So you would think my monthly direct debit would be GBP35 but no they have increased my current GBP40 bill to GBP45 and refuse to alter this. So this time next year my account is likely to be GBP120 in credit ! If they do this to all customers how much are they making in interest of us 
81|Been with Npower for over 9 months now and they still havent opened my online account or sent me a paper bill. Yet they refuse to reduce my DD until they sort it out, despite account being nearly GBP500 in credit. Customer service is a shambles. If all works ok for you then go for it but if you have any billing problems...forget it. They're hopeless. Took me nearly 5 months just to get them to formally register my complaint on their system. 
82|"N-power is, totally without exception, the most incompetent, mismanaged company I have ever had the misfortune of doing business with.Their customer service is absolutely dreadful. Although the staff you initially talk to are, in general, polite and helpful, the same cannot be said for ""team leaders"" or ""section managers"".  They are arrogant, obnoxious, unapologetic, and down right condescending, should you have the audacity to demand to speak to one of them if you feel you are getting now-where with a ""customer advisor"". Not to mention the disgraceful amount of time you are expected to wait until you eventually get to speak to someone. No wonder they were fined GBP2 million for shocking customer service.[a fine we, as the customers, no doubt paid.] I moved home last November, having been a customer of Npower for several years. The ""moving process"" with Npower was one of the most stressful things I have ever had to deal with. Straightforward??? Anything but.  My account at my old address was closed down. It took countless phone calls to get a new account set up. Direct debits were calculated wrongly. Increased, then reduced. Then increased.  My on-line account was closed, bills went missing, passwords were not recognised, and it took numerous calls to technical departments to get this resolved. Then it took them almost 4 MONTHS to get my gas supply transferred over. Goodness knows why. I was never given a satisfactory explanation. N-power blaming Transco. Transco blaming Scottish Gas [ old suppliers at my new address.] Scottish Gas blaming N-power. Absolutely shambolic.Then. to cap it all, my mother had to move in to a care home in February due to deteriorating health. She was also, [unfortunately] with N-power.I lost count of the amount of times I phoned this lot to explain why my mothers account would need to be closed and terminated. I received countless letters asking why she was ""moving home"", send final readings, why was she leaving N-Power, would she like to have N-power supply her at her new home??All this despite me telling the incompetent buffoons she was very ill and was in care!! Then, as if this wasn't distressing enough for the family, N-power took EIGHT MONTHS to send out a final bill for usage up to the date my mother had to leave her home. And guess what else?  They applied an early termination fee as the account was terminated early.  UNBELIEVABLE OR WHAT. THEY KNEW THE CIRCUMSTANCES!!Now consider this......... After the recent increases announced, why is N-Powers increase up to SIXTY PER CENT MORE than their competitors??. EDF has announced an increase of 3.9%. Although that is a DIFFERENCE of 6%, overall that increase equates to N-Powers increase of 10.5% being 60% more. Explain please.Customers mean NOTHING to this company. You are treated with pure contempt.They are incompetent and greedy beyond belief. They are incapable of handling ANYTHING, and will go out of their way to make things as difficult as possible. Prices are now the most expensive of any supplier.[see above]Prepare a 3 course meal while you wait to have a phone call answered. Do not expect your complaint or issues to be resolved.My account expires in January. I will use ANY other company other than N-Power to supply my gas and electricity, even if they are more expensive.DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE N-POWER AS YOUR SUPPLIER.I repeat. DO NOT USE!!!!!!!!"
83|Impossible to communicate with them,  hours and hours spent on the phone and trying to use the online form.
84|I have spent from 2.10pm to 5.30pm today  either waiting  on the phone to be answered or not having my issues dealt with by incompetent idiots at this hopelessly inefficient company. They have paid me GBP100 and then GBP75 over the last year for wasting my time and failing me in every way possible. Privatised companies are more efficient we are told. As if!
85|"I don't think I've ever come across a more incompetent and unhelpful company in my entire life, and that is quite a long time. In the process of ""trying"" to switch to someone else and even that is made impossible by their hopeless and useless systems and totally unhelpful staff. I mean 2 months to send a final bill and still waiting. Ring up, wait ages on the phone, and palmed off with your new supplier is not agreeing the meter reading. Speak to the new supplier and of course they agreed the reading weeks ago. I want my GBP600 back which they hold and they won't give it too me. What a complete bunch of numpties. Totally recommended to avoid at all costs."
86|They built up my credit to the point that they held GBP700 in my money last year, and GBP600 this year. It took over a month to receive last year's amount after hours and hours of phone calls and emails. I'm still waiting for this year's money.... They don't respond to emails, and to reach a representative on the phone this often takes over 20 minutes and they are evasive.This company seems to hate their customers. Avoid.
87|I am a regular price hopper and normally the suppliers do an ok job....nPower on the other hand are clueless.....1. Call waits regularly more than 45 minutes.....and that is an honest statement.2. Bill calculation system is useless, my monthly direct debits have ranged from 7 pounds to 392 pounds....I have No idea how as my energy use has been largely the same for the past 8 years and all previous suppliers were able to set a sensible value.3. Because of the silly automated payment charges I am owed GBP820 due to overpayments....do you think I can get this back....so far no luck.4. The complaints department...and this the honest truth, close to new calls when they are too busy...it's true! I was stunned to hear that I could not be put thru to the complaints dept because they refuse calls when too busy!!!Avoid this supplier like the plague, don't go with them just for the sake of a perceived saving.....it's all a wheeze, as you'll spend the saving and more on the phone to them with some problem or other....you have been warned!
88|Switched to Glide a few months ago and NPower are continuing to send us bills and  reminders. Constant reminders to pay bills we have already paid, borderline harassment, yet complete inability to answer any calls we try to make to them to sort this out. We have been charged for not paying bills which we weren't even due to pay. Been trying to leave them for two months and it seems impossible. Everything about this company is poor, avoid them at all costs.
89|Stupidly I transferred to Npower and have discovered that not only are they totally incompetent, they are also illiterate as they are unable to reply to emails.They also appear to be incapable of producing a bill and no doubt when they do manage to, it will be wrong.
90|I should have read the reviews first before trying to switch. Customer service is horrendous. After 3 weeks they were  still unable to send the correct switch contract out?I spent almost 10 hours in total on the phone getting cut off several times.They are not professional and really don't deserve to be in existence.I've eventually had enough sleepless nights, and cancelled.They promised that they would remove my DD bank details from their systems, but I'm not confident in anything after the poor experiences over the last few weeks.Don't do it !! 
91|It has taken me 3 months to leave them as a gas/electric suppler, they cannot get my final bill correct, all this while holding on to the money they owe me and threatening me with debt collectors. Do use them! I have been with several other companies in the past with switching my tariffs and never had any problems before? After ringing them 3 times a week for three months I have still been given differing amounts for my bill and this is during the complaints procedure? They are now reviewing their recorded phone calls as they have lied so many time! They have offer me GBP25 to go away.
92|I switched to npower early this year for dual fuels but it took many months and several communications before the account was properly set up so I could see my bills and update meter readings on line.After moving house in September,I was told a final bill would take 7-10 days, then up to 30 days and, recently, an email apology for the delay but with no predicted timescale for the bill or the rebate I am due.This is basic accounting and, if an established major company cannot invoice and credit faster than this we are entitled to be suspicious of the cause.  I now see from internet forums that I am far from alone and that the problem is endemic.
93|I have just switched energy suppliers from COOP to NPOWER, The customer service is very poor to say the least. I have had to contact Npower three times because of wrong information being supplied . When you call the customer service to speak to someone the waiting time is a joke today twenty seven minutes waiting.
94|This company promises regular updates to internet accounts, but this is a lie.  We have no idea how much power we have used, or how much debt we may have incurred, and this has been the situation for six months.  They keep taking direct debits from our bank account, but the promised usage details never materialize.  Regular telephone calls and complaints to them have been ignored, and numerous false promises by their accounts staff continue unabated and unfulfilled.I can't wait to pack them in and go elsewhere, but suspect that they may all be the same; greedy and inefficient.
95|"I pay all my mums bills and handle all her affairs; she has dementia and lives in her own house with carers.  My name is on the n-power bill and I pay everything by direct debit through my bank account.  However, when I phone to ask a question about the supply, n-power insist that I go round my mums house, hand her the telephone and get her permission to speak to me about her tariff.  Waited 20 minutes on the phone to them to speak to someone, argued for 10 minutes that all I wanted was to check that we had the best tariff but stubbornly refused to talk to me.Tried to switch to First Utility - same attitude, like talking to a computer robot locked into a repetitive cycle saying cant talk to you the bill payer ""data protection act, data protection act..."", immune to common sense.In contrast - called Scottish Power, no problems - said they talk to the bill payer.  Now switched to Scottish Power. Hope Scotland doesn't vote for Independence, the average IQ of the UK will drop significantly."
96|I have never dealt with such a poor company. After 2 years I still do not know the tariff I've been on and now they won't even respond via executive complaints! I've been forced to raise a formal case with the ombudsman and this is ongoing. When I first moved to nPower they placed me on a higher tariff than the one I subscribed to, it took a year before they gave me online facilities and I could check to see what they had done! Then I complained and was serviced with multiple lies, false promises, ignorance, no bill for a further 12 months and in the end I had no choice to move because dealing with them is just impossible! The worst service and complaints team I've ever come across, hugely complicated retrospective billing I defy anyone to be able to reconcile and I would seriously advise anyone to steer well away from nPower at any cost! I would sincerely prefer to turn out my lights than deal with nPower ever again. My faith now rests with the ombudsman and a hope that they will bring nPower to account. Thinking of moving supplier ~ please! for your sake put this company at the bottom of the list. You cannot trust them, period!
97|we identified a problem that was their fault over the phone (i refused to pay because of this) and they still ended the call with 'we will still continue our collection procedure'! honestly, pay more for your energy even if npower are cheapest - otherwise it will cost you in the long run.
98|The worst utility company ever they do not give a dam and will not assist in any way, do not send any bills set up the wrong contract and tariff ignore every telephone call,email and letters. Do not follow any complaints procedure and then try to back bill at 4 times the contracted rate. Even sending recorded delivery letters to the head of customer complaints and the chief executive do not achieve anything. They make up fictions bills years ate then send in bailiffs the worst nightmare and they really do not care.
99|Switched to NPower for gas and electricity about 9 months ago and have never received a bill. Received an Email advising my bill was available online. There is no facility on my on-line account to view my bill. I contacted their customer services via the website and was told it would be a problem with my computer settings. My husband checked all this out and it was fine. After several more emails back and forth I put in a complaint. By the way, their automated response advises it will take 7 - 10 days to respond. At the beginning of September meter readings were requested, and I was advised it would take 10 days to generate a bill and another 3 days for it to become available online. Eventually I complained again giving NPower 7 days to respond or I would take my complaint to the energy Ombudsman. Today I received a letter telling me they were sorry I felt the need to involve a third party and that they had been trying to contact me, definitely not true. I called the no they gave in their letter and surprise surprise the waiting time on the line was 11 - 18 minutes, lucky it's a free no. Eventually after a long drawn out conversation I was told that there was a problem with their system and they are unable to generate a bill for me. They will speak to the relevant people but can't give me a time line of when the problem would be resolved. I am still considering taking this to the ombudsman.
100|Changed supplier - electricity and gas from npower in June 2013. They closed  electricity account immediatley  but three months later the gas account is still open.Have contacted npower on numerous occasions - they promise to sort it but it hasn't happened.  Excuses - not having the right info from new supplier. Info supplied by myself and new supplier. It was checked against the national database whilst on the phone to npower, yet they still haven't closed the account. Emailed and then made complaint - no response. Go online to look at account - a note on it that I am  to receive next bill in December. They havent supplied me since 1st JuneUseless customer services - full of excuses and lies. Would not recommend.Sainsburys Energy customer services very helpful and have even tried to help me.I'm making myself ill because I just don't know how to get it sorted
101|My saga with Npower crept up on me unexpectedly last August, and has continued to cause aggravation and distress ever since. It began with a cheerful sounding tariff called August Bill Saver 2013, which, ranking favourably price-wise on Uswitch, persuaded me to click in this direction, and saw me opt for this tariff in conjunction with duel fuel and direct debit. I wish I had known that that decision would still haunt me over a year down the line. I had just moved into a newly rented property, which was at the time signed up with EDF Energy for electricity and Npower for gas. Both were Standard tariffs, you know the sort, the expensive ones. I thought that in changing my supplier wholly to npower, on a Bill Saver tariff, this would save hassle and money. Of course, I was mistaken. Npower proceeded to put me on separate tariffs for gas and electricity, leaving the gas in the expensive Standard realm, and neglecting completely my direct debit request. So naturally, I got on the phone. I explained to them clearly the situation, and after being boomeranged around departments, and repeated explanations on my part, I was told that it would all be sorted, but it would take 14 days for the changes to show. I waited, and I waited, and I waited. After three weeks I called once more and with exactly the same result. Two months on nothing had changed. Frustrated by my incorrect billing I did not pay these bills, instead taking to the phone for a third time. Again, I explained the situation (again having to do this multiple times), adding this time round that I had been told my complaint should already have been resolved. I received a sorry, and a this time it will be sorted, but of course these changes take 14 days to show.The festive season arrived, but alas the joys of Christmas would be overshadowed by the writing of complaint letters. A month on from my last telephone call to npower, I had still not been put on the correct tariff. Friends now only needed to mention the name Npower to put me in a bad mood. I submitted my complaint online (with much hassle as it failed to recognise the electricity account number), and was sent an automated message saying that it would be dealt with. As you can probably guess by this point, it was not. January passed me by as I waited on a reply, and then, as February drew to a close, the true level of Npowers incompetence had become clear. They were incapable of resolving any issue through the telephone or online complaints avenues that they would suggest one use.My second complaint letter had a tone of disgust. I sent it to them by post and via their online complaints system, in the hope that even a company with the dire level of customer service that Npower possesses wouldnt miss this two-pronged attack. After a three week wait I finally received a reply. They were very sorry and my accounts were being corrected. Youll have to forgive me, but I was sceptical. Around the same time I received a call from my mum. An Npower bill had been sent to my parents address (despite repeatedly explaining to npower that correspondence should not be directed there as it is not where I live). This bill was a final warning  I was to pay or watch my credit rating slowly destroy. This news reached me during a bout of flu, so aching and exhausted I asked my mum if she perhaps could try to talk to Npower about the incorrect billing and explain to them why I had not paid. Of course though, it had to be the bill payer. I finally picked up the phone, and too weary to argue, with just the word of one woman that the electricity tariff would have been around that amount anyway, I paid the bill.Apparently contented with their sum of money, Npower proceeded not to contact me again. Come the start of April I made a phone call, again. I asked how resolving my complaint was going. I was told it was nearly there. Well, well done Npower, over six months since their initial mistake, and many many hours of phone calls on my part, plus a hug amount of stress and annoyance, they were nearly there.  Unwilling to waste any more breath on this occasion I waited until mid-May, having heard nothing on their part, to check up on them once more. How was it all coming on now? Had my bills finally been back-dated? Was I finally on the correct tariff? Oh yes, came the nonchalant reply, it was resolved a couple of weeks ago, shed send out a bill now that would be with me in about seven working days. Well, thanks for telling me. So, the apparently correct bill came, I paid it off. I asked about the direct debit discount I should have received had everything actually gone to plan, and was told that this would have only applied after the first year with them anyway  hmmm I thought. But, without the energy to challenge this, I hoped perhaps I could finally let a sleeping dog lie. However, they werent quite finished yet. Less than two months down the line, a letter came through the door. It told me that my Bill Saver tariff had expired, and that I would now be switched to a Standard tariff (the expensive one), and that I didnt need to do anything, as it would all be taken care of. Brilliant. After fighting for the best part of a year to be put on an economical tariff, I was going to, more or less, be taken straight off it again. Whether it was the correct decision not to immediately change energy suppliers, I severely doubt; but, not wanting the energy company situation to cloud my summer, I put it to the back of my mind.Now in September, over a year on from that doomed day when I chose an Npower tariff, Im looking to finally escape giving them any more of my money, ever again. So, I thought, Ill pay off my final bills and switch. For that Id simply need to log into my online account and Bobs your uncle right? Wrong, it isnt simple apparently. I cant log on. On some attempts it tells me there is a problem with my account, on others it says that the Mynpower system is down. Ive tried password and username reminders and resets, Ive tried making sure my account is registered, all to no avail. And what does their help section tell me to do? It tells me to log in to submit a query, which I cant, and the alternative is to give them a call. Well, you know what? I dont want to. There is not one little bit of my Npower experience that I wouldnt classify as a complete shambles. The company is clearly poorly organised, and Im quite sure that customer service must have been erased from any company values. And, whats worse, is if I dont pay these bills (which I cant access), when they want me to, it will be my credit rating thats in danger. I try not to think about how many hours of my last year Npower have wasted, and despite everything, continue to waste now. I was reluctant to pursue the terrible year Ive had with Npower further, as I thought itd be better to just forget about it. Yet, as I realise more and more the faults and follies in the way that their company is run, I cant help but wish to make my disgust known, lest it might help some other unsuspecting person from falling into the same disastrous trap.
102|I transfered to NPower in December 2012 after doing comparison and was going to save GBP200 a year. I was with Scottish Power paying GBP97 a month for Gas and Elec. The 1st D/D came out at only GBP44 which was of course incorrect. I did let it go for 3 months then rang to ask why so low. They said they had forgotton to charge Gas.!!! They said my account was to be reviewed in Aug so they would take correct DD then reassess my account in Aug. I was now paying GBP90 a month. I Aug (Still paying my D/D) They took GBP554 out of my bank without any communication. I phoned them and they told me to phone bank to get money back and to stop my DD till they had sorted the problem.They missed the next DD due to not being set up in time but told me I did owe them Over GBP450. I paid a one off payment and my DD went up to GBP120. There were numerous mistakes made over the next couple of weeks which were sorted by lots of phone calls. Then Beginning of Sept they took GBP215 out of my bank again without telling me. They said computer error. So I had to stop my DD AGAIN then they told me I needed to pay MORE on my DD. So I paid another one off payment. I checked my NPower account and they only set up my DD for GBP61..  (For Gas and Elec)  I want to cry. Rang them again and they changing back to GBP120.. SO MUCH FOR SAVING MONEY... They haven't got a clue what they are doing. Scared to change to someone else incase more mistakes...
103|Paid my npower bill last Friday. Today on checking my bank account see they have removed GBP600 out of my account, double what I paid last week wiht numerous card transactions - machine didn't go through!!!!Phoned customer services and was told to phone my bank to get them to stop the transaction, did so, only as it was a card payment and not DD not possible! Phoned npower back furious with the misleading information and demanded to know when my monies were going to be returned to me. There customer services are horrendous, I got a 'oh god not again' comment when I asked yet again when was I going to be getting my GBP600 paid back into my account. Pointed out to her that how about I remove the same amount from her account so she goes overdrawn and can see how it feels!I will be moving asap. I am disgusted by their service, they caused me to go overdrawn, gave me misleading information and basically couldn't careless that I might have to pay bank charges for 3-4 days until they put my money back in my account. Why should I move money from savings account to cover their double transactions that they claim they don't earn any interest on? News to me, as far as I'm aware all accounts no matter who with get interest on monies within them, but apparently not npower!I would not recommend them and will be writing letters a complaint to all with regards to their actions and lack of customer care and support
104|"Where's the ""Zero stars"" option?What can I say?  Emails that aren't answered, bumped-up direct debits, sitting on GBP500+ in the account, unintelligible tariffs, officious call-centre personnel (you might as well talk to the cat), repair calls cancelled without notice; the inability to provide anyone in Powys to sort out our endlessly out-of-phase Eco7 meter... I could go on, but I'm sure this and the other 200+ reviews slagging them off give you the picture....""Npower: sign up today and receive a cup of cold poison as our introductory gift!""...they might as well..."
105|I did a Uswitch from EON (who were excellent) 6 months ago.Npower STILL haven't set up my dual fuel account fully. I haven't a clue how much I'm spending.I've emailed many times with no replies, phoned the complaints dept' countless times and now have the Ombudsmen taking over.This is the final time I'm switching - ignore Martin Lewis, usually do it yearly but it only saves a few pounds and simply isn't worth the hassle.All the 'FIX NOW' prompts are one big rip off by the greedy energy companies to charge us more for fixed tariffs.I plan to go back to EON.
106|I moved house on May 24 (I was an npower customer for both gas and electricity at my old address) and rang them on 28 May to give them my final meter readings. They told me I would receive a final bill in about 28 days. I was asked to keep the direct debit mandate in force so they could collect any balance that may be due to them. They were the most competitive supplier so I signed up for the new house at the same time. Nothing happened so I rang again in early July. The guy said that they only had a note of one of the meter readings not both: unbelievable but that is what he said. He was able to calculate the refund due to me on the spot and said the refund and final bill would be with me within two weeks. Still nothing happened so I rang again on July 19. Another helpful person told me that there was a problem with the tariff and eventually passed me on to Complaints. They agreed that there was a tariff problem but could not give me a comprehensible explanation. I was told that Complaints may be able to resolve the issue themselves (which would take less than 48 hours) but, if they could not, it would have to be passed to another (unnamed) department and Complaints had no control over that department's timescale. In the meantime, two direct debits relating to the old account had been taken from my account after the date on which I moved house. The confirmatory letter said they aimed to deal with complaints within a staggering 28 working days - nearly six weeks. The six weeks are almost up and I have heard nothing. If I try to ring them, there is always a long queue. I e-mailed them asking for a call back, all I got was an e-mail two weeks later saying somebody would be in touch. I have received two letters from their Customer Services Director, one telling me about their wonderful service levels and another saying that they are having problems with billing. I cannot wait to receive their substantive reply - due any day now. I'm not holding my breath and can't wait for the end of my contract. I'll happily pay more for my gas and electricity to get rid of this hassle.
107|I dont make a habit of complaining (but feel like this deserved my time).Quite simply nPower provide the worst customer service I have ever experienced and if you are considering moving to them BEWARE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!I did a price comparison 2 years ago, nPower saved me a couple of quid a month and I set about moving to them from British Gas.Only paying GBP24 a month based on my tiny usage I was shocked to see my monthly rate go up to GBP38! so I got in touch with nPower. They explained they had a problem setting up my account as I banked with Snatander so someone! (mystical - someone!) put me on the standard tariff... without telling me (is the trouble)...They assured me all would be well and I'd get papers inside 28 days and online sign-on details too. OK I thought.Now I'd had my account 12 months and I gave a couple of months for the stuff to arrive but nada... nothing... and I was still being overcharged.I tried again on the phone, went through everything again, was assured all over again, and yet again months passed and nada... nothing... I've been lied to, ignored, I've raised formal complaints then been ignored some more. I've escalated complaints, been ignored further and finally after 6 weeks of no response from the complaints team - got an offer of GBP100 to compensate me for the delay.Problem is, I got my first true bill only 4 weeks ago and it dosn't add up - I went from a GBP90 cr to a GBP50 db inside 4 months and have been paying my regaulr amount all that time too!Seems the GBP100 gesture on nPowers part means nothing other than I have a slight cr balance - so OK I thought, now's the time to get out.I've moved my electricity supplier but am pursuing nPower for one final crazy mistake.Complaints told me in July that my original tariff closed in Feb 2013!!! WHAT ON EARTH!!!!! What tariff have I been on? What rate have I been paying? What terms are attached to this tariff????? I asked the question and quess what? YOUR RIGHT! They ignore me to this day.....In my experience you cannot trust nPower on any level whatsoever.The reviews speak loudly but if this helps only one person then it was worth while.Good luck all - shame on you nPower, shame on you...
108|If you think waiting over 7 days with a 6 month old baby for Npower to fix your boiler, so no hot water or heating, when its below freezing outside, is acceptable, then this is the company for you... according to their staff this is ok... even when the repair man turned up with a part that he suspected was faulty already forcing us to wait another 5 days. To top this off, having called my insurance who fixed the part the next day, Npower then refused to cover the new part, leaving me with 7 months cover that was practically useless as they wouldn't let me leave early... Finally, having argued this over the phone, the manager agreed to replace the new part with one of their own so it was covered... but then sent me a letter saying it wasn't... and when I complained apparently the managers phone calls are not recorded so I was a liar... fun fun fun.
109|Way back in July 2012, my boyfriend and I decided that we would have our gas and electricity supply changed from a token meter (in which we would top up GBP10 when needed) to be part of NPower's standard tariff receiving monthly bills instead; we were advised that this would be cheaper. The meters were taken out and we were told that we would be registered with the company and receive our first bill shortly. A month later we were still waiting and so decided to ring to find out where our bill was. We were told that NPower's system had not been updated with our information and subsequently we were not registered yet, a problem they would 'fix immediately'. Another month passed and still no bill, at this time we were getting slightly worried so we rang again and were told the same thing; the system hasn't been updated. This time we decided to make a complaint, which was passed on to the ombudsman to decide what happens with our case, but after this we still heard nothing from the complaints team nor NPower about our bill. After repeating this process of ringing up and begging NPower for a bill and to sort it out for nearly a year now, we finally received our first bill a few days ago- for GBP932. Yes that's right, GBP932. Obviously I was extremely angry and I rang up to complain. The woman told me that NPower had made a mistake and was billing us through the wrong account(our old token meter account on which we owe nothing) rather than the new one which should have been updated onto their system when we first had the meters changed. This is utter rubbish anyway as we haven't received any bills what so ever; we do not have an internet account with them and haven't had anything through the post. I was told that although this was entirely NPower's fault they could not lower the bill and we would have to pay all of it off. The woman also tried to justify NPower's poor service by saying 'even though you have received no bills, you should have been paying random amounts to NPower each month to stay on top of things'. Why the hell would I throw random amounts of money I don't have at NPower and hope that it will cover the costs? How about you send me a bill and then I will pay you what we owe? Sounds more sensible doesn't it NPower? Now I'm pretty much screwed, some smart arse out there will say 'you should have kept money aside for situations like this' well try doing that with a part time job with rubbish wages whilst trying to run a house when you are already paying insane extortionate amounts for rent, council tax, water rates etc etc. Then you will see how difficult it is to put any bulk sum of money aside. The woman said that we would have to set up a direct debit to pay off the amount but I don't see why I should have to, I will not accept responsibility for this when I have done everything in my power to sort it out. Anyone out there that doesn't enjoy being messed about and being in debt- DO NOT GO WITH NPOWER.
110|Took out boiler cover.They took 4 mths to fix the problem, took days to order parts and re-book engineers, the engineers had little or no knowledge of the boiler itself (a standard Vaillant), customer service non-existant.When I complained the person in CS that I was delaing with simply stopped communicating. She left me an answerphone message saying I'll call you tomorrow and after that I didn't hear from her again.There are definitely better companies out there for boiler cover. Try anyone but not npower. 
111|Where do I start?!Well to begin, we moved into a new property March 2012, attempted to acquire a gas bill from our energy company (nPower) on numerous occassions and finally received one in February 2013, a full 12 month bill I assumed and was for approx GBP330 which I thought for 12 months wasn't too bad...  I thought I had better check the meter so as not to get stung, and to my amazement it was actually lower than they estimated, I thought wonderful I'll get a lower bill (as is the norm when usually giving a lower meter read to the estimate!) Well how wrong was I?!  The bill I received went up by nearly GBP100!!This making no sense to me, so on the phone I went to customer services, may as well saved myself the time, they tried to confuse me with their already confusing tariff and charges and all that, I said had I just paid the original bill without changing the read I would end up paying less and be in credit next time, the gentleman on the end of the phone said that wouldn't have been the case and I would have been charged the same eventually any way, um how?! But to help me out I could set up a payment plan but would get charged extra for this!It seems to me they just make up their charges to suit them and get more money out of their customers! I said that your bills are to confusing and seem to mislead their customers, I had a letter a few weeks later saying that they acknowledge that they have a confusing bill method and were working to change it, and that the less energy you use the more you will pay!  I use less because I can't afford to pay for it not get chargedd for not using it!! Really?!!To top it off, I had a threatening letter in June to say that after many attempts to contact me and reminders sent that they were going to cut me off/send round the bayliffs etc, well I hadn't even been issued with a bill before that and wasn't due one, when I did get the bill they had added late payment charges before the bill was due to be paid!!  I complained and these were taken off but that just shouldn't have happened in the first place, how many people have they done that to that didn't bother to try and get it back?!My tip - don't bother with Npower, I think most energy companies may try and rip us off but these guys really do take the biscuit!!  Thank god they only supplied us gas!
112|I am supposed to manage my account online. However, since February due to technical issues, my bill has not been avaialble to view. This bill included news of a huge increase in my direct debit. Today, 5 months later it is finally available. A company the size of Npower should be able to fix this sort problem in days.
113|I took January Online 2014 tariff, assuming the prices are fixed until January 20144 (otherwise WHY would you call a tariff like this???). Not the case, in July 2013 prices jumped up, and you cannot quit because they will charge you adn you will loose annual GBP100 discount.Their prices are fakely cheap to attract you on comparison websites.Avoid by all means, you will lose more than you will save.
114|After being quoted a lower G+E price with Npower i switched a year ago and have now found out they have been reading a neighbours meter for the entire time ive been with them. Following a much lower reading which i provided them im apparently in the same amount of debt (GBP300) as with the higher meter reading!!? ive been told by them its still correct, and for all the original misleading payment amounts per month and unneccesary battling with them to sort out the right meter they have offered me GBP30 compensation!!! Suffice to say when this is all over i will never ever use Npower again as not only are they incapable of reading the correct meter the staff were unhelpful, not bothered and seem incapable of doing their job of providing relevant information regarding their prices. 
115|I moved to Npower in Feb 2013 due to EoN introducing standing charges and, frankly, I wish I hadn't and so am now in the process of moving again after a mere 5 months with them. In summary, the problems experienced included:- original direct debit payments 3x higher than agreed, which took several emails and phone calls and 3 months to resolve, by which time I was several hundred pounds in credit- vastly inflated meter reading estimates (despite providing them myself)- my own meter readings not being accepted because they were so much lower than their estimates- frustrating attempts to contact customer service. The reps were generally pleasant and helpful on the phone, but the problems were not resolved; email was generally more successful, but very slow responses (> a week)- poor online bill interface (for example: not updated when you provide new meter readings, difficult to find out exactly how much you owed or were owed at any particular time)- introduced a standing charge 3 months after I joined them and they told me they weren't going to. This would have increased my bill by about 60% and was the final incentive to leave- a month after switching away from npower, no final bill has been produced, meter reading history has been removed from my online account so I can't verify they have recorded the final readings correctly or that the final credit has been calculated correctly and the outstanding credit has not been repaid.You have been warned! I wish I had been, hence this review!
116|They really are total bullies, using there big status to bully customers into paying more than they should! Why aren't they being monitored??? 3 years of cancelled direct debits on there behalf, time after time and blaming my bank for it!!! I have had C.A.B, Debt agencies, Ombudsman trying to help but they lie and lie and lie in there letters to them an d I go round in circles.  It's now going to court to force me to have meter in my property, my consumption has jumped from GBP68 to GBP92 all of a sudden?? I am now being threatened with a warrant to put meters in even though I am paying!!!!DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY, when I eventually get away from these I will never ever use them again, I have several different tariffs, bills, and they even sent me a price increase through the internet even though I weren't set up, how the hell is this legal? I do not have the money but if I did I would go to court and prove they are liars, I have many different emails saying different things, they system fails time after time and they couldn't even provide a bill for two months because there system was down.The mysteriously loose paperwork and change your tariff, it really is disgusting!!! THEY DON'T DESERVE ONE STAR******************** DO NOT SWITCH TO NPOWER **************************** *********************** YOU WILL BE SORRY **************************
117|When I moved into my property, I was with NPower without choice until British Gas took over as the previous occupants were with NPower. Within the first month of being with them we paid in excess of GBP200 for gas. I called them several times to question this as I thought the bill we received was excessive. Was told that the charges were valid and that I should pay the bill or be faced with court action. I then discovered that we were billed so much because the previous occupant had not kept up with the bill, so I was paying their debt. Was told that I am not entitled to a refund of what I was over charged in my name, and basically that I should just deal with it. Finally British Gas took over! shortly afterward I recevied a final bill from NPower for 5 days worth of Gas supply, which was apparently GBP296.63 inclusive of VAT. Something clearly wrong there. After 6 calls to them being told that Im a liar, that the charges are valid and that if I did not pay, I would be taken to court. I obviously refused. The final call was escalated and the charges were investigated, and identified as invalid. Today I recieved a letter to confirm that these charges are incorrect and that I am in credit. Work that out?Take my advice, If you want to be ripped off and taken for a ride, join NPower, who I class as a joke factory. Had a vulnerable person received the bill, they would have just paid it without questioning it, allowing NPower to rip them off!
118|Cannot bill properly - sent me a bill for GBP10,000 (I live alone in a one bedroom flat with 3 radiators) and I finally left when my direct debit was increased to GBP200 a month from GBP70. Since then I have been unable to pay my final bill because  I have had goodness knows how many bills for differing amounts and goodness knows how many threatening letters - despite my being told my account had been put on hold and no more threatening letters would appear. The stress Npower causes is unimaginable and it is the worst company I have ever dealt with. All I want to do is pay my final bill but they cannot give me a correct figure and when you call to try and sort things out you get told there is a 17 minute wait so please hold (no offer that time to call me back) but even when you do get through to someone they cannot get it right. They dont even pay their taxes!!!
119|The very short version of our story is this:N-Power have been reading the wrong meter for 4 years and over charging us by quite a lot.For 4 years we have been complaining that the wrong meter is being read, all we get is excuse after excuse, absolutely nothing has been done.We are now having absolutely no choice at all having to take n-power to court to get our money back and finally end this nightmare.The worst customer service and complaints system in the world ever, they just simply don't care at all.
120|Called npower to tell them that I have moved out of my property and spoke to a lovely lady who took all of the details and my forwarding address and said that she would forward a bill if I owed them money.  The systems were down at the time but she seemed competent and friendly and I had trust that what she said would happen, would happen.  2 months later, no bill recieved and I get a text from npower to say that I need to take a meter reading and giving my account number.  When I rang npower and quoted the account number they had no notes of my prevoius discussion and also were unable to give me details as the account was in the name of The Occupier and not my name - YOU TEXT ME?  This account number was also different to my old account number also in the name of The Occupier as they never changed it in 7 years despite numerous telephone conversations.  They then couldnt find any details and started asking me how I made my payments to them and asking for bank statements showing prevoius payments.... WHAT??? the account is cleared up to when I asked for the outstanding bill to be sent to my new address!!!!!!  Apparently it will take up to 28 days to get a letter in my name and the prevoius 18 months of payments 'should' be allocated to my named account.  Terrible customer service, the worst I have experienced.  Am awaiting a call back, I won't hold my breath!
121|Last month, NPower told us we had to double our direct debits to almost GBP250 - this month we are nearly GBP500 in credit... are they incompetent or just trying to get their hands on a bit of extra cash?Either way, they are a greedy corporation who provide little in the way of customer service.
122|i changed over to npower in November 13, ihad been with them previously and left because of there poors accounting and overall poor customer service. I was told by one of there agents that they had improved how wrong was he.They asked to go on a monthly direct debit, I was quite happy to pay extra each month? In january 14 I contacted Npower and asked what was going on as they had not taken any monies fron my account. They then took a initial payment despite me sending them the monthly readings ( cost of gas, they should do it?. I then recieved an invoice to my surprise higher then the readings I gave them. I contacted Npower and asked what is going on with my account. The lady I spoke to said she would get the invoice changed, I explained that I should be on monthly billing which she agreed that it should have been set up monthly. I then said I have been sending emails with the readings, I told her the e-mail address and low and behold she said don't use that one and gave me another one? (why two). I receievd an amended invoice, but still no explanation why I was not on a monthly contract. Having had enough of Npower I rang them today to tell them that I would be moving they stated that I was in contract, I told them no you broke the contract by not doing what was agree at the start. The response I got was that its up to Npower how they bill there customers as per there terms and condition?, but surely they should have notfied me in writing. Why did they agree monthly and change it Conmerchants comes to mind. prehaps instead of sponsoring the football league they should use that money to employ more staff and better training.I have been told that someone from there complaint department (I bet thats well staffed) will ring me in the next 10 working days (two weeks great customer service)I strongly recommend that you don't use Npower its worth paying a bit extra  and get a company that cares for its customers.
123|REALY BAD, never seen anything so BAD service. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  
124|Dreadful service and communication is terrible, didn't even hear from them on a 6 monthly basis! Put me on very expensive tariff without telling me about online options (far cheaper) and ended up having to pay them huge extra amounts despite paying GBP130 per month for small 1 bed house. At one stage when i was rather a lot in credit they made it very difficult to get my cash back too. Switching away from them now and have just taken a call from a very rude lady attempting to retain my business... erm, I don't think so! Will never ever deal with this company again.
125|WORST COMPANY I HAD EVER DEAL WITH.WHEN MOVED TO A NEW PROPERTY DIDNT GET ANY LETTER FOR 6 MONTHS.WHEN I GET FIRST BILL IT WAS 489.00.AFTER IT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED FOR NOW REASON AND I GET ANOTHER ONE FOR 1899.00.END UP WITH A DEBT 2345.00 DESPITE I BEEN PAYING 160.00 EACH MONTH FOR A STUDIO FLAT!!! IT IS UNBELIEVABLE! AVOID THIS COMPANY ANY COST!!!
126|Do I really have to give them a star?I transferred to Npower 6 months ago and it's been a catalogue of errors, it's still not sorted out.  They transferred my electric, my gas is STILL with Ovo.  They haven't set up my direct debit.  They've put me on the wrong tariff.  I transfer power companies on a regular basis but I will NEVER use Npower again.I ring them every couple of weeks for an update on my complaint but all they tell me is there is a technical problem and they can't transfer my gas.  Apparently I'm not the only customer but I can't find anything else on the internet from other customers with the same issue.At this rate my contract until Jan 2014 will have expired before they get my gas transferred.DON'T USE NPOWER - THEY ARE RUBBISH
127|"Customer service very poor. I pay by direct debitbut they seem unable to set it up properly. The electricity was set up but they were going to reduce my payments to GBP36.00 / month and the gas was not set at all even though I gave them readings over the phone. Rang them in March to complain and give new readings, was told that it was set up and would be passed onto the ""back office"". Rang again today,it is still not set up and now we owe over GBP500 for gas.Given new readings and asked for a bill.Total shambles, will be paying the bill and moving to another supplier as soon as possible. Moved to save money and now in a mess. Apparently, unless the customer rings they don't contact you even if they have a problem.Discussed!!!!       "
128|When I switched to Npower last year they only switched one utility at first then the other one 2 months later, they then did not take any direct debit payments for a further 3 months causing me to be in debt to the tune of GBP345 as of August 2012. Now in May 2013 they have decided to put up my direct debit payment from GBP122 per month to GBP250 per month as I am currently in debt to them of GBP350, big surprise!!! they said it was my fault and tried to blame me for increased usage, which is not true at all.I tried to explain that I can not afford to pay this much of an increase, who on earth could afford to pay GBP250 per month just for gas and electric?They were not at all helpful and because of their incompetence I am having to really struggle for the next few months to try to pay off this when it was not my fault.
129|Great Service while you are with them, as soon as you want your account reviewed to see if they can offer you a better tariff, NOT INTERESTED.  Then try leaving.... I have made constant phone calls to ask for a final bill even though we have been confirmed not in arrears, 3 months later no final bill received, they ask you to keep your account open for the refund due, instead they take further money out of your account not even on the agreed direct debit date.  Contact them, and the answer is always wait 28 days.  Still no final bill, and no refund, even though we have switched suppliers and keep contacting them, absolutely disgusting.  have since looked at the NPowers complaints they shouldnt be allowed to trade it seem like it is the same thing over and over again. 
130|I have been very impressed by Npower, which is something I never would imagined I would say about a utility company!I got landed with a very expensive bill which I knew was coming, as we had a new supply set up when we built our house but had only paid on an estimated figure.When I informed Npower of the reading, I knew it would be expensive and it was but they were so helpful, telling me that I could pay the amount owing spread out over 3 years with no interest, also they based this on the lowest tarrff possible, which lowered the bill by almost GBP1000.00!They also estimated my new monthly usage amount which also was quite high for me to afford, but again they put me on the lowest tariff and really lowered the amount I have to pay each month.They have never pestered or harrassed me for payment whilst this has all been going on and were happy to deal with everything via email instead of me sitting on the phone for hours at a time.There responses were quick, efficient and helpful.I am very impressed and would recommend them to anyone.  They are the best utility company I have ever dealt with and really eased my stress and worry about the debt we owed.
131|they get a one star purely for the fact that they have provided me with electricity - beyond that they are completely and utterly useless.  I asked them to investigate in February 2013 when they doubled my bill overnight.  I found a cheaper tariff and asked to move to it.  They informed me that they would reduce my future direct debits by 25% then failed to do it.  I am still waiting for a satisfactory explanation as to how my bill could double (without any change in usage). Trying to get through to them is a nightmare and emailing is completely pointless as they either ignore your emails completely or send you utter rubbish and inconsistent.  They did send me an email thanking for notifying them of my change of name - I haven't changed my name. Take my advice and do not switch to them!  
132|"I have been with them not for long. After joining npower what do you get?!  Very very poor customer services in which customers are treated with disrespect and even threaten by saying they will ""take action""! They deny their mistakes and blame customers! Honestly speaking I recommend you do NOT join them as it is a waste of time. Not even worth a star!"
133|"They will taunt& harangue you with letters. Letters that contradict and are full of 'estimates'. They will threaten legal action based on estimates. YES thats how ignorant and offensive they are. They will take large chunks of your bank account money and it is hard to get it returned.- Sure, they say sorry.. but wouldn't you rather just have your GBP400 back? It might even get to the point where each unwarrented letter brings forth violent and distressing thoughts.Sure they'll write ""sorry"" but by now you'll realise you cannot trust them with your bank details.  Anyway, their letters are cut & paste efforts. You're getting emotional whilst they're getting rich and they dont care about YOU."
134|having been with n power never really had much of a problem apart from me paying a little more a month that other supplier well that was untill i left them now been hit with a crazy bill which it seems all my payments have went to gas and not electricity. Girl on phone very unhelpfull as i explained the payments have been split by them and not myself so now changing to a cheaper energy supplier has cost be a lot more in the long run.  i think they do this on purpose so when people try and leave they can because they are hit with a bill they may not be able to pay. 
135|I feel they have total contempt for their Customer Base. Having been a loyal customer for several years they have treat me so bad I had to go to the Ombudsman to resolve the issue. They even messed them around and have breached their letter by not complying (hope this is seen by Offgen). Having complained several times they just don't get back to you; they promise the world but then do nothing (and this is at Manager level!). They are now refusing to talk to me which again is unacceptable and said that I must go through the Ombudsman. Apparently this is also not the way I should be treat (may I add I have been nothing but polite to these people). I would never go with this company again. Please read similair reviews and the 'Which' report before you go with npower!!!!!!
136|"After 1 year (yes that's right) and over 10 hours of telephone conversations, NPower have finally issued me with a ""final bill""!In April 2012 I elected to switch my provider from NPower to Sainsburys Energy. It has taken until now (May 2013) for NPower to agree to issuing a final bill. I had always paid my bills on time by direct debit, always provided up to date meter readings both during my time with them and at the end of that time yet they have shown the most appalling customer service I have ever encountered with any company in any sector.I have spoken to numerous customer service personnel on numerous occasions, wasting many hours of my own time to get to this point. On multiple occasions during the last year I was promised a final bill within 10 or 28 days. Nothing materialised.They even removed money from my bank account by mistake, and it took me contacting them for it to be paid back, despite written promises it would paid back within days.I have heard that they have locked many of their accounts (due to a problem with new complete software) therefore making it impossible to generate bills. I am shocked at NPower's complete incompetence, rudeness and inability to give any answers.Needless to say, I will never use their services ever again and will make sure that as many people as possible are aware of how appalling NPower are."
137|"I inherited npower by moving into a new house and not having the time to look elsewhere. I have never had one accurate bill, mainly because they send the meter reader round between 9-5 when everybody is out at work!! When i pointed this out to the customer service people, they said that they employed a third party contractor to do this and had no control over it - brilliant, buck passed, well done. The first occasion I rang with meter readings,  but they then ""forgot.."" to send out a new bill. Several weeks later they sent a further estimated bill which was  300 % over estimated! Once again I had to spend an age on the phone trying to insist that I be allowed to pay my bill and providing them with up to date meter readings. They couldnt calculate it at the time but promised an accurate bill within 7 days. Less than a week later I got a threatening letter telling me to contact them within 7 days or their collection team would ""contact you and visit your home"" and ""may apply for a warrant from the court to enter... ""Letters like this can be very intimidating to many people and when they are cause by incompetence, it makes it doubly annoying.Im currently looking for a new supplier. Looking at npowers reviews, Im surprised they have any customers at all. Truly awful company, with incompetence and indifference at every level. "
138|This company is absolutely terrible, it needs a complete shake up and a review of all customer service processes, they seem to be completely incompetent at setting up a direct debit, we have constantly been left in huge shortfalls so even if we wanted to leave the company we couldnt as we would have to pay the oustanding balance, after being reassured on several times that everything is ok, the next time a payment comes out, it is always wrong, leaving us overdrawn and having to contact them, they insist on only issuing 6 month statements, so you wouldnt even know what situation your account was in for months! How this company can still trade and obtain customers is beyond me, will be leaving them as soon as possible!! I would avoid them at all costs unless you want months, if not yearsof headaches!
139|Took them 2 months to complete my switch in Oct 2012. It took them a month to respond to my application. I should have read the ominous signs of a poor company and stopped the switch. Now, 7 months later and despite numerous e-mails, complaints and phone calls, they are still incapable of setting up a direct debit. I am completely happy to pay a penalty and leave this company. Sign to them at your peril.
140|Since joining npower in September 12, we have left meter readings in good faith on the cards left by their meter read agents, only they didn't bother to come back for them. This has resulted in us getting slammed with a huge shortfall bill and they attempted to increase our DD from GBP111.00 per month to a collosal GBP253.00 per month - more than double!! I paid the shortfall bill just yesterday and the idiot who took the payment messed it up.  Now I am down GBP325.00 but npower have no idea where that money has gone!!!  To put a top hat on it I have come home tonight to a reminder for another bill for GBP100 which I have never even seen and is not on my online account - I have been hanging on the phone since 5:45pm tonight, and finally got someone on the phone at 7:20pm only to be told that nobody could take my call!!!  I told her to walk on in quick jerky motions, I am so angry it's untrue!!!!Do yourself and your bank balance a huge favour and DO NOT EVEN LOOK at npowers prices as it WILL cost you dearly in the long run.  I will be taking my case to the energy Ombudsman and also to Watchdog as these people need to be stood up to and exposed for the what they really are.
141|"I've had no end of problems with Npower, mainly involving billing. The billing system just doesn't seem to work properly and the latest bill they have issued me doesn't even add up. The numbers seems to have been generated at random. The last two bills I've had to ring up and have calculated manually because they are just plain wrong. They then calculate your bill over 13 months but based on 9 monthly payments (or at least, they do for me), hence they always try to put the direct debit up. So then you have to ring up and argue the case. The last few times I've been called I've been told the current wait time is ""more than one hour"". Thankfully you can leave your number to be called back, but any company whose call queue time goes above 1 hour has a serious problem with the number of staff they have answering calls.Their latest trick is to introduce a standing charge on all tariffs, which has put my energy costs up by nearly 1/3 overnight, as for gas alone it is over GBP150 a year standing charge ( it was GBP0 ). "
142|"Why is it so challenging to run a consumer energy firm? I really dont know what it is that npower does as they seem to give little to no consideration to their customers.The main issues have been in contacting npower in regards to anything!1. moved into new flat, existing resident had given incorrect final reading, tried to correct took 3 months and 6 bills for incredible amounts, including the allegation that one month I had used 99,998 Kw of energy in a month - ITS A TWO BED FLAT NOT AND INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.2. Phoning in - always takes for ever, I have never waited less than 40 mins to speak to an ""adviser"" but they have been of limited uses anyway.3. online - the system so rarely works that it is almost exciting when I can get access once every other month to look at the most recent debacle. It is almost always out of date, how hard is it to update a system semi regularly.4. The App - it makes apple maps look like a roaring success... What angers me is that I pay for you to waste money building this awful app, that forces me to call your decrepit call centers, which takes so long I try to log on to the shambolic online system leading me to write this hate filled reviews. How hard can it really be... honestly?"
143|To be fair, when things are going well, these people are ok and not badly priced in today's market. HOWEVER, when things go wrong, you have to deal with the customer service people,and that's where the problems start. Customer service is vitually non existent. Their way of dealing with an enquiry is to ignore it, and if you make a complaint that they've ignored it... well, they ignore that as well. An abysmal performance in line with their customer satisfaction rating on the Which survey - 
144|was paying 80 a month for a year was told this was the avarage for my house then sent a bill for 400 in credit at the end of the first year now i have a bill for 965 pounds and 230 pounds amonth dd after 2 years and was told they made an error.computers are always down or slow.staff are not trained very well.would not use this company by choice.but they are all like this
145|Truly awful customer service when switching from another supplier. Regret the decision now, but unable to cancel as the switch has already gone through according to my current supplier. DON'T DO IT!!!!
146|im an on-line customer....i switched my account to ebicoi queried the increase in d debit, they replied via  email that my d debits would remain the same old amount, next bank statement they`d taken the new d debit 85% increase from my account. even though i was already GBP100 in credit and was leaving them within 2 weeks!they cannot be trusted and as such , should not be able to take direct debits from any accounts.
147|If there had been the option to give Npower 0 stars this would have been my choice! Unfortunately, I happened to move to a property supplied by Npower, they would never have been my choice due to their terrible reputation. This reputation is well and truly deserved! My case is too complicated to go in to detail but they are currently preventing me moving suppliers through their own error. They don't return calls when they promise to, they can't even change the account name from the occupier to mine, causing massive problems, they don't respond to complaints and charge very high prices. I can't advise strongly enough to AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!
148|We pay gas and electricity by direct debit and the amount is reviewed every 6 months based on usage. Newest statement they increased our monthly bill by GBP60 pound. If you read the tables of numbers, what they did was calculated your likely costs over next 13 months, then make you pay this over 10 months, of course the monthly bill will be high! I think they do this on purpose so they hang on to your money and return to you at a much later date or hold it in the account and not return it you at all. Get vast amounts of interest on your money this way, if they do it to every single customer.For those who don't have time or patience to check their statement, they probably will end up paying extra.Only redeeming feature was they corrected the calculations right away when you ring them. But get it right in the first place would be nice.
149|thks a lot n power, a house of 4 people, with only one cooking and not even every day and you charge me GBP90 for gas??how do you come up with these numbers?am I paying for someone else's bills or for YOURS?that's hw you make your milions by robbing people who work and mak e a decent living???
150|Switched to npower last October.  I sincerely wish I'd stuck with Scottish Power.  My problems with Npower are too long-winded to write on a review but what I'd like the public to know is that Npower Customer Service is non-existent.  Their staff are lovely to speak to on the phone (if you can get through), but seem to be completely powerless to sort out any problems.  I spoke to numerous members of staff about my problem and it's still not resolved, five months down the line.  Also their website is extremely difficult to get onto and, even if you manage to get onto it, you'll be lucky if you can get an email through to them.  I tried several times, it kept crashing, till I gave up.Incredibly frustrating, I wish I'd never switched to Npower.
151|Absolutely appalling customer service, i have now logged two complaints with Npower one of which was extremely urgent and was sent 10 days ago and although i received a generic acknowledgement to both complaints i have not received a verbal or written response from anyone and my issue is still unressolved. I was also informed that my complaints have not been logged on their systems as complaints so they are clearly misrepresenting their level of complaints by doing this to customers!!! I have spent hours of my time emailing and calling this company to get back bank charges and other charges i have incurred due to THEIR ERROR and nearly one month after the error occured and after numerous hours of my time emailing, writing and speaking to them i am still waiting for my charges to be refunded...this is the worst customer service experience i have ever received and i will not be remaining a customer of NPower!!
152|I have had a problem with my gas supply I have been on hold to n power for 1 hour and 15 mins and I am still on hold its ridiculous 
153|I've received a letter from them today (8.4.2013)and I'm absolutely fuming. 'We've been checking our records and have discovered an error on the last bill or statement we sent you you. We did not apply our November 2012 price increase so you have been undercharged for the energy you've used. We've now corrected your account and will send you a new bill or statement shortly.'Is that MY fault? I think NOT. There isn't even a hint in this letter of how much they intend to increase the cost of my bill by which is already GBP117 a month for dual fuel, on top of that, I am currently unemployed. Their customer service employees are unhelpful and vague and they don't seem to care if you tell them you've had enough of their continuing extortionate price increases and intend going elsewhere. If you tell them you can't afford to pay their disgracefully inflated prices, they suggest a key meter - an even bigger rip off. They tempt you in with their special offers and once they catch you in their spiders web like a helpless fly, after a while they show their true colours. I wish I'd done my homework before I changed from my previous fuel supplier, then I'd have avoided nppwer like the plague. 
154|"The new rates coming in May, the ""simple tariff"" they call it, will see my gas cost more then double. I only use GBP3-GBP6 a month depending on season and now the minimum will be GBP13.5 a month. Who thought of that stupid idea. I'm leaving them."
155|"After I moved to my new apartment, they never sent me any bill for the first 5 months until I got a letter stating I owe them 400 pounds for only the first 3 months! How is this possible considering that I did not even give them any meter reading and they only charged me based on their ""estimated prices""?Do you know any other electricity supplier that will make 400 pounds as an estimated price for 3 months? I am a single occupier, I am only home at night so my use of electricity is certainly not that high!They are just stealing your money. In my previous apartment, I was with Southern electric and guess what?I had a bigger house and used more electricity but paid only 25 pounds a month!! "
156|Endless problems with the account since day one. Customer service non existent, stated it would take up to a month to sort out the problem they had created and if I wanted to speak to a manager to complain they'd call me back some time over the following 2 weeks!!I run my own business and if I treated customers like they do I'd be bankrupt very quickly. Take heed my friends, switch to this company at your peril.
157|I have been with Npower for a year,and went one of their fixed tarriffs...a duel energy tarriff. It did start at 70 pound a month, but gradually crept to 95 a month. My tarriff runs out on the 8th of April,so i have been looking around on comparison sites. To cut a long story short, all the ones i did see didn't offer me any difference to Npower. I think the end of the day,they are all the same. I found customer service to be very helpful, and have joined them once again, for another year at a fixed rate. And have so far saved 15 pound a month with them.I just thought i would write this review,in case anybody out there was thinking of joining Npower. I think we can all have bad experiences,with any of the big energy companies out there.The girl i spoke to was very helpful and explained everything(even though i did find some bits confusing).I hope my review has been some help.
158|gave meter reading from previous address (prepayment) & given refund. then received bill for GBP5.32 for electricity & 'refund' of GBP5.59 for gas on same day. then received GBP25.32 bill for electricity. called npower & asked for call back. no call back. called again after threatening letter. told account would be put on hold. it wasn't. received another threatening letter so called again. on hold for over 1 hour. simply the worst of the worst !!!!!!
159|"I applied to switch my dual-fuel (Electric and Gas) from eON to NPower early December 2012, after many chases with no correspondance I finally had a welcome letter in March 2013 from nPower, but noticed it was for electric only!!After many more chases I was told they had computer system problems after a change to a new system and the gas was ""stuck"".They quoted another 40 days to get the gas online!! (still on-going today).That would make it over 4 months to get me switched! In the meantime I have no dual-fuel discount and my gas is still with eON on out of contract prices!I am losing a load of money on this switch and wouldn't recommend NPower at all."
160|i'm is costing me more just for daily charge an i pay a month now how this right  
161|I left this company on 4th January 2013 and still await refund of GBP101.24 credit which sits on my account.  I have used the online complaints form twice and requested a refund and had no reply.  Then I tried to phone them and found the complaints line had a minimum of 45 minutes wait time.  I am not entirely sure how to make contact with them and how to evidence that I have tried via the website as there is no option to have your complaint copied to your email.  I say stay well clear of this company, this is daylight robbery!
162|I rang to inform them my dad had died and needed the account changing into my 82 year old's mum's name. They said they needed a letter with her details and a copy of the death certificate which we sent. Two months later a bill was received in my dad's name (no other correspondence received) so when we telephoned they said they had sent an email to my dad - I checked his emails and they had indeed sent him one in response to our letter a month after he had died asking him to phone their customer services team!! After a long phone call they have now sent a bill for 9p despite the previous bill being paid in full and a letter to my mum saying that they will help reduce the stress over her moving address even though she is moving nowhere. No apologies, no condolences. Total cock-up would not recommend them in a million years.
163|I changed supplier in December 2012 from Npower to Eon. I provided both parties with my electricty and gas readings. In January having heard nothing I rang Npower who said it would take 40 days for a refund. After this I sent an email complaint which on the website says will be responded to in the next 24hours. Several days later I was contacted and told that they had not received the electricity reading from Eon. I was told this would be sorted shortly once Eon had passed on the information. In early March still no refund. I rang again and was put through to complaints but cut off! Eventually I gave hem my electricity meter reading and told it would take another 28 days for a refund. Two more email complaints and no response. I rang again on Friday 3 days ago and was told someone would call me back that day with answers -  I'm still waiting. I have contacted the Obudsman but no response from them yet. No refund and dreadful service. After 4 months no refund.
164|Been with n power for around a year and a half I have 2 metres one for day and one for night N power advisor's was asking for readings the wrong way round also 2 n power metre readers did the same Also one of my metres stopped working no one noticed the readings wasnt changing until I did took them 2 months to sort this and was told this would leave me in credit apparently I have used GBP1800 in electric in a year hmmm I live in a 1 bedroom house total Bull  and now having to pay the remainder owing with them offering me a GBP50.00 courtesy charge avoid n power !! 
165|Npower has got to be 1 if the worst companies in the country. would not recommend any 1 to go with them. trying to get away from them is not easy.if you need to phone them make sure you have a couple of hours to spare. no doubt they are busy trying to deal with complaints from thier victims 
166|not a bad company till you have a problem and believe me you will have a problem! they dont give a toss!
167|"I was sent a court summons without actually having been sent the bill to which it apparently related (either electronically or via post).  I spent literally hours on the phone talking to various people that seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I only received a grudging apology on the phone at the end of the fiasco for which a computer eror was eventiually blamed.  I switched supplier before Christmas and despite having been sent final gas and electricity bills from Npower I now still being sent more 'final bills' in March.  Today I rang the call centre and after a 20 minute wait got through to an advisor whom informed me that 'due to the high volume of calls' they were not taking any more calls this evening.  "" I am talking to you now"" I pleaded, but she didn't seem to understand.  I arranged for thenm to call back for tomorrow and then she explained that tomorrow would actually be Monday.  ""But tomorrow is Saturday and the ""customer service"" line operates on Saturdays"", I pleaded again.  She explained that Npower operate from several call centres and this one did not operate on a Saturday. The service is so bad it feels like I'm the subject of a ""Fonejacker"" prank call sometimes. Hopeless. Steer clear at all costs."
168|"I knew NPower were terrible when watching a documentary in my teens a few years ago. I have rented property for over 5 years and am quite familiar with how much we should be paying, when I saw a letter saying ""sorry you're leaving FINAL BILL"" from NPower in my new rental I was overjoyed. Only to get a bill for GBP180 for 2 months of gas use!. Called and waited for hours to speak to rude and hostile staf. Eventually someone advised us not to pay it as its extrordinarily high especially since the heating is on for 1 hour a day in a 2 bed propery. Only to get a bill for GBP489!! We paid it just so we can leave even though we thought we had left already. I can't believe I somehow got sucked into the evil company that is NPower, then they announce their profits and its STUPIDLY RIDICULOUS amounts. Greedy humans treating other hardworking people like peasants. Anyway I would say stay away. Change as soon as you realise you are with NPower"
169|I was charged GBP1212 for 6 mths for 2 bed flat . I went to citizen advice bureau for help, on our first call we were told our meter was changed in jun 12 that has caused this big amount when meter was changed in 2010. Called again we were given different rates then what we were actually charged with. Third call from bureau she told us that we were withthem for 411 days and charged 2.99 a day which citizen advice bureau thought is fair enough but actuallywe were with n power for 6 months which is 182 days. When we called them to clear it out they gave me different charge per day 6.82 so that total amount come up to what they have billed us.. Everytime we called npower the total amount was same GBP1212 but they were working it out either with extra days added on to the bill or by putting up the charges. Everytime citizen advice bureau called them on our behalf, we were given wrong information.
170|When i switched supplier in november i received a letter from npower telling me that they would send a final bill but nothing arrived.  I contacted them in january but tne computer system was down as a recorded message told me and the call was automatically terminated .the following week 700.00 was taken ouf of my bank account which left me overdrawn and i incurred bank charges. I contacted npower and was on the phone for 50 minutes before i could get them to agree to credit my bank account, was told this would be done in5 to 7 days but 2 weeks later i M still waiting  its 30 years sincs the utilities wers privatised which has been at the expense of the consumer avoid this company at all costx though
171|Only been with them since December. Constant e-mails to set up the direct debit and use it have either failed or been ignored. I'm going back to SSE as Npower have negated the fixed price contract. I have a vision of Npower working from a candlelit shed at the bottom of a garden.
172|This company is a disgrace. I have used a minimum of gas , and yet have been charged hundreds of pounds standing charges, for nothing.They do not tell you there are better tariffs available. When I complainedthey said I should have looked on the internet for better deals.So there must be thousands of others , especially older customers,who are being ripped off through their standing charge, and don'teven realise it. Avoid NPower like the plague!
173|Having been with nPower for ten years I decided to switch away when they increased their prices in late 2012.  Got a letter saying final bill would be sent within 30 days of switching on 15th November.  Phoned them on the 7th January to say I had no final bill and now well over 30 days.  Phoned today (23rd January) to be told it could be another 40 days from the 7th Jan.  That would be nearly 3 months from switch !!Suspect they owe us money that they want to hold on to.Would give NO STARS if this was allowed.
174|"We left N Power just before Christmas to go to another company due to poor service, We gave our new company the meter readings and also passed them onto N power. N power then informed us that we were owed GBP250 and that they would deal with this within 10 days. 10 days came and went but no cheque. So we phoned them up and they told us that our complaint had been loged and it would be delt with within 14 days. We waited 20 days but no cheque, So we phoned them again, the young man on the phone said that they were very sorry but they were having problems with there meter reading service and our complaint would be loged and delt with within 10 days and were we happy with this, to which my wife said ""yes""( remember this word). ""Guess what""! 15 days later no Cheque. But his time when we phoned the young lady told us that our paperwork was in the pending pile waiting to be looked at and would not be seen for ( you guessed it !!) 10 days. We informed her that we had been waiting since Christmas and also loged a complaint, To which she informed us that the complaint had been successfully resolved as when my wife was happy with the outcome of the last phone call (remember the ""Yes"" word)and if we wished to make a complaint the whole thing would have to start again.  Ombudsman here we come . They are dealing with it now !!!!!!"
175|I was invited to view my bill online. But as always the system for viewing is a complete joke. And on each occasion when you ring the customer services you get that excuse that they are very busy and that they can take an hour to answer your call. How many 0perators do they have? I find the whole experience of dealing with npower draining and i feel that my life just wants to ebb away. I,m paying this company top dollar for my energy but the customer services are not reflective of all the hype and spin you get on adverts etc etc. If I were to be behind with my payments then there so called customer services would sure be in touch with me pretty dam quick. 
176|I am a landlord acting on behalf of my father who has dementia.  We now have to sell the house to pay for his care costs.  I have been trying all morning to contact someone in npower (my ex-tenant's power supplier) to continue the service and sign the direct debit form on my father's behalf.  All the phone numbers require a customer service number, which obviously I do not have.  There is no option on the computerised menu for any other service.  Even the complaints form on the web site requires a customer number. I tried the new clients number but it disconnected me after 15 minutes.  I tried an email address but it just automatically referred me to the phonenumber which guess what, required a customer service number. I shall never ever use npower given a choice, and although my supplier - southern electric - may be more expensive their customer service is great
177|Quite happy to take your money but when it comes to leaving them and trying to get your `in credit` refunded they dont want to know and string you along.Switched my dual fuel supply from N-Power before Xmas and received my final gas bill dated 30 jan showing I was GBP446 in credit. Advised to wait up to 30 days for the refund to be issued. Phoned 9 march to find out what was happening and was told `Oh we dont appear to have sent you your final Electric bill`and they are now asking for me to wait another 10 working days till I receive that and then allow yet another 30 days for any refund due to me.Anyone thinking of using N-Power be warned!
178|I left Npower end November. I was GBP250 in credit. It is now over 3 months later and I still, despite numerous phone calls and an escalation to the complaints department, do not have my money (unless a cheque that my bank rejected counts!) Communication has been one sided, involving me ringing them at least once a week since January. When I asked for a record of our conversations I was told there would be a GBP10 charge. And when I asked how soon they would want money if I owed it to THEM, they said it would be referred to the collections team if not received within 14 days. And I would get a bad credit rating! I have reached the point where I actually WANT  them not to give me the money so I can put it in the hands of an ombudsman. I don't know how many customers' money they have, but they've had GBP250 of mine in their bank for three months when it should be in mine! Thank heavens interest rates are so poor that money sitting in a bank earns nothing...I guess that's another forum...
179|I am not the one for writing reviews or complaining, but as I am sitting on hold to npower complaints team with an estimated 30 min wait I need to air my frustration.  It's been four months since I switched both gas and electricity to npower.  I have still not had any paperwork through, I still have not anything to tell me what I am being charged and they have still only transferred electricity but not gas.  I have rang them on average every week but go nowhere.  Apparently there is a fault on their billing system so they cant bill me for gas so they are not providing me with gas and there is a fault in their paperwork system so they can't send anything out. It's a shame there is no 0 star option or I would have used it.
180|I was with Npower and moved address.....simple, or it should have been. It took 8 months to have my account finalised for my old address, during that time they took direct debits out for both addresses and wouldn't refund one. I spent so many hours on the phone asking for my bill that when it was settled I decided to change suppliers. I have just received my third incorrect final bill, Dated December 2012 and to be paid today, the day after it came through the post.(money I was in credit on my old account hasn't been transferred to this one)I refuse to ring, spending hours on the phone to be told it will be corrected only to receive promises it will be corrected. An appaling company, I have never had to deal with any company so thoroughly incompetent.
181|This is the worst company ever!!  Everything from start to finish has been a total nightmare.they said my payments would be cheaper with them so I change company and my payments were 70 pound per month to start with,then they shot up to 170 pm,i was only paying 77 pound with my original supplier they also moved my taffif i was on without even telling me, moved me to a more expensive one ! When I changed to a different supplier, they closed my account sent me a 65 pound credit, then 2 months later sent me a bill  for 160 pounds ! They said they calculated it wrong, So stressed out with these people!!! :(     Avoid !!!!
182|Company repaid part of a credit balance then doubled the monthly DD.I told them this was ridiculous as they had needed to pay me over 70 pounds credit back after the yearly review.They ignored this and so i left.I told them they were not authorised to take the larger sums, but they did anyway.^ months after leaving, and despite numerous emails and a promise from them they would pay the GBP80+ credit generated mostly from the one increased payment they took, they are still holding the money.They ignore emails, only responding when a complaint is raised with the ombudsman, and still don't repay the credit even them.
183|I have never experienced worse service in my life, it is absolutely disgusting. You cannot speak to anyone, when you eventually do its like talking to a person from another planet. Quite honestly I am going to change ALL of my business with this company and that includes all of the  companies that I own and NEVER will they get mine, my companies or any of my families business again. If I run a company like N Power I would have gone bust a long long time ago.
184|We moved into a flat in March last year only to find that the previous occupant wasnt an occupant they were a business, so had a business account with npower. This took us Months to sort out because even after i patiently filled out all the forms to switch from business to residential (Domestic)  they still kept sending us business bills. So for a time we were receiving 2 bills for the same thing every time. this finally got sorted out only to be replaced with more problems. Every single time we receive a bill we have been over charged. We kept complaining and every month after a few phone calls we would finally get our bill reduced or money back, This has happened all year. But recently we have received a bill which is 3 times the correct amount and they are making it very difficult to sort it out. I have been on hold multiple times for over 45 minutes only to be cut off or put through to someone telling me there is no one available to take my call. I would strongly advise against using npower as your energy provider. Seriously avoid them at all costs. They have been the cause of massive stress for me and they really dont do anything to make it any better. 
185|Liars . Moved into a property that had key meters and previous Tennant had a debt . Every GBP10 of my money took GBP8 debt ! Tried to ring them (which takes minimum of half hour on hold ) hen through was told to go to a shop (specific one which was miles away) to put on the credit if lost ! Shop had no reference and went back home to another hour long phone call . They assured me all done and go back to shop .... Nope they had not received the part they needed . Another call to them (another hour ) they are sending me petrol money and assure me that they would ring at 12 today . It's now 4:40 and no call !!! As I type this I am sat in a queue to get through to them (now half an hour ) . These people lie to you and surely a complaints dept should answer there phone within 10 mins !! Never ever use this company again ! 
186|Must stay away from them!!! They are like a leech, once they got your details, they will stick on you and trying their best to suck your blood.  I can assure you that you definitely dont want to touch them. Here is my story: on the early of November 2012, I used u switch website to try to find a cheap energy supply, at that moment Npower has the chepest tariff, so I sent an application to Npower through uswitch. But after I have read reviews about npower, I decided to withdrawn my application from them, So I especially phoned them up and told them I would like to withdraw my application and I do not want to join npower. The man who answered my phone told me: its ok, no problem.  On December 2012, I have found my current energy suppler and I joined them on Jan, 2013. I am very happy with my new supplier since then. But suddenly,I received a letter from npower on middle of Jan, 2013 telling me they are very happy for me to join them, I was shocked, so I immediately phoned Npower, asked them why did they send me the welcome letter, I already instructed them back in November, 2012 that I do not want to join them. They told me its a mistake, and asked me just ignore the letter. Then, one month later, on Feb, 2013, I got an email from my current supplier telling me that npower is trying take over my energy supply. I was so shocked, the next day, I called Npower again. It took me nearly half of the day to reach them. In the end, I have spoken 3 people from npower, telling them to stop trying to take over my energy supply as I already have withdrawn my application back on November, 2012. They all said: yes, they got my message now. But one week later, they did again trying take over my energy supply. So far, they have tried 3 times now, and I dont know how many more times are they going to try, but one thing for sure that they can never be succeed. It seems they can not get the message from the other people, no matter how many times you told them, they talk to you on the phone is one thing; they continue to do whatever they think supposed to do is another. I think they are really enjoy wasting other people's time. What a horrible customer service!In my opinion, they are just like a leech, once they got your details, they will stick on you and trying their best to suck your blood.  I can assure you that you definitely dont want to touch them. 
187|Quick to take the dosh off you but Jesus try getting it back off them!!! Totally disgusted by the customer service if you could call it that,  sick of being told 'I don't know'!! Trying to tell them that this is not an acceptable answer as to why I am not receiving my GBP400 credit and why they are still taking money off me! So so so angry that it takes forever to even get the facts of the problem down and then an absolute AGE for anyone to 'attempt to fix it'. And just when's you think everything is finally sorted........another letter or phone call f-ing everything up again! 
188|Numerous failing with this company right from the start..incorrect billing..(and bills in wrong names?), not sticking with original monthly quote after a comparison, but what really annoyed me was the over estimating of my direct debit, even though they were given likely usage by previous supplier and regularly supplied with meter readings throughout an 18 month period. My d/d was set way too high, and at a half way review even with the account in credit by GBP600+ after bills were paid..the monthly d/d was increased again..I then had to fight to get MY credit back. (also they can only credit under GBP500 at a time).Found also they assured things would be rectified each time..and then they weren't and would involve having to call again and repeating the problem from the start. The annual GBP100 cashback is a good incentive to join them and overall, prices are good..but I'm afraid the hassle that comes with it, simply wasn't worth it for me. I ditched and switched..
189|The worst customer service I have received for sometime. Typically having to wait upto 40 minutes to speak to someone, then consistently getting 'cut off' when they try to transfer you to another department. I had given meter readings and my name and I was getting charged approx 160 pounds plus for a small 2 bed flat. After eventually managing to discuss this with someone after previously being cut off twice on previous calls am told that they have been o charging me by 10 pounds per week. They attempted to blame this on a previous tenant which seemed like a very weak excuse as I had already given meter readings and my name and therefore should have nothing to do with a previous tenant. On In top of this they gave me 3 different prices for my 'standing daily charge' which felt like they were just feeding me anything to try to appease me. My meter is also totting up ten pence per minute when the electricity to the flat is switched off at the fuse box, so it appears I may be getting charged upto 4.80 per day with the electricity turned off! Will definately change suppliers and would advise people to avoid this company at all costs! 
190|When we first started with npower they did not charge us at all for gas for six months so we ran in ti debt that we paid of monthly on top of the bill. When the debt was clerared they refused to adjust the repayment (direct debit) sufficiently so we accrued over GBP500 credit over a period of time. We have now changed supplier and npower will not pay back our credit. This seems to be a standard practice for this most unscrupulous energy provider. Avoid at all cost.
191|Received a letter in December saying I was 361.71 in credit on the electricity account... Final Bill. They did not send me a Final Bill for the gas, I expect this also to be in credit.Now in February they claim they are waiting on Transco. The new supplier has the new reading but NPOWER claim they did not receive it from Transco. Transco have 40 days to supply this reading and then NPOWER are obliged to contact them. 40 days had long passed and they did not contact them. They also blame a changeover of billing systems.Do not use this company there customer service is polite but shoddy. Even so i was reduced to saying what they were telling me was utter bull.I will now have to contact transco and watchdog as waiting another 4 weeks until i can validly contact NPOWER again is not good enough.
192|I've been with NPower since May 2011.They seemed OK up until they put their prices up in December and so I moved providers. By then my account was GBP500 in credit (they kept putting up my direct debit payments without warning but that is another story). I applied to have this returned to me and kept being given excuse after excuse why I couldn't.Now it is February 2013 and it looks like I'll have to take them to court to get it returned. So far I've made THREE official complaints against them which have been 'lost' on their computer system or completely ignored. My advice is to AVOID them at all costs. They are quick to take, take, take your money and when it comes to returning it they'll avoid it like the plague. 
193|"Background: Became a customer of Npower 3 years ago, had a dual/economy 7 rate meter asked for it to be changed to a single rate unit, three failed visits by Npower to change the unit (no explanation provided). Executive complaints team keep ""closing"" calls dispite the matter remainging open, and there being outstanding questions. Then three years later an un-announced visit to change the meter, but this time for another dual rate meter - no one at Npower reads the notes on the account, loads of appologies and disgust that the matter is still un resolved over three years - but no one takes responsibility, they fail to tell me how Im being billed, they fail to issue a deadlock letter - only way I prompted action was to cc in the RWE/Npower management team (I would recommend it to anyone - it gets some results)... matter still open and unresolved and awaiting NPower's response! "
194|We have been with nPower for quite a number of years, and have had nothing but problems with them. Initially they were poor at the basics, such as giving us accurate bills. But over the last couple of years they have seemingly been making up whatever amounts they feel fit to charge us.After having had a rebate given to us in 2010, and a subsequent meter change, nPower have decided that our power usage has increased by around 3-4 times, this despite us not using much more, if any, energy. And over the last 12 months we have been in dispute with them because of this, and despite having complained numerous times we have made little progress with them.Each time we contact nPower we seem to get a different version of the story from them. Some advisers seem to agree with us that we are paying way over the odds for our energy, others seem to think that it's about right. And every time we contact them the amount we owe changes by an amount that none of their advisers are able or willing to explain. The only consistent factor is that the outstanding amount they claim we owe increases by far more than the amount we believe we are using.To add insult to injury, nPower have now admitted that the aforementioned rebate in 2010 was a mistake because it was based on an estimated reading, despite the fact that it was based on an actual reading by a MeterPlus employee. Worse still is the fact that they have been quietly taking back that money without our knowledge, this only being admitted recently having complained about our charges being far too high again. We are still engaged in trying to sort this matter out, but despite dozens of calls & a lot of stress we have yet to reach a satisfactory conclusion.So in short, unless you enjoy being charged over the odds, and sometimes charged random unexplained amounts & love the thrill of terrible inconstant customer service, I would urge you to avoid this calamity of an energy provider.
195|I switched providers to this company through the MoneySupermarket.com website in November. After a month, I still hadn't heard anything from Npower to called MoneySupermarket to explain this. I felt that MoneySupermarket fobbed me off as they told me to call Npower direct. I was told that there was a computer problem and I would hear again in the next few days.1 week on and I had heard nothing. I called and cancelled my account and switched to Sainsbury's (I think they use British Gas). My switch with them went ahead.3 weeks later and I get a letter from Npower advising they are switching me, despite me cancelling the request in writing. All sorted now, but a massive headache and they were totally useless!

197|"DON""T USE THIS COMPANY. I left Npower in October and since then have spent 3 months trying to get them to credit back GBP101 owed to me. Their letter stated any credit would be refunded 30 days from the date of the final bill. The final bill appeared after phone call number 1, this bill was dated 5 Dec 2012 and came after christmas with a letter dated 19 December. No matter, 30 days later I would get a refund, oh no, after another call 3 January 2013 was told 5-7 days. After phoning again today, 30 January was told 7-10 days. After complaining I was told 'an email had gone to the Refunds Department on 3 December and no-one can contact them and they are very busy' Appalling! The complaints department weren't taking any calls and I had to practically force the girl on the phone to send another email to the Refunds Department. I am currently waiting for contact from the complaints department but will be taking this to the ombudsman.Read more: http://reviews.money.co.uk/review/102918-npower-is-a-really-poor-company.htm#ixzz2JUOAVsS0"
198|I left npower partly because I could get a better deal elsewhere but mainly because of their bad customer service. When I saw that my payments were not covering my usage I phoned them to ask them to review my payment plan. This they said they could not do as they could only review usage every six months and a review would not be made for another few months. I explained that I would be further in debt to them by then. This made absolutely no difference to their inflexible system. They should realise that if customers payments are falling behind in the summer months they will be in even more debt to them come winter.When I transfered to my new supplier I was in GBP218 in debt to npower. I was told that they could give me a payment plan to settle this debt and would contact me in due course. This did not happen, they just took the money out of my bank account without any warning. This caused me considerable hardship as I am on a pension. I personally believe that they allow customers to get into arrears with them to deter them from leaving.    
199|We moved to nPower from British Gas thinking that most suppliers are the same, we are on a pre payment meter.So they have switched us over and not sent us any communication to say this, our gas had to be put on the emergency tariff at 7am.I had to call British Gas to find out why the BG top up card would not work, and it was only at this point I found out we are now supplied by nPower (or not) So I get home from work and call npower, the guy gives me a code to take to a shop about 2 miles away from my home (how nice) tells me I can't go there until after 19:30.Shop people very helpful but the code is no good they cannot activate a new card for me, so I call npower and get through to a very abrupt woman demanding to know the reason I need a new card.I tell the abrupt lady that they have never supplied me with a card even though they are supposed to be supplying me with gas, then she puts me on hold for 10 minutes to find out why the code is not working.She comes back on the phone to tell me that there is an error with the code and she could send me one in the post within 7 days!!!So I let her know how disappointed I am with their total lack of help considering the gas credit has almost run out so she tells me she can supply a new code to me but I won't be able to use it until after 10:30 in the morning.I tell her not good enough, we have a small child and its freezing out she then goes on to tell me that I should call the gas emergency line when the credit runs out.Anyway I'm bored of thinking about this ridiculous company and it's dimwit employee's.You might pay a bit more for other suppliers, but from my experience now, it is probably worth it.To all the npower call centre employees who I had the misfortune to contact, thanks for your lack of help. 
200|I have just moved into my house and the previous tenants were with npower so i thought to save hassle, i would just stay with them. I have been trying to ring them for the past 3 days to give my readings and say we have moved but in but still no luck!
201|"No hot water - so we phone NPower, as we've - stupidly - signed up to their homecare service. The fault is diagnosed, and it turns out we needed a new diverter valve. Fair enough, GBP218 later and we have an appointment between 8 and 12 midday. Only 2 days without hot water - we'll survive. NPower then cancel the appointment and re-arrange for 5 days later.They then come round, fit the diverter valve, and realise this hasnt fixed the problem. ""Oh, its the heating plate - that'll be another GBP288 please"". Rubbish.So they wrongly diagnosed the problem, replaced a part that clearly didn't need replacing, and now want more money.We're cancelling and going to British Gas."
202|They failed to set up DD the first time,  gave them bank details again!  I knew they had my correct details as they took out a lump sum which I checked a week later on my bank statement. After several months I then realised that they had not been taking any money out monthly! Rang them in a panick and set up a Dd for GBP200 a month to try and catch up with payments and also asked for a customer call back - I never got a call back. I also gave them meter readings, which I realised I had never been asked for since switching to DD! Sent an email saying how disappointed I was with their whole system and that due to their failures I had been left in Debt. I received a letter then saying that after calculating my meter readings, my DD does not cover the new amount owing so the DD have been suspended until the outstanding bill amount of over GBP1500.00 is paid off! The letters that followed after my complaint letter from the so called Customer services department, were all, I feel, saying that it was mainly my fault and that this all could of been avoided if I had checked my bank account! I pay all my bills by DD, Npower are the ONLY company that have failed to set up a DD, and they didn't fail once but twice. Their last letter is saying that their final outcome is to take 10% of my outstanding balance as a goodwill gesture and to let me pay the remainder off over a 12 month period. Also in this letter they have stated that if I don't set up a DD within 10 working days, they will send the DEBT COLLECTORS round! Scare mongering is not the way to help customers!they also told me that the ombudsman do not like people who stop paying whilst a complaint is being dealt with? THEY CANCELLED IT!As soon as it is all paid off, I will switch suppliers as Npowers charges are disgraceful! And their complaints handling team are as unpolite and about as useful as a glass hammer!
203|My mum who is an OAP stupidly signed up with Npower for gas when a sales person came to her door.She has had nothing but problems, They say she owes 2500 pound to them but her gas is on pre-payment so never tops it up due to not needing gas.The flat is council owned so gas is serviced by them but Npower insist on letting their own company to come and service everything breaking in to her flat when she is out etc.We are now taking legal action against them in a Scottish court for harassment and breach of contract.Would give them 0 stars if i could.
204|I signed up with N_Power 'GoFix8' Jan 2012 and apart from not taking their first direct debit at all, they provided complaint-free service until Nov 2012; at this point, the ability to take the same amount of money from my account as they promised, disappeared, and because they took GBP50 too little, they then indicated they wished to increase my monthly payments by GBP31 per month to GBP116Dec 2012; After much discourteous (and some courteous) negotiation (depending on who answered the phone) AND a payment of the missing GBP50, we agreed to put the direct debit back to its original value GBP85.Tues 08/01/2013 they sent an email confirming this.Today 09/01/2013 they took GBP135.00In addition to this, it is an added frustration to find out about their ability limited ability to receive any complaint.  It would be hard to create a more protracted rigamarole with which to discourage customer complaint - despite a very contrary and well displayed set of slogans on there web page.  If all you require is a notification of receipt, then emailing N_power will be for you.  Should actually be lucky and get a reply do not presume you now have an email contact... no its just one of those useless 'no-reply' affairs which now plague too many paying customers; any further comment by you will need to be initiated online using their 'Complaints form'.It will be at this point you realise their ability to deal with any complaint is even worse than their ability to receive it.
205|"We called the engineer as we had a small leek from the boiler, the heating and the hot water was fine working perfectly well. Engineer inspects the boiler and leaves. Now we have no heating and no hot water, and water dripping rapidly out of the boiler and also no water coming out if the hot tap. Explanation from Npower "" The boiler needs replacing so they won't repair it so no heating or hot water until we can afford to buy one even though it was working perfectly before he arrived. I moved from British Gas as Npower was cheaper WHAT A MISTAKE YOU DEFINATLY GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!! Worst customer service I have ever known !!! So single parent with 2 young children now without no heating or hot water !"
206|The customer services dept sought to involve my wife & I in a rather silly state of affairs regarding our electricity readings in Sept of last year. The simple solution to the problem was to change the meter because the accuracy of the unit was being affected by a solar panel system we had invested in some 10 months previously. However the dept thought it necessary to send us a series of rather ambiguous letters suggesting we could owe the company several thousands of pounds for supply!. It took the best part of three months for the penny to finally drop but they still had to have three go's before the meter was changed. In our case it was very difficult to get any legible reply from the dept either by telephone or by writing to their Peterlee address & we finished up having to make a complaint. The dept's billing has also become erratic, we have not received a statement since last July.   
207|I attempted changing over to nPower at the end of August. Their communication is appauling. They tell you nothing. They just came up with a Monthly figure which was way too high  and expected me to allow them to take it from my account by Direct Debit.Their complaints Department haven't bothered to respond for over a month. When I spoke to them about their failings they said they are having a LOT of problems!!!!!! Please think twice before signing up to them. I have gone back to Scottish Power and am saving GBP20 per month. Why I ever thought of leaving them I now wonder.Just be warned.
208|We moved out of the property back in may 2012. Call them around 5 times before they've managed to send a final bill to my new address. 6 months later they send me a new bill with an extra admin charge because they had to track me down!Apparently, they have only closed a gas account, but not an electricity one.Since then (early December) I call them weekly asking to take the admin charge off and re-send the bill.3 times they apologized to me, because it is their error and 3 times new bill was promised. I've got a letter from their debt collection services this morning.still on-going..never ever would I recommend npower to anyone.a/n 37364926
209|I have been with Npower for gas and electricity only 6 months while renting a one bedroom flat. I am horrified how unlawful this company is.I was given no choice or explanation on the energy tarriffs and they repeatedly refused to take any meter readings into accounts on a 6 month period, ignored all my queries and kept charging me for overpriced estimate energy use. When they increased their prices in November 2012, they didn't send any bill and tried to backbill me with the new tarriffs for a 6 month period for both gas and electricity, when I said I was moving out and asked for a final bill.I have written about 5 complaint letters to their management saying I would take them to Court if not getting a deadlock letter and detailed bills for my energy use, I have received an inaccurate final bill for electricity only,which is still on higher estimates despite accurate meter readings given before the energy price increase and at the time of moving out. I am unemployed, but 226GBP in credit and closed my Npower account a month ago and yet the money is not coming back. I keep getting letters at my new address asking me for meter readings as if it was never provided. If you want a friendly advice, avoid them like the plague and take them to Energy Ombudsman and write to Ofgem dorectly if you are facing a dispute to denounce their sick methods. They will never resolve your complaint unless threatened to be taken to Court. This is a complete outrage and disgrace.
210|How can his company justify a bill increase by twice the usual amount when there was no significant changes to the overall energy consumption? A dd for GBP62 suddenly went to GBP129? On receipt of a statement that read 'for information only' I called the company to discuss the changes. I asked what had caused this significant change and it was confirmed that there was a price increase in Nov 2012. Even with a price increase, it does not justify why my dd is a GBP129. I got disconnected a few times and none of the agents had the curtsy to call me back even though they verified my telephone number at the first point of contact. It would appear that their August Saver 2013 tariff is a ripoff. The refund of GBP100 expected will be debited via dd way before I even receive the refund. After reading previous review, it appears that unjustifiable dd increase and poor customer service is a common practice for this company. Something needs to be done about companies like these and there should be more protection available for innocent customers like myself. 
211|As a young couple we've been with npower since we moved into our new property 3 years ago. In that 3 years we've had nothing but problems. To begin with, we were paying GBP80.00 a month by direct debit. We then rang to give meter readings and it went up to GBP90.00 (which is acceptable) then I received a letter to say the payments would be going up to GBP180.00 a month. Now, bearing in mind we both worked full time and the highest payment was for gas which we seldom used as we hardly use central heating, this seemed extremely expensive. I rang them and again gave meter readings and was told that there had been an error at their end and someone had keyed in a 3 instead of a 1 at the start of our gas reading so we were infact in credit by GBP500. As we were in credit the payments were then lowered to just GBP18.00 a month, this stayed the same for around 12 months, during which time I received statements to say that the figure was still correct. Around 4 weeks ago I rang npower to say that I wanted to put my payments up as its becoming winter and I'm also on maternity leave with a 6 month old baby so therefore will be using more energy. I was told this was fine but I needed to give meter readings (although in the same sentence was told someone had come out 2months earlier and done them???). So anyway, fast forward 3 weeks and I received 2 letters on the same day (dated 3 days apart) one to state our new payments are GBP170.00 a month and another one to say they have no meter readings from us.....this obviously doesn't add up, I was previously told that they have meter readings and that my payments had recently been reviewed and were correct and yet I was still hit with a ridiculous monthly bill!! When I rang npower to question the new amount I was told by the girl on the phone that all accounts are reviewed every 6 months and for some reason mine obviously hadn't but she had no idea why? (helpful...thanks love). After going through to a manager and asking why our account hadn't been reviewed I was simply told 'well we never guarantee it!', I'm now having to pay GBP120.00 a month direct debit....npower- zero customer service, and couldn't care less how much they land their customers in it!!Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!
212|Npower  has been supplying my electric since I've moved into my house three and half years ago,the bills have never been regular or on time but recently I received a bill two days after it should of been paid so I phoned the customer service who said they couldn't do anything about it and just pay asap I explained this is your error not mine.i paid the bill but again the next bill came on the friday and needed to be paid by the Tuesday,the meter was read two weeks before by npower so why leave sending my bill so long,I've wrote to them and waiting to hear.
213|npower today sent letter informing me my d / d is to increase by GBP18 a month i am GBP177 in credit and this will cover my winter bill . they did this last year and there is no reasoning with them how can i change supplier when they owe me GBP177 ?i already pay d/d GBP66 per month they are telling me that this winter my bill will be higher . what can i do ? i asked to speak to a manager and was told to busy , been with them 4 years but will leave .
214|I have been trying to move supply from a pre-payment meter for 2.5 months with various telephone calls giving me a date of move.  This date always arrives and NOTHING.  I have told them where to shove it now.  Please do not pay them a penny.
215|"Whilst I agree that the energy market is broken and non-transparent - I must admit that IF you keep your wits about you then NPower can offer a good deal (or should I say competative).  But from my experience of contacting Customer Services AND Complaining online - it is a complete waste of time.  Apart from the automated ""We try to provide a next working day response to enquiries. "" I've been waiting 12 days for a response to a customer services online form and 5 days for an online complaint.When I telephoned them it was sorted out immediatelySo, the message is ignore the talk of 21st century working - NPower are nowhere near yet - always phone them."
216|I´m with npower for quite a while now. Recently, I found out that they charged me more than 2000KW too much within 5 months!! I complained a few times to them but never received a response. Of course I didn´t pay it because on the meter there is proof that I didn´t use what they are charging on my last bill. They are very persistent in ignoring me, but quick in adding fees. Well, I don´t pay what I don´t owe them. I also updated the meter reading on my account with the correct number and told them to come and see for themselves. Again, no answer. But they passed it onto a debt collection agency wich is sending me nasty letters.Since a lot of people are having exactly the same experience with shocking high bills, all created within the last few months, I´m starting to think that they are fully aware that they are charging their customers too much and hope that with ignoring complaints or sending scary letters, people will just pay. I think there is a name for this kind of behaviour, it´s called FRAUD, and usually its unlawful and people go to prison for that. Some people here suggested to go to the Media. I think thats a very good idea. I´ve already reported it to BBC Watchdog but I think if more people would do that, they would be forced to investigate and find out whats actually going on here.My advice, stay away from npower. Every other supplier is much better and cheaper. I will do the same and change asap. Bye bye npower, you are the worst company in the whole country. By the way, I only gave on point because I had to, it´s not possible to give zero points.
217|I recently changed supplier to Npower. They set up my direct debit incorrectly, I tried to call to sort out and their waiting time was over 45 mins. Even if you hang on the phone that long they don't answer. I tried requesting a call back, again no call back. I have also tried using the weblink on their own website. I received automated responses saying they would reply in a few days but a week later they still have not replied. These people have the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
218|We moved into our house 3 months ago which was already supplied by NPower - we have tried very hard to swap to another supplier only to get objections sent every time. Initially we were told it would take 30 days to set up an account and send our final bill - lifting any objections, when that did not arrive they told us it was going to be a further 40-60 days.. Still no bill, still getting objections. From the reviews above i'm guessing its going to be whatever price that suits them. They have us right where they want us / with absolutely no option for us to move supplier and 90days  worth of bill on whatever tariff they want. They are uninformed on the phone with no continuity between conversations they have had with you previously. Normally I would try and find something positive to say in their defence - But I can't think of anything. I'll get back to you in 90 days....
219|GBP50 in credit and they take a direct debit of GBP158. Despite the fact the direct debit was set up for GBP88. There was no indication they would increase the direct debit they just did. Am moving suppliers and will be writing a letter to ofgem about this. This practice can not be allowed to continue.
220|Recommended by u-switch, n-power would save me GBP180 a year they said. Yep cheers for that one u-switch! Monthly direct debits were half the cost of what i was paying with British gas, asked if I was paying enough, wait for the 6 month review,they replied.   I couldn't even check my bill online, they wouldn't and couldn't tell me my bill, then I decided to move house.  I VERY quickly received my final bill..... of over GBP680!!!Moved house but its got meters in it. Now trying to pay off my bill and current use on meter.  Asked them on 7 separate occasion to send me payment cards to my current address as they refused to take direct debits and they sent them to my previous address, yes you guessed it 7 times.  Complete planks.
221|I recieved a letter dated 12th October, advising of an increase due to my tariff expiring on 6th November.  On checking comparison websites I found a cheaper deal, from NPOWER.I decided to email after I made numerous calls where I was placed in a queue where wait time were as high as 45 minutes.  I then made the decision to email as I have an online account, thought that this would be easier.Email was sent on 20th October and still have not recieved a reply.  Got through on the phone today after 10 minute wait on the phone, only to be told that systems were down and no account details could be accessed.  I made my complaint verbally and was reasurred that the email would be answered, but it was acknowledged that NPOWER were around three weeks behind in getting back to consumers.I reitterated that this was not acceptable, and the customer service advisor agreed. Where do you go from there?
222|I thought NPower were the usual rip off power supplier, until I wanted to move.  Had quite a lot to sort out, as was moving, rang the npower moving line and was held, waiting for hours.  The movers will be here in the morning, I don't have time for this, how is it going to be possible to get gas & power in my new place?  Ridiculous, don't go near.
223|I spoke to an advisor on the 18th October regarding changing my tariff, and was told that, due to all customers being transferred to a new computer system they were unable to help, however, promised to book a 'call back' on a date convenient to myself - this call never arrived. I wrote a short email of complaint on the 27th October and still there is no reply in my inbox :-(Unfortunately I have been trying to contact a human being since the 25th October and have had no joy - the answering service tells me they are experiencing 'high volume of calls' and to expect the waiting time to be over 45 mins!!! Fingers crossed the automated call-back system will work today, although I am not feeling very positive. I wonder if the Npower Customer Services Team are tasked with looking at these review/forums?  Although, as I dont see any responses - obviously not.
224|No reminders to read meter and only 6 monthly read anyway, initial monthly payment set too low, now accrued GBP300 debt and monthly charges increased by 400%.Move again in February to another rip off electric company - they make vast profits and offer no customer service at all.
225|I became Npower after finding this company is giving the best rate on energy prices. I have to say how I regret that decision. I've used 5 providers and 2 of them were really bad: Spark and Npower. It started with having issues on getting my bills. They have really bad online system. If you opt for paper bill, then you cant get the online bill, which was apparently more up to date. I eventually opted for online bill and guess what, it was also very late! I can't even see how much the cost of my bill in every month until the bill produced every 6 months. Well, if you think its annyoing enough. Guess what, my problem is still haven't finished. Since my usage is very low, i build up some credits on my account. Npower then keep sending me leters asking me to send meter reading again (bear in mind that I always provide meter reading every month already!). Now when I moved out from the old apartment, I still cant get my credit back. And to make it worse, they even erase my online account. So there is no final bill, no evidence on the paper showing my credit, and now they wipe out the last evidence on the online account. How wonderful!!Unfortunately My problem is not over, when I moved into the new house, they said that they will give me GBP100 if I stay with them. That was a lie, it turned out that GBP100 is the reward if I setup direct debit! Now I have 2 outstanding complaints which takes 30 days to progress. When I ask them what they want to do with that 30 days? they got the last meter reading, they got my account details, they know that I have credit, then why they need 30 days to refund my money. They just said it is how its done. My advise, pick the 2nd best. Avoid Npower and spark. I've used Atlantic, SSE, and Npower - all of them can give you good price but no headache like this. 
226|"I have been with N-power for over a year and haven't been impressed.  They only provide bills every 6 months.  After my first 6 months they wanted to halve my direct debit even though I was paying the right amount to cover my consumption.I have moved now to Scottish Power on a fixed rate as N-powers prices are going up.  My main gripe is my final bill is inaccurate and doesn't even have my electricity consumption on it.  So I am GBP90 in credit but have been supplied with a cryptic online ""energy"" bill that says my account balance is GBP0.00, it only lists my gas account.  I emailed them but received no response within the maximum 5 days that they say they will take to reply.  I phoned on to find out where my final electricity bill was and, more importantly, where my GBP90 was.  I was assured that it would be paid into my account yesterday and that the bill would be uploaded to view on line.  It is not on-line and no money has been repaid.  Very poor customer service and their accounts system is bordering on fraudulent as they have said that my account balance is GBP0 when in fact they owe me GBP90."
227|I did leave E.O.N only a month ago and joined NPOWER with a promise that the plan I will be on until November 2013! with less then 4 weeks NPOWER sent me a letter about there prices are going up!  Is that a joke ? 
228|Npower was recommended by a broker .Energy brokers are the problem and not the solution. There is no proper way to compare prices. Energy prices should be clearly displayed by all suppliers . It is impossible to make an informed choice. Most importantly, Buyer beware because there is no cooling off period for business. The market is shamefull and an embarrassment to Britain .
229|I worked as an advisor for the company ,they treat the workers really bad and invent procedures and criticise constantly , every call i took the customer was delighted on the work i carried out and i explained the process in detail .The Manager of the Complex needs replacing , bullying , harrasment and victimisation is rife 
230|I've just left npower after one year. I was kept completely in the dark about my gas and electricity usage. The online facility to view bills didn't work; my phone calls to npower took ages to be answered and then the information was not available or my meter readings were lost. I didn't have a bill in over a year until I changed supplier. I then only got a reconciliation bill after I rang for one. I was lucky that I was in credit. My sister in law had the same experience and has received a bill for nearly GBP500 having suffered the same lack of information. Never again! 
231|I have just had my six monthly statement.  They want me to increase my direct debit from GBP55 to GBP118 a month!  This is for a small flat.  I said I would not and could not increase my payment.  I am GBP32 in credit and have never owed them a penny.  The person I spoke to told me 'you can't expect to get your electricity and gas free', so rude and patronising.  I said I would cancel my direct debit, she said 'I don't advise you to do that'.  I have made a formal, written complaint, which I will take to Ofgem if necessary.  I know perfectly well that they like everyone to pay in advance so that they can then get interest on that money.  Everyone should be aware of this trick and refuse to do it.  I shall safe the same amount I pay now into a savings account and use it to pay my next bill but shall be looking to move to another energy provider
232|This company is beyond belief.  They started my account off on more than my reading and I gave them several readings and they still ignored them.  Ended up owing me well over GBP200.  I changed my direct debit with them, then they didn't initiate it.  I have today rung them to be told they that have no record of setting my direct debit and I have now got to give them more readings (2 weeks after giving them up to date readings) to be able to set it.  When my contract is up I'm out of there......absolutely rubbish rubbish company. 
233|"I've always been a customer of British gas, but people where saying there might be a better deal elsewhere, so I started looking around but never really did anything else about it. One day the door knocked and it was npower telling me all abou there offers and where telling me how I would save GBP300 a year, well I thought we're struggling for cash anyways so obviously I was hooked in, signed the contract I would get my bill every 3 months and signed for direct debit and couldn't wait to have cheaper bill.Well only a month later and I had already got my bill so I quickly opened it and I was shocked GBP719, I couldn't believe it I only ever used to pay GBP90 for gas and elec. As if I thought so I rang them explained I have never had a bill come to that much, the woman was saying well its definitely your bill u gave us the meter reading ( I so did not, they took it when I signed the contract but silly me forgot to check it), I kept trying to explain to her that there must be a mistake, she kept telling me no there's no mistake, that is the amount. Now I'm stuck with a payment plan I can't afford, they sent me nasty letters, they also said if I didn't pay they would fit a pre payment meter and I would have no say in the matter, I definitely don't want one if them they would probably get that wrong aswel and charge me 10x extra. I had to move the date of the due payment and its only the first time I've done it and the woman on the phone said u can't keep changing the dates I got angry and said just be glad your getting a payment. I am now stuck until I am debt free then I will move back to the much trusted British gas.To sum it all up they don't care for the customer, all they care about is trying to rip people off, nasty letters, horri or customer service.I should've listen when people say ""if its too good to be true, it probably is"""
234|Joined Npower when I moved house in February 2012.  Paying by direct debit each month.  Just received a bill today stating that my direct debit payments have to increase from GBP75 per month  to GBP360 per month or pay GBP618 in 10 days. I have only been in the house since February.  They have read my meter twice since I have moved and I had this letter today.  Never have I had to pay GBP360 per month for energy.  In my last house I was with Scottish Power for 10 years and they were great.  But since I moved I though I would stay with what the previous owner had.  I am switching and going back to Scottish Power.  Keep away from these bunch of crooks.
235|stay away from them an if your with them leave now before its to late,they conned me into joining them with a cheaper monthly payment only to turn round 8 months later an say i owed them more than i pay in a year an ther is nothing i can do about it.i have been to the ombadsman an even they cant help me.i dnt know how this is even legal.now they are threatening court action and bailiffs.n-power are the worst company ever ripping off young familys.i am so dissapointed this can be allowed to happen in this country.please stay away.i wish i read these reviews before i joined.
236|I moved from Scottish Power after their prices went up. The alarm bells should have been ringing on the start up with N Power, took two months of hassle and phone calls just to get the duel fuel accounts right.They gave me GBP50.00 for the trouble I had. Now a year later, they want double the monthly direct debit as the price has gone up,(through the roof I think)I have gone back to Scottish Power, but still weeks afer closing the N Power account, they cannot get the final bill sorted.When I phoned, I get passed around, the phone either put down on me or cut off.Grrrrr Stay away people.Read the reviews.
237|I'm been chasing nPower for 10 months about the same problem. I speak to a new representative everytime I phone, who assure me they will look into the problem as a matter of urgency and PROMISE to phone me back but, it NEVER happens. They are a absolute disgrace of a company. I've never been treated so badly in my life by a business! I've filed a formal complaint against them but, nothing ever gets resolved. I'm cancelling my direct debit and changing suppliers pronto, I can no longer spend anymore time phoning thier useless customer service representative. Please, for the love of God, avoid this company. Dealing with them, as been the number 1 worst customer service experience of my life. Looking at the other reviews on this website, its clear I'm not alone. Complete disgrace.
238|We moved to our current address on 21 June and informed NPOWER who were the previous occupants supplier the meter reading. Thinking it would be easier to remain with them we attempted to start a new contract. We have been told so many times, Im sorry but it was an error on the system. Guess what, there will be an error on my systems when they want the bill paid. Nearly 3 months and numerous phone calls later, we have yet to receive a contract or even get a call returned. It seems to me that such a shocking company would want new custom but no. Thank the lord we didn't get hooked into them.Bye Bye NPOWER.
239|Npower are awful when considering communication.When I initially set up my account/direct debit, despite the fact that the employee spelt my name correct on the account - they spelt it incorrect on the direct debit application! So of course the bank declined it. Did they call me? No, sent a letter two weeks later! So I called up, corrected the spelling, and again the employee put their intelligence to good use and completely changed the name on the account - literally from Clare to Amanda? So again, the direct debit was decline. Upon the third time of contacting them to rectify their mistake, I was informed that the system was down and that I should attempt to call back in 2-3 days. Ridiculous. You are on hold for at least 10 minutes before you hear something that is not an automated response. The iPhone app did not work. Over all, if it is a difference of a couple quid bite the bullet and avoid the necessary stress that Npower will provide.
240|We left British Gas on the proviso that npower would be cheaper. One month in they upped us to the more expensive tariff without telling us then a few months later they hit us with an extortionate bill. On a number of occassions I would phone up to try and sort this out - the staff on the phone were severely lacking knowledge and would just pass me around from person to person, each time me having to explain why I had called. Over several phone calls (each with an average wait time of over 20 minutes) the problem was still not sorted. It was very frustrating. The customer service is appalling - rather than call me to discuss increased payments they just send you a letter demanding an excessive amount of money (nearly three times what British Gas were charging). DO NOT use this awful company. The customer service at British Gas is far superior and they always communicate to you any changes in the amount of gas and elec you are using. 
241|My complaints with Npower are endless. They have not only overbilled us where after a loooooong and lengthy complaint was this resolved with a 'good will gesture' of over GBP900...which questions the validity of their initial bill.If you have any sense please avoid them!!!!Currently in the process of changing suppliers BUT who to choose????It seems like most gas and electricity company keep messing customers around!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!
242|Npower are absolutely dreadful! For four months they managed to not take my direct debit despite repeated and lenghty telephone calls to them providing them with my bank details(which they already had but somehow lost!). I then receive an uncessarily complicated bill today which makes no sense at all with two different balances. On contacting customer services they accept that the bill is wrong but say I have to pay the higher amount. I tell them I wish to lodge a complaint, they leave me on hold for 20 minutes before advising me that they've got it wrong and I should pay the smaller balance. 
243|We have been with NPower for 5 years they frequently go into our account and take what ever they want without even notifying us that our payment is going to be increased. we have paid almost GBP3,000 in the last year for electricity and gas and they are telling me that we still owe money. We have been paying GBP240 per month for the last four months so i cancelled our next Direct debit and they inform me that they were going to take GBP400 this month, we only have a 3 bedroom house and we are both at work all day. I really am puzzled and wondering if we are paying somebody elses bill.I really need some advice as to where i can get help and check the metres as this is stressing us so much.We have spoken to our neighbours who all pay approximately GBP150 - GBP170 per month.Please help!! We dont know what to do.
244|"3rd night in a row I've phoned npower for some simple details, I wanted to know my annual electricity usage. 3rd night in a row I've been told ""Unfortunately our systems are down, if I take your number someone will call you back tomorrow"". I waited for a call Tuesday and Wednesday, NOBODY CALLED!I need to know my elecy usage NOW you muppets.When I asked the support op if this is a strategy, that npower do in the last 30-60 minutes of the day she answered a categoric 'YES'. Doesn't help me as its the only hour I get to ring out.Bye npower, I'm gone!"
245|Avoid them, GBP180 credit due to me and have to wait up to 40 days
246|This is more of a question than a review. I had a british gas pre payment meter and i cleared the debt but there was a big issue with it and they mistakenly added the debt as credit so i had 900 pound credit if i use that do i owe it back as it was their mistake?
247|If i actually wrote down all the problems i have had with this company in just over a year that i used them as my energy supplier,it would just take too long!All i will say is that they are totally incompetent and a rip off,i only wish i had read all the reviews on here before putting myself through untold stress and now debt through no fault of my own!
248|Npower advised us our direct debit wil be set when we joined. After 6 months , we rang up as students advising whether our summer period bills will be reduced as we won't be there. We were then advised we were 800 in debit even though we had paid almost  GBP780 for the last 7 months we were with them.  That's about GBP1500 in 7 months.Then told my bill went up by GBP250 in 3 weeks even though I was away and my boiler had broken down 2 weeks before I went away. I asked how that came about and was advised I had given a meter reading through someone who called in. No security checks were done before details of my account was discussed with whomever this person who rang in is. My address, everything. No bills are sent, the online bills are useless, never updated and they even have the wrong name on my account online. I've told them I am not a mr smith. I'm a miss a...and yet it remains unchanged. It beggars belief they're still in business and reading all the reviews, one  can see a common thread of lies and deceit. Wish I never joined them. Moving back to halls of residence coz I've lost faith in the whole bill paying thing.
249|Just about as low as you can go for a major national company. Npower screwed us at every step of our short honeymoon period.1st their salespeople lied to us to get us into signing with them. Eventually got that reversed at great personal expense and effort... as usual.Consistently doubled our estimated bills despite regular low usage.Sent us threat of legal action letter 7 days after issuing invoice! What's all that about. No reminder, nothing.Finally lied to us about our final bill. Said they had read the meter and the usage what XXX when they simply hadn't and it was about 1/3 of that amount. 1 after month leaving we got a threat letter from DCA for GBP19.78. They say it was for late payment admin fee.The mind boggles.Suffice it to say, I ain't paying! This will be the longest, most expensive  GBP19.78 that they will ever pursue.
250|Well i dont know where to start with this shambolic company . First of you take money out of my account without letting me know and then put my bank into overdraft , Then when i ring up to sort out another billing problem ,I had one of your representatives say we owe 600 and my partner was on the phone to another Representative at the same time and they were saying we owe 250 ????? so do you make these figures up? then only recently we set up a direct debit with you again for 104pound a month to pay to n power for you to TAKE 294pound instead ?????? I have the letter at home to say 104pound would be took .Then when I rang up ,I had one of your representatives say that I arranged that ??? But when i was put through to management they finally admitted  it was wrong and they would credit my account but this ruined my bank holiday as again it left my bank with overdraft problems again. This made me and my partner argue yet again so thank you n power for such a wonderful customer experience.
251|1. They got my initial postal address wrong!2. They then took 3 months after me opening an account to actually start our account. (You would think they'd want our business... obviously not... they are completely inept).3. They then charged us FAR too high an amount almost three times the rate it should be based on our usage.4. The online account system does not have our energy account registered. I tried registering it, only to be told that there is a 'problem' in that my account doesn't exist... even though they have sent me a letter confirming this account!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have just complained, but if they are anything like British Gas it will take me about 8 times (no exaggeration) to get this sorted. At least British Gas paid me compensation for their ineptitude!!The problem is that ALL the companies in Britain suck these days. None of them care about the customer, only their profits. Just like the political parties they are all useless and corrupt.I'd love to recommend another company, however you are in a bad luck situation I'm afraid because the UK is rubbish!
252|This company is far the worst in the UK they rip you off I provided a meter reading and they were unbale to tell me the amount of my bill. MY ADVISE DONT TOUCH THEM WITH A BARGE POLE THEY ARE WORSE THAN BRITISH GAS AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NIL STAFF ARGUE WITH YOU 
253|Reading below reviews and we could all be the same person!Received a statement in August 2010 advising we were over GBP400 in credit and that NPower would reduce our direct debit to take this into account.  Received a further statement in February 2011 we were then GBP90 in debt, however the direct debit did not need to be increased.  August statement received advising GBP110 debt but once again direct debit did not need to be increased. February 2012 we are now GBP500 in debt and they want direct debit to increase by over 3 times what we were originally paying. Called Npower who agreed that they should have assessed the account and increased the direct debit amounts in both February and August (this was after speaking to a number of operators who could not understand what my issue was????. Advised to cancel direct debit (member of staff) and they would look into the problem and call back on a specific day/time. Guess what this didnt happen and I had to call them again.  I have written numerous letters and emails (no response other than automatic we have received and will respond in 7 working days.  Received a phone call chasing payment and the above was explained to the employee last Thursday - promised they would look into it all and resolve it - and would contact me by close of business Monday 14th May.  GUESS WHAT ..... Still awaiting the reply :(
254|I have been with npower for Gas & Elec. for a number of years and was reasonably happy with the cost. At the beginning of 2011 I also took up their Homecare 50 plan.The engineer (Donnellys East Kilbride) has been out for the annual sevice on 23/03/2012 and as far as I am concerned there was no problem. I specifically asked him if everything was okay and he said it was.On 08/05/2012 the same engineer was out at my home re a boiler fault (no hot water from the taps) albeit the radiators were heating up fine.He identified a faulty valve and said he would order the part saying it should be available at the end of the week.After no word, I contacted npower on 14/05/2012 cust.services said they would chase it up and I would be contacted within 40min.Three times I called them that day still no joy. I eventually got someone at about 6pm that day who abruptly told me that my contract had been cancelled on the 27/03/2012 as the engineer had reported to them that my boiler was corroded and not fit for contract.I have all my service copies with nothing re this on any of them.Their explanation for this was that the writing on that part had not transferred through to my copy.Funny everything else copied okay. As I said the engineer at no time told me this and I am extremely dubious that I would have signed without noticing his comments.I have asked for a copy of the engineers copy where he had made the comments but I am still waiting.My theory is that when npower saw the fault report and potential cost they have said my policy had been cancelled on 27/03/2012.In addition they never informed me of the cancellation and continued to take my monthly payments.My fixed term expires on 31/05/2012 and I will be leaving npower (even if it costs me more)I would not recommend npower and their homecare plan to anyone BEWARE. 
255|I have just changed to the co-op after hearing that their customer service is excellent from the Martin Lewis website. I changed, not only because of the astonomical charges that npower like to supply to customers, but also I received a reminder from them for a GBP324.00 bill which I had never received, and the reminder was dated two weeks previously.  I rang their so called 'customer care' line and spent 30 minutes on hold before I eventually gave up, then I tried to contact them on their website, which states that they will get back to you within 24 hours (it took them 10 days) in the meantime I got a debt collection letter and also a letter 4 days after telling me of npower's right to enter my house and take my goods, all this and without the original bill they kept referring to.  Now they are writing to me in disbelief that I want to leave them, they really do take the biscuit. I will never use their services again
256|Offer a good deal to get you hooked and then double prices after 6 month.  Very poor customer service.  Had problem 15 years ago with them.  Should have learned my lesson then!!  Leaving at end of may and will never use again even if they offer me free electricity!!!
257|I ended up moving to NPower after receiving a random phone call asking me to compare my usage etc etc.I spent 20 minutes on the phone going through my bills and was then told that Npower could sign me up on a special tariff and my payments would be set at GBP50 and GBP35 a month for each utility. Great I thought! Save me some money I thought! WRONG!!After 8 months of being with Npower, they finally generated my bill, 2 months after the bill date stated on my account. Imagine my reaction when I got to the page that read your new monthly direct debit amount is GBP147 a month & GBP135 a monthThey told me that they had made a mistake with estimating my direct debits, I hadnt paid enough and the new DD amounts were to pay off the debt I owed them and also cover what they estimated I would use for the next 12 months!!Since then I have had nothing but trouble and I now find myself in a payment plan paying off arrears over 24 months as well as trying to manage my current usage (this took 4 months to resolve after countless calls and emails and eventually a complaint).They have sent people round to cut me off 3 times, despite the fact that they hadnt replied to any of my correspondence. I have at least 10 letters saying they are taking me to court or threatening me with other charges for reconnecting my supply.This company is the worst Ive ever had to deal with!
258|I'm writing this review while still waiting on the phone after one hour, I don't know when I will talk to a somebody but I do know I will be changing suppliers
259|Never use Npower you will get ripped off.I went through uswitch and then spoke to 2 sales agents at Npower to change my energy supplier.I was led to believe i had a better deal than what i was previously on.I am now in debtand in fuel poverty after 9 months with Npower.  I was not better off.  I was misquoted and lied to.  I was told the amount i was paying would cover my usage.  It did not. After   I am now over GBP300 in debt after receiving a bill (waited 6 month). I have phoned twice and spent over an hour each time on the phone.  They said my usage had increased hence the debt.  It was another lie my usage had actually decreased year on year.  I have kept meter readings since 2007.  They then said we will ring you with a resolution after 24 hours .  They did not.  I then had a supervisor tell me she had listened to my calls and they had not promised a resolution.  Another lie.  They will then pass you on the another department and give you the run around, Saying that it is a sales issue, even though previously when you phone they will tell you it is a complaints issue and put you through to the complaints department.  Either way you will not get any help from them.  It is a NATIONAL SCANDAL- BE WARNED dont put yourself through what i have- DONT USE NPOWER
260|Was enticed to switch 6 months ago by low price deal. After 6 months they have almost trebled my monthly direct debit payments that were set at the amount that they specified in the first place! Have also had to pay extra GBP757 to pay off arrears that have accumulated as they underestimated my initial direct debits to make it look as if they were cheaper than my original supplier. Feel that I have been ripped off by Npower. They were also unhelpful when I called them and gave me two completely different figures that my direct debits should be set at when I rang on two different occasions. Watch out!!
261|Prepare to be put on hold for a long time (30 mins+).Incredibly irritating.I have since found a cheaper supplier and they are chasing me with you-owe-us letters even though I have paid off in full. I highly recommend you to join npower if, and only if, you are a masochist...
262|"joined on a ""low tariff"" sceme in July.Is it just me or are npower deliberately underestimating my electricity usage on their cheap tariff just so they can rely on my indolence at the end of the 12 months cheap deal to finally catch up with my real power usage just when I've moved to their default, rip-off rate?I've had only one e-mail bill in the past 9 months and today their web site is ""down"". Not their new business web site mind, just the one where you input your meter readings."
263|joined npower and was suppossed to have my boiler serviced in dec which never happened,in march my boiler broke down it took npower 2days to come check it,eng came said it needed flushing and once done give them a call to fix the pump.flushing done,npower then takes 48hrs to send out an eng who shows up with no pump not very friendly and npower does not communicate at all you would have to do all the work of calling them and chasing them up.there staff are so unhelpful and rude,its just ridicolous,at this point i got frustrated and lost it,with them.npower is crap the whole service they provide and what they stand for are just nonsense.its now the 7th of april and i still dont have any heating.my advice to anybody out there is to stay away from npower please please pleaseee.
264|Boiler broke down in January took npower three days to send an engineer to attend to it then I was told it needed parts after many phone calls that I had to make (never received promised call backs) and eventually threatening to remove my business from this company a week later a engineer arrived to fit new part ( during this time we had no hot water or heating) then we were told we required extra parts for the boiler but he had carried out a temporary repair to give us some heat and hot water.I have had two dates arranged to have these parts fitted but we were on holiday for the first date and on the second arranged date I was telephoned after 4pm to be told the wrong parts had been sent.I am still waiting for my boiler to be repaired correctly and it is now 30th March.This companies service is an absolute disgrace especially as my wife is disabled and we are supposed to be a PRiORITY CUSTOMER.Please save yourself a lot of trouble and don't use Npower Hometeam
265|NPOWER SAY I USE GBP239 A MONTH GAS AND ELECTRIC !! IM IN A MODEST 3 BED HOUSE 3 OF US!! NOT IN ALL DAY AS WORK!!!....MY NEIGHBOURS WHO ARE ON PAY AS YOU GO METRES USE THAT I A YEAR!!!!!!!! AM SOOO ANGRY WITH THEM!!!!!!! HOW ON EARTH CAN I USE GBP30 EACH A WEEK!!!!! I DONT LIVE IN A MANSION!!!!!! BEEN SOO MAD TODAY BEEN CRYING WITH FRUSTRATION!!!!!!!!! PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME EHO TO CHANGE TO AS IN CANCELLING THIS NOW!!
266|"I wonder what's going on at npower's billing department, or just how many idiots they have in charge of calculating and issuing bills.I live in a smallish 2 bedroom flat with, I would say, ""average"" energy consumption.For the last quarter, npower sent us a bill for around GBP12,000 (that's TWELVE THOUSAND). Obviously this is hopelessly incorrect. And with several phone calls we told them as much (one dim witted operator seriously replied with; ""is it possible you have something that uses a lot of power in your flat?""). Excuse me? Twelve grand's the kind of bill a skyscraper might expect, not a modest 2 bedroom flat.Anyway - they're just NOT getting the message and we keep getting letters demanding the money. Bizarrely some letters are arriving dated 2 months in the past or more (even with a recent post mark date on the envelope) and some letters have my name only, others have both or our names. One letter even had a slightly incorrect address. How does that happen?! I am expecting the demanding tone of their letters to escalate into threats any day now.The saga continues. Presently we are considering our legal options because this is textbook extortion."
267|I recieve 2 bills on consecutive days.The first tells me i'm GBP276 in credit, the second tells me i'm GBP559 in credit. A phone call informs me that i am indeed GBP559 in credit, a lot of credit when my monthly payment is only GBP103.Another phone call establishes that my fuel usage has in fact decreased over the last 12 months and a new payment GBP99 would be appropriate. All good news you would think!Npower then decide to start taking GBP358/ month from my account.On line billing wich I signed up for over 12 months ago : will soon be available .I've been told this six times over the last year.The company billing system is a joke . the last time i called the poor chap was shouting at his computer,waiting for screens to appear while we chatted about the weather.
268|npower sent out a man to take our meter readings (who was incredibly rude) and each time I was there while he took the readings. I received and paid each bill, without checking the readings on the bill admittedly, but why would I need to when I'd seen the man take them down? I missed the man the last time and called npower with a reading myself, and received a dual fuel bill for nearly GBP800!! I had before this been paying about GBP200 a quarter which I thought was cheap but I had only moved there in the past year and assumed it to be very energy efficient compared to my old flat and we also hardly used the heating. It turns out the man didn't enter my readings at their end and the bills they sent me were (very poorly) estimated. I moved house again then and the new house had a different supplier. npower told me if I transferred my npower account over to my new house I could spread my debt over several monthly payments but that if I left npower I couldn't and would have to pay the whole amount then. A man from Southern Electric told me npower were wrong and had to offer me a reasonable payment plan even if I left them, which is what I wanted to do. I contacted npower and they agreed to set up a 6 month direct debit payment plan to pay off the nearly GBP800 I owed due to their mistake. They also agreed I could leave them and still do this, so I told them I was leaving. Now 3 months and several phone calls later npower are still supplying me despite my regular calls to them to tell them I do not wish to be supplied by them. Today they have sent me a letter saying I owe them GBP546.51 immediately as I have fallen behind on payments. As far as I am aware they apply for the direct debit that is set up on my account to make the payments and I have not stopped a payment and the money was waiting to be taken from my bank account. I called npower today to ask what was going on and it appears they have closed the account and not taken the payment but are still supplying me???!! and apparently this is my fault! The man I spoke to in the complaints department tells me it is not possible to pay by direct debit, despite his colleague setting up my direct debit 2 months ago, and that I have to make the payments using a payment card at a post office or other such place. They took the first of the direct debits before closing my account and sent me a payment plan in writing, without a payment card. I said if they have closed the account then I don't owe them anything. How can they close an account if there is an outstanding debt?! Now they have reset my payment plan and are sending me a payment card to make my monthly payments. I have spoken to probably 15 different people at npower and every one of them has made mistake after mistake. I cannot believe the utter incompetence I have encountered from npower in trying to deal with a very simple matter.
269|I have been paying direct debit and was concerned after the winter that I may owe money. I registered on line to find I hade meter readings for 4 weeks ago (so no estimates) and was GBP693.51 in CREDIT. I rang them and for 2 and a half hours had debate, reason and offer of new tarrif when all I want is to be up to date. I have cancelled the direct debit in the hope I can find out what is happening, the bills are beyond confusing and this just seems wrong.
270|Npower has messed up yet again..... A few weeks ago I went to the shop to top up GBP15 on gas and GBP10 on electric but the lady who served me put GBP10 on the electric but nothing on the gas although I was given a receipt saying that she had topped up on both and I also gave her GBP25 for the sale.. So due to this error I contacted npower and was told they would refund me the GBP15 by sending a signal down to a different shop so that when I took my card in it would automatically be placed on it......that was fine I got the GBP15 back but somewhere along the line it's also sent a signal to by meter to take 70% of whatever money I put in.... So put GBP25 in on thu evening and by fri dinner I has run out of gas plus the emergency so phoned n power they admitted that it was an error on their end and an emergency engineer had been called out for MONDAY erm well it's fri today what amI supposed to do from now till then....so the man come and said we have sent another signal down to the meter and we will call u tomorrow between 10-12 (sat) to tell u what to do next.... Never got that call so called npower back again and they said the signal been sent go to shop and put  a GBP1 on your card and then that will activate the signal....guess what it didn't work...phoned npower again and was advised not to put money into my gas meter as it will swallow 70% of it and it would be 3-5 days before the signal will reach my meter... I have 3 children  one at 10 one at 4 and one at 6 months what am I gonna do....npower replied we have done our best there's nothing more we can do ..... Oh Jeeez thanks no gas for 5 days... Apsaloute awful service they dont give a monkeys .... Discusting 
271|Currently sat on hold waiting to talk to npower complaints department. Was told the wait time would be 11- 18 minutes, been on hold for half an hour now. This is after waiting half an hour for a callback that never came, then waiting another 20 minutes on hold then for me to be cut off when the phone was answered. I have been sat here in tears at the frustration of not being able to sort my incorrect bill out ( they have decided to increase my bill from GBP35pm to GBP80pm).Npower are a disgrace and should be stopped from trading. They can't bill us correctly and they can't even answer the phone. Useless, terrible company. I need to change suppliers.....badly.
272|I'm sat here in total shock that an energy company can act in such a way. I'm so numb I can't think if to scream uncontrollably here or go to their office and scream outside of that. They sent me a letter about electricity a while ago, telling me they might have got their meter reading wrong where they mixed day and night up, so I phoned the number on the letter to ask why that would have happened and the woman told me that it was just something they sometimes send out and to ignore it because it's doubtful they would have got the reading wrong. Then as a person who has one storage heater and a calor gas heater so that I don't have to spend too much in electricity, I had a bill for GBP900 pounds. I phoned the company in shock and the man on the phone told me to do a meter reading, then told me they had got it wrong so they would send me another bill with the correct reading. Instead of another bill, I had a letter from a debt collection agency threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay GBP900 plus extra for sending it to a debt collection ageny. I phoned the company back up and a woman told me there was no record that I had done the meter reading and to do it again, then told me it was wrong. I'm hoping they'll send me a proper bill as if not I'm going to have to sue them for mental distress.
273|"I have sadly been a customer with this company for a very long time. Recently after being made redundant, I contacted them to explain my current financial situation. Strangely, I got no reply to my countless attempts, until after I had approached the ombudsman.They ignore you, and send you off to a debt recovery agency who harass you constantly. I have now been ""Forced"" to have a pre payment meter. Apparently I have no choice, as they own the meter!Avoid these people like the plague. They are simply greedy and uncaring. I also approached my water supplier, who took on board my situation, and put me on a very affordable payment plan. Amazing, as I owed the same amount to the power supplier.If I could award minus points, I'd still be typing all the zero's!"
274|Finally decided to leave nPower.  They've provided poor customer service, very inaccurate bills, they change account information with no prior notice.  Complicated charging.  I do not recommend them.
275|My Gas standing charge was increased by 350% (from 60 per year to 250 per year) the increase was hidden because they delayed my bills then changed my billing from quarterly to 6 monthly so I didn't detect the increase until it was too late. They also sent me a letter talking about increases but it did not show the annual amount for the standing charge had been changed. After spending weeks complaining about the increase I got nowhere. Even the Ombudsman refused to help because it was considered a 'Commercial decision'. OK fine, it was a commercial decision - does that make it fair, ethical or reasonable? I'm now in debt to Npower. Npower made huge record profits in 2011 off the back of struggling consumers. This is a great example of fat cat corporations ripping off British citizens.Also feel agrieved? Use consumer power - write your own reviews in as many places as you can and write letters to the press and complain to the Energy secretary. Give this terrible company as much bad publicity as they deserve. Don't allow them to profit from hard working people. 
276|I was lured by an npower doorstep salesman in February 2011 saying I'd save GBP200+. It's a scam... don't buy it. They hike up their charges between November-February to cover the GBP200. Plus you have gigantic bills to pay in the middle of winter. Their customer services department are aware of this scam and defend it like hell. I agree with the other reviewer.. why are these people allowed to trade like this and what are OFGEM supposed to be doing? We pay them to protect us... don't we?
277|We are 4 students sharing a house for 5 months now and today we have just received our 1st bill from Npower for gas and electricity. what the surprise it was when we read it!! we have been charged of 1000GBP for 5 months of gas, so huge!!! In fact, we live in a very bad isolated house, we heat it only 5 hours a day and the maximum temperature we got is hardly 17°... and now it is only 14°.. can you imagine living in a house with this temperature and paying this amount?? for me and my housemates, there was of course a mistake. after having discussed with other students living in the same conditions as us and heating as us, we realized that they pay at maximum 480GBP for 5 months gas.so we called Npower (that was endless) and explained them everything, but they just said that this was the normal consumption. such liars! moreover at the end of november we gave them our meter reading and they estimated our consumption for 6 months of 400GBP...so now we have this bill to pay but of course as students we are not able to pay it so we are trying to make everything to make Npower realise that there is surely a problem with the meter reading or something else.As 2 of us are french students, we really don't know what we can do to sort it out.Do you think it would be useful not to pay this bill and try to make an arrangement with them because I am pretty sure if we pay them we will never see our money back...please give us advice!
278|I was a npower customer from jan 2011- may 2011. I had to vacate this house in may 2011. I orderd for a bill , pais it completely. I even called up npower to make sure my name was taken off frm the acct cos i shifted. I got the acct transferred into other tenants name. Everything was fine, until i got a call frm Dra in jan 2012, tellin tat i owe 170GBP to npower. It tuk me for shock.. I did explain to these bloody agencies tat i dint owe anything to npower, bt they insisted me givin sm proofs. I then requested the other tenants frm my previous home to send me a npower bill which showed i was no more liable. When i called up npower to cimplain abt it, i had to xplain my story to every person thr, who said they wud transfer my call to sm other dept. Wen i finally explained this to a person, she asked to provide proof tat i was. Nt at home after may2011. I told her tat bill frm npower frm may2011 was nt on my name. But she insisted me to giv my tenancy agreement letter. I found it to be so stupid cos thwy dnt beleive their own bills. It was so annoyin to get calls frm DRA every mornibg, harassin me to pay npower. Wat a shame!! I had to call up npower 3-4 times a day to sort this out which shooted up my mobile bill. It was a trauma .. I have stopped gettin calls nw, bt i dnt knw whether its sorted out. Shame on npower n its working systems
279|The Business Energy Company rang me early Jan (I had just moved in to a unit run by Peterborough Council, who told me that they would sort the energy out and someone would be in touch), they guy on the phone (I want to name the **** but my wife has advised me against it!! So I'm playing the decent person!!!!!) led me to believe he was representing the council, gave me a pack of lies - when I told him I had a friend who worked for Utilitrack and was going to help with the electricity supply the **** said that 'Utilitrack were just brokers, but he could offer me the best deal' etc etc Swore blind he wasn't broker. To cut a very long story short he took my bank details having told me there was a cooling off period. It was only when he said he was recording that he started talking very fast and got me to confirm everything. The next day I discovered I'd been duped and they were actually Sandown Holdings, rang NPower, who told me to get the transcript, rang Sandown only for the same guy to ring back saying I could cancel when I got the paperwork. It was all delaying tactics and the supply has now gone to NPower. I have put the contract into dispute but found out today that NPower have found nothing wrong with the verbal contract - they are as bad as the brokers. All these people are absolute liars, I wouldn't trust any of them. It doesn't hold NPower in a good light, they reckon they've done nothing wrong (I said to the guy from NPower today ' So if I steal something and give i to you, then you've done nothing wrong if you know it's wrong??' - I am tied into a three year deal at three times the price I should be paying. NPower say they'll escalate it if I get a full transcript, Sandown Holdings say they will send me one but reading stuff on here I have feeling it may be 'edited'! NOBODY SHOULD TRUST NPOWER
280|Ongoing problem with boiler care package numpty did not turn up on pre-booked day for boiler service, when I phoned up to enquire why, NPOWER said, oh he phoned up to cancel but your phone was engaged so he left it at that. You could not make it up. Probably this worst customer service in the world. 
281|By now there's not a great deal left to say about this vile company. After fraudulently undercharging 2 million customers (and being fined next to nothing for doing so, thanks mighty OFGEN, what would we do without you...?) you'd like to think they couldn't think of any new fraudulent business practices. Guess again...Recently tried to transfer to a less verminous supplier after finally paying off the deliberately generated underpayment NPower made me run up and you won't believe it but, apparently, I can't transfer my account. Incredibly, NPower don't know what kind of meter I have. Deliberate fraud notwithstanding they've billed me for normal/low rate supply for more than 5 years but now I want to transfer to another supplier, they have no idea what kind of meter I have. I may have low rate, I may not. They don't know. If I haven't I guess that means they've changed me for thousands of low rate units that I haven't used, but that would make them fraudsters wouldn't it? Oh, guess we have some precedent for that. Sadly the 'regulator' for these low life is entirely toothless, and has no concern whatsoever for protecting the public. DO NOT GO TO NPOWER for any reason, they routinely operate entirely outside the law, safe in the knowledge that the contemptible tap on the wrist fines they receive are a small fraction of the money they steal.
282|My pensioner mother is in terrible distress. She had her gas and electric supplied by Scottish Power and was happy.On November 1st she got a letter from Npower which she thought was a circular so she didn't open it. It transpires the letter was telling her that she would be transferred over to Npower. She never requested the transfer but it seems she had to contact them to say she didn't want to switch or they would go ahead. And go ahead they have. Scottish Power have told her they are sorry but the switch has already been done.I don't see how this can be legal. I have just found out about this and will be ringing npower to melt the ear off whoever is unlucky enough to answer the call tomorrow.Absolutely FUMING about this. 
283|Well they didn't get in the mass media for committing fraud on 2.2 million customers for nothing.In fact nPower are worse than the review here, you can't give lower than one star unfortunately.Here is my recent complaint to them, you can see how much blatant fraud they are committing by consequently charging me triple the agreed amount.Ofgem advices me to start the legal process with the official complaint as follows, please read this, it speaks for it self in detail:Ref: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/consumer_affairs/article3986108.eceThis is a formal complaint.I initially contacted you last year in September when I moved in to my new home.During my first conversation with one of your sales reps, despite initially explaining that I had just moved in to this address, Adele Caster informed me that I have an outstanding balance of GBP203.00 due to pay on my account from the period of January 2010 - July 2010.I explained again that I had just moved in to this address and was enquiring about my energy provider, I moved in to this address on September 24th 2010.Adele was very professional and pleasant to speak to on the phone, in her credit.I was however impressed by the low sounding bill based on my research of which energy provider would be best for me.As nPower where already the supplier of my household and that the previous owners tariff sounded good, I asked Adele if I could open a new contract, exactly the same as the previous owners.She agreed to this and we went thru the process of setting up my account, which was a nice an easy process.Within a month I had my first bill and could clearly see that the tariff had been increased by over 40% of the agreed rate, I had not been informed of this price increase which is a legal requirement and standard practice of all businesses that are altering there illegal contracts that may have a clause overwriting trading standards law that allows them to do so.I would like to add that if a contract is in breach of consumer rights laws, then the contract itself is in fact illegal, an extreme example of an illegal contract would be a a contract to kill someone, as this contract is also not legal, you cannot rewrite the law or waver consumer rights with illegal contracts, that is for the government to decide only.Upon contacting nPower the price increase was confirmed with an attitude of tough luck, everyone has to deal with it, again I was not informed prior and the increase was an illegal alteration of my existing 12 month contract.A few months later and I notice that my non fixed tariff has not varied since my winter time bill, as my home is entirely powered by electricity, including heating, I found this to be odd.** I contacted you again and found that my tariff had again been altered, the alteration was sold to me fairly well and I was informed that all the energy companies are doing this (a lie).I was now on the economy 7 contract which I hadn't authorized, I was responsible for putting in my own meter readings on a variable tariff that refunds or increases my bill if anything is over or under paid, for which the alteration is made on the next bill.This would mean that it would be impossible for me to owe a large outstanding amount, and vice versa.From the winter season to July my bill remained exactly the same GBP42.00 despite giving meter readings, this of course is impossible considering my routine was the same, and that my home was not being heated by any electric heaters.In all those months absolutely no money was refunded for over payment, it occurred to me that you where also not obligating any refunds of over payment, and by August you increased my bill, without notice and again inside of the initial 12 month contract to a further 50% increase on top of the 40% increase I was already being made to pay, and you had done so again illegally.You have not honored your side of the contract by altering the difference in energy usage payment as stated where you will credit the difference on the account, you have only fixed the maximum payment based on the highest all time usage.For this reason, and and the fact that I had given you the benefit of the doubt three times in a row, I decided to seek out an alternate and honest energy provider, I immediately found one that can provide my energy at the same rate that we agreed upon in my initial 12 month contract.I'd like you to know scroll up to the ** to reinforce one of the errors you made when handling a customer, it is not a recommended practice to insult peoples intelligence by making it a company policy to lie to customers, even if they are politely British.Due to the fact that my 12 month contract was now at an end, and that you have added 40% to my tariff without notification, not credited my account with overpayment's and then decided to add an additional 50% on top of this without notification, I decided to seek other providers.As stated above, I have found a new provider that is going to put me on the same amount that I should have been charged by nPower for, for the previous year.Having checked my nPower online account early this morning I was shocked to see the addition of a bill dated July 2010 for some GBP203.00.I clicked the view button and nothing happened so I opened the page in an alternative internet browser and performed regular checks.The other bill of GBP65 opened fine.I contacted you this morning having contacted my new provider who explained to me that it would be a good idea to ask nPower if they have a 'Start Date' for my new contract.While enquiring about the new 'start date' that I can switch to my new provider with you, I enquired about the payment dated July 2010 and explained that it was from the previous owner, all the while I had this page open in two different internet browsers right in front of me as my computer is situated next to my phone.The sales representative forwarded my call to the accounts department who I explained that the bill was from the previous owner, and that it was the same amount that I had been initially accused of owing you upon the very first call described at the top of this email when I spoke to Adele Caster regarding setting up my account.Having spent some time politely explaining why I'm leaving nPower and that maybe the account can get saved due to an investigation and amendment for all the over payments, the representative  suddenly brought up the issue of the GBP203.00 weird July 2010 bill attached to my account and claimed that in fact it was for the previous July of 2011.Remember I have this bill in front of me and it is labeled July 2010.Also keep in mind that I pay by direct debit and have been overcharged the winter rate, I have been charged on a flat rate instead of a variable rate using the credit and debit system for over or under payments, and that these payments where supposed to get adjusted every month which come directly out of my bank account via direct debit.The representative then went on to insist that I owe this phantom bill which would be impossible because of our payment arrangement.I then refreshed the nPower website on my account, and was horrified to see that on the first internet browser I had refreshed, the date of the bill had been removed, at which stage I'm guessing that you just make anything up as you go along.I have contacted Ofgem as they are handling the issue of nPower over charging 2.2 million other customers (Ref) with various account fraud or to be kind, mis handling, and I'm estimating you have embezzled some 30 million from customers in this manner thus far.Personally I can foresee a class action lawsuit plus damages in the not to distant future, but personally I would prefer to avoid hassle of spending 2 hours digging out all the evidence of the abuse on my account to date, because I am a busy person.As a result of Ofgens advice I am registering this formal complaint as a legal requirement, regardless of any outcome.Having read this email I'm sure you can understand how patient I have been and how the situation is enough to upset anyone.I am also taking a meter reading tomorrow so that I can phone nPower accounts department in the vague hope that we can sort out this mess and amend my account so that as a customer and a supplier, we have a future together.I also prefer working with people that have learnt from experience, than people that have none at all.With Regards
284|"Ok here we go....... Once upon a time an Npower customer decided to have PV Solar Panels installed. 3 months after the panels were fitted his electricity meter was still running backwards when the Solar Panels were producing energy. His first phonecall to Npower resulted in the operator telling him this was supposed to happen!!! even though he knew it wasnt. After another phone call someboby agreed with him and arranged for the meter to be changed. The meter man arrived in due course and told him he needed a backstop meter, a meter which he did not carry despite the situation being explained twice on the phone.A few weeks later the meter man arrived and fitted a back stop meter but he was not 100% happy with the meter and after a series of phone calls informed the customer he needed an import/export meter. Later on the customer had a phone call saying the date had been set to have the import/export meter fitted and it would only cost just under GBP200. The customer told Npower to ""shove it"" and if the wernt happy with the meter they would have to pay because as far as he was concerned it was super. He then tried to contace the Microgeneration Team to start claiming his payments at first he was succesful but they informed him that the first 100ish units of electricity he had generated would not be paid for because at the time they were generated they were still waiting for the official certificates so the greedy Npower fat cat pocketed the customers GBP50 even though the elecricity could only have gone to Npower. After that it became increasingly difficult to contact the Microgeneration Team as one day the entire department had the day off.......every last one of them even the office cat! The next time he tried to call them at 1015hrs only to be told via answer machine the line was only open between 0900-1800 hrs! The customer got very frustrated and made some complaints and waited for his promised phone call back the same day from the Manager at Microgeneration, after 2 days he realised this wasnt going to happen and tried to get hold of them again, Hurrah they picked up the phone and took a meter reading and informed the customer ""it was a good job you got called today as its the cut off point for meter readings"". The customer explained that he was unaware of this and jotted down the cut off dates as the had never been sent to him after 6 months of supplying electricity to Npower. After 2 weeks the customer rang back wondeering where his cheque was, he was the informed he would have to wait......60 days for his cheque.......2 Months.....8 weeks!!! He asked if he could have the same deal for paying his bills but they were not amused. After contacting them again informing them this didnt seem very fair he was told a Manager would ring him back, so the customer waited and waited and waited but nobody called. So the customer then found out he would get paid 2p a unit more from Utility Warehouse and they only took 30days to send you payment so the customer switched everything over to them and decided to tell NPower that they are the most useless, robbing, bunch of half wits it has ever been his misfortune to converse with and the customer lived happily ever after!"
285|After nearly a year with NPower I had been paying GBP40 a month DD for my gas and electricity, I supplied meter readings when requested and never missed a payment. Imagine my dismay when I received a bill for GBP350, which was a debt I owed, due to my DD not covering my usage. I called the customer service department on several occasions to find out how a house that is unoccupied all day and most of the weekend could use GBP84 a month worth of fuel (the new quote for my usage)? After lots of different answers, I was told that Npower as a company are expensive and that my account had not been checked since I had switched to them and they had underestimated the DD from the very beginning. I was furious, and demanded that my debt be written off as it was their error. They have refused, and I am now supposed to pay GBP109 per month to cover usage and my debt. I have switched suppliers back to EDF, who I never incurred any problems with, just to be rid of NPower and forgoing the cancellation charges, hopefully this will happen before the next payment is due to go out. However I still have a debt to pay off at GBP25 a month for a whole year. My advice to anyone reading this....stay away from NPOWER at all costs, they will cause you nothing but stress, misery and a very depleted bank balance!!
286|I have been with NPower for Gas and Electric since 2008 and have found them to be a good company to deal with. I also found their discounts for DD generous. I have cecently changed my gas supplier from NPower to EON because their capped rate tariff was for a longer period at the time than NPower were offering. I am still with NPower for Electric and would consider coming back to NPower in the future.  
287|I switched to npower when I moved into my previous flat. I gave them the metre number and address details, and paid by direct debit.I was a happy customer of theirs for 6 or 7 months until, a few days before I moved out, I got a knock on the door from E.on who handed me a bill for GBP631 and a GBP30 charge for hand delivering the letter.It turned out that npower had never switched my supply, but they had charged me GBP42 per month for it anyway. E.on had been sending letters to the address in the name of the previous tenant. These were returned un-opened never thinking that they were actually my supplier.After calling npower I was told an investigation would take place and it would take 2 months to get a result. I called them again after a week or so to complain and suddenly the investigation was complete, and they admitted their mistake.They offered to refund the amount I had paid them, but this was considerably less than the amount I had to pay E.on because of npower's false bills.I have been taking part in the complaints procedure for over a month now and it is still not sorted. The last time I was contacted by npower was 11 or 12 days ago, and at that point my complaint was being escalated to the executive complaints department.I can't stress enough how much of a stressful and expensive experience this has been during the process of moving house and starting a new job.Never use npower, I know I never will again.
288|"Nearly three years of misery with NPower!  I made the mistake of changing to one of their fixed price tariffs. As soon as that happened, they suddenly stopped reading the meters, kept sending me ""estimated"" bills which were much higher than my actual usage, and then putting up my direct debit amount by a huge amount without any notice. I sent them my meter readings, by phone, and online, they just ignored them. I was hundreds of pounds in credit with them by the time I finally got a correct bill from them. That took nearly nine months to sort out. So I was determined to change to another supplier as soon as my fixed term contract ran out. I sent them an accurate meter reading the day my fixed term tariff expired.. They ignored it, and estimated a much LOWER amount of units than I had actually used. That's so they could charge me more units at the new higher rate when I got my next bill. So my ""final"" bill with them was much too high - went through all the figures with customer service on the phone, was told it would be sorted in a week with the right figures sent to me, but a couple of weeks later got a really nasty letter threatening debt collectors because of my ""unpaid bill"". They are by far the worst energy company for customer service I've ever come across. OK if you have no problems, but any problems at all, good luck getting them sorted out! They were forced by Ofgen last year to give millions of customers refunds because of the sharp practice of making a tariff ""year"" any amount of time they said it was, not a year, so they could put prices up and still say you'd had a full ""year"" at the lower price. Just shows how little they really care about their customers."
289|OMG the worst customer services i ever dealt with!8 months and they couldnt swap over my 3 properties!exagerated bills, exagerated sales pitch!landlords beware!!
290|Check your bills!  I was with N-Power from 2008 - 2010 after one of their salesmen claimed they could save me roughly GBP200 a year on my quarterly energy bills.  This was not the case. My bills didn't arrive quarterly - they came 5-6monthly AFTER i'd rang and requested them!  They put one of my meter readings 900 digits out causing a huge bill, then when they re-billed me they'd only knocked GBP100 of the bill. I resulted in working the bill out myself and taking it to the CEO, after a DELIBERATE GBP300 overcharge!  Upon leaving them early last year, I had to chase my bill up every week for 8weeks although I was then getting my new suppliers bills. Then they had the cheek to send me a final reminder and ask me if I'd like to go on a re-payment plan to help pay my bill!   My bills went up by nearly 100% whilst with N-Power!  Would not recommend them to my worst enemy!!
291|I have been with Npower since 2008 changed to a quaterly bill from a prepayment meter.  recieved by first bill which was GBP315 which i quieried and was told that there had been a mistake and not to pay until bill sorted out after numerous calls and an engineer from Npower finally got my new bill in at GBP970 i called the accounts dept to arrange payment and was quoted a rediculous amount which i could not pay.  the bill now stands at GBP1,590.00 and it has been passed to a collection agency who were asking for GBP200 per month.  i have been to the CAB who agreed with me this is teh worse company they should not be getting away with this.                  
292|Gothem!  Just caught npwer trying to sneak in some fictional numbers into my bill!!! About GBP110! Luckily got aaall the bills an ststements to prove it... Its the capitalism man! Or Exploatation in translation. Open all yer eyes!  Antisatan  Devil is weaker every day! Hey-yei-yei!
293|had prepayment meters installed 14 mths ago and have had nothing put problems since. they owe me money put keep registering it as a debt on my meter.  they have admitted several times that it is their mistake but seem unable to rectify it.Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy
294|This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. I live in a 2 bedroom house on my own and have beem hospitalised for 3 months, thay have asked me to pay a bill of over GBP700 from aug 2010 to January 2011. and are sending me letter to pay. How is this possible I spent from sep 2010 to beginning of dec 2010 in hospital. I tried to sort this over the phone guy came round to check my meter and said ignor the letter they will send me a updated bill. as I waited they sent me more threatning letters. And did not want to listen to me all they wanted was the money. I advise people to stay away from this company they con people. (I was told by the person who came around that they send people threatning letter to scare them into paying).
295|I have been with Npower for around 9 months and have recently moved to another supplier, I received a letter stating that they need to inspect my gas meter for health and safety reasons, if I didn't call back with in 7 days they will get a notice to force entry, I called back and made an appointment, no one showed up, I tried calling them several times but due to snow the department was closed and staff moved to boiler break down, I then got a letter stating as I never got back to them they will now approach magistrates, I finally got through and a guy came, I also got a boiler breakdown service from them and that was waste of time, I was without heating for 5 days and no one could get to me, One manager authorise me to take out the repair and they will pay up to 100 pounds, so I did and its been a month and no one knows anything about this, complete waste of time.
296|Poor energy suppliers. Signed up in Nov 2009 and started prviding me with gas and electricity in jan 2010. Have only ever received 1 bill from them. I called them today to find out that I owe them over GBP500 and that has taken into account my discounts, direct debit payments etc. I called them to complain that they have my metre readings and should have thought to call me and increase my direct debit payments. Possibly the worst company I have ever dealt with. Will be leaving NPower this week.  How do they get away with it???? Customer complaints were no help at all. terrible terrible company with no ciustomers care at all.
297|"First Utility have failed to give me a gas bill for 12 months despite monthly calls to check why not. I signed up as a dual fuel customer, and they cannot seem to resolve a gas ""issue"". I cannot be more specific than that because the call centre cannot tell me what the issue is, or why they cannot resolve it!! SO frustrating I cannot begin to say. I am also paying more for my Electric because I am not yet registered as a Dual customer, something they promise will be resolved every month but never is. A totally incompetent organisation. All I can say is if you are thinking of transferring to them, DON'T!!"
298|"Possibly the WORST energy supplier ever!!   I moved into a property last December which had NPower.  After checking the prices etc I thought ok I would continue using them.  Then in February I received a SHOCKINGLY HIGH gas bill and realised that the way how NPower calculates their Tier 1 and Tier 2 readings are what I would call illegal.  They place a significantly high allocation on Tier 1 during winter months, so basically for a low user like me ALL my gas consumption would be under Tier 1 throughout the whole year.   PLEASE BE AWARE of this when you are using price comparison web sites!!  The Worst thing is that one of the staff told me by calculating this way it would be cheaper for me!  What a nonsense!!!  After 4 months I changed to another supplier.  But Npower refused to accept my final meter reading - as they said it's too low and ""doesn't make sense"".   YES I have switched my gas off in Feb after reading the bill!   They however refused to send someone to read either.  After around 10 phone calls, 8 apologies letters, but at the same time other 6 court threatening letters;  they finally cancelled the my final bill of (non-existing) GBP20 when I said I would complain to Ofgem and Watchdog.     No energy company is perfect but NEVER EVER USE NPOWER - They can send apologies letters and court letters to you at the SAME TIME.  And lies about customer ""savings"". "
299|Npower Fixed price repair - rubbish, don't bother  I booked (well in advance) a fixed price boiler repair to address some minor issues with my boiler (a noisy fan and minor leak). The heating is still working, and as such it wasn't an emergency, which is why I booked it well in advance to make sure the repair could be done when I was able to take some time off work.  I needed the appointment to be in the morning, as I had another appointment later in the afternoon. When I booked the appointment I was assured that morning appointments were between 8 and 1, which was an ideal time.  On the morning of the appointment I hadn't heard anything by 10.30 and was getting concerned that the engineer wouldn't have time to fix the boiler by 1pm, so I made my first call. I was told that, contrary to the first call I made (when they wanted my money!), that a morning appointment meant the engineer would ARRIVE by 1pm at the latest.  I accept that this was a minor fabrication by the first person I spoke to in order to secure my booking, so I patiently waited for the call from the engineer. As 1pm came and went with no call or engineer, I called the call centre back.  I spoke to a lady who was very blunt and said the engineer might be (might be!?!) running late. She then went off to find out, confirming the obvious that the engineer was running late - I'd figured that out all by myself! I half expected her to let me know that bears go in the woods, but that's probably not in her script.  I was, understandably, less than pleased and told her so, at which point she flippantly said it 'wasn't her fault' and the planners hadn't told them so what could she do?  If these planners know engineers are running late, why aren't they letting people know?? I have booked half a day off work which has been wasted as I have had to sit in waiting for an engineer not to turn up. 
300|I have recently left a property and npower owe me hundreds of pounds in over payments.  They are refusing to send me what they owe me until they have read the meter at the property (despite the fact that myself and the new owner submitted the same final meter readings).  So getting my money back is dependent on npower gaining access to a property that I don't have access to myself!  This is not the first time they have over charged me and then delayed repayment - I am convinced they make a lot of money in interest on the money they overcharge their customers
301|My advice is, and that of any regulatory body should be, NEVER NEVER NEVER LET NPOWER DIRECT DEBIT YOU. Even better.. avoid them at all costs. Pay quarterly by single payment if you have to but not by DD. Direct Debit is how they are ripping us off across the board - and Oftel are letting them. With their direct debit system charging me monthly over the odds, I knew I was quite well in credit and a letter I'd just received from Npower prior to leaving them confirmed that I was, to the amount of over GBP400. On trying to leave them, however, they insisted I owed THEM over GBP50!!! Only two years later have they paid me back and after much wrangling and writing to a national newspaper.
302|For 2 years nPower have refused to accept that my flat exists. My bill is sent to me but states 'for usage at ... a completely fictional address'.  I recently found out that MeterPlus, the company responsible for the legal safety check on my meter, are taking me to court as I don't respond to the letters that never reach me because nPower gave them a fictional address.   The letter states that it goes to court on 19th November, the call centre tells me they already have a warrant and will force entry on 15th Nov if I am not there (which I wont be, I'll be at work, earning the money to pay the bill which I have never once been late paying). I have made upwards of 10 0845 calls (and countless others that didn't even get through the hold music) to sort this out over the last day, I have been promised a call back 4 times and not yet received one.   I am actively looking to change suppliers despite the alternatives all looking just as bad!!
303|Overall rating - i've scored them 1 however this is only because this is the lowest available rating there is. Personally i rate them a 0 infact -0. I am livid, appaulled by the way this company has tried to deal with an 'error' on their part which has greatly inconvinienced me financially and with regards to the time and telephone calls i have wasted whilst trying to resolve this mess! Offering me peanuts for my stress, wasted time and costs incurred whilst trying to get this rectified - This company is a JOKE, a sorry excuse of a company! And judging from the other reviews on here im not the only person who's suffered because of the incompetant, unprofessional nature of this company.Avoid at all costs! I am not happy at all.
304|Hi I ordered simple 'Gas Boiler Service' which is required by my insurer (I'm not with n Power). The service was easily booked, PAID and arranged (AM visit 8.30-1.00). Took half a day off from work, waited for the engineer when phone rang about 10.30am - they had to cancel it because of lack of engineers that day. I wasn't able to decide about when to reschedule the visit and asked for the call back same day afternoon. It never happened so I called them couple of days later only to hear that it was to late to book an appointment as the customer service was only dealing with emergencies (8PM) but nice lady at least took a note of my call, all my details and adviced someone would call me in the morning the following day. Imagine what, nobody called the following day, and the following and ... So I rang them, told the story and the response from the guy on the other side was he's got nothing on the system. I don't care about their system if their lazy to update it. Anyway I arranged another visit and asked the engineer to be as early as possible (slot 8.30am-1pm). Guess what time he turned up - 12.30 :) Highly not recommend them because of the customer service.  Gas boiler check was GBP74 which is not cheap as chips and it took month and a half to receive between the first call and the visit.  The engineer did a service which is nothing sophisticated (cleaning boiler with vacuum cleaner etc).  DTF
305|Am trying to get my gas prepayment meter taken out. 2 appointments and still no engineers.  1st time they said I wasnt in!!!! I was.  2nd time they said they phoned and didnt get an answer??? no they didnt!! What has that got to do with anything I was in??? Now got to wait another 2 weeks for another appoibntment. lets see what the excuse is this time. 
306|N Power are con artists.They told me they were cheaper than british gas and they were lying.I am on a pre payment meter and was with them for 5 months.They then sent me a bill for GBP50.I tried to make a complaint and kept recieving threatening letters and court summons.Take my advice and go with British gas they are friendly and helpful.N power will cost more and will try and con money out of you.Don't ever let the reps come to your home and con you into moving with them they are definately not cheaper.
307|Have been with Npower since 2008 and have found them to be a reasonable energy company. I find their discounts to be good and straight forward. However, Im not that impressed with 6 monthly statements for my gas and electric. Customer services are always polite and helpful but when I first changed to Npower I had difficulties with switching from my previous supplier. 
308|Joined Npower in 2008 when I moved into my flat which had economy 7 heating. Although what they claimed i owed was not as much as most on here it was still shocking. I live in a fairly small 2 bedrom flat and was paying GBP73 a month but somehow still managed to owe them money. When I contacted the customer service centre no less than 3 times they were useless although somebody did give me a free phone number which they tend to not give out to customers, probably to get more money out of us, the number is 0800551555. After speaking with customer service one advised that I do my washing during the night as its cheaper!!!!! They are a bunch of muppets and would advise anyone to steer clear.
309|Terrible company...they overestimate your usage and take lots of money out of your current acccount. Even when they know that your gas account is in credit (mine is GBP280 in credit), they continue to take more money from your current account. The same applies to my elec account- they have taken way too much out of my bank account.  They dont pay the cash back to your bank account for at least 12 months (their company's policy) - this is robbery as they obviously use customer's monies to invest or earn interest.   A very dishonest company and their tariffs are hard to understand- a deliberate act to confuse customers.  Avoid at alll costs!
310|I do understand that there are a lot of bad reviews regarding npower, but i would like to say that things are not always as bad as people are making out. Yes some people may have a few problems regarding there direct debits but you all have to admit at least when you call you do not have to go through lots of different menu's to get to speak to a advisor. All so the customer service team will offer to ring you back if you need it and there is a free phone number for them as well.
311|Reading you lots review i am just going to say it is the worst company.... that is  sent from hell. come on i just got a 195 pound bill for 3 months just for electricity.  from now on i will never hear about some npower company from anyone and i advise you the same.  
312|The only reason they have a 1 star off me is that I couldn't give any lower! I was regularly paying my bill by direct debit (GBP106 pcm) until I received a letter stating I was two months behind (not true) the following day I had another letter stating my direct debit had been cancelled due to my account being in arrears! wait wait, it gets better, on the third day I get a letter from a DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY saying I owed nPower nearly GBP700!!! - These people are complete and utter jokers and the whole industry needs to be better regulated, I am now leaving my rental accommodation at the end of this month and if it wasn't for the fact my landlord was a friend of mine I'd not pay them a further penny! muppets!!
313|I am currently stuck with npower but will be moving the first chance I get.  They have sent bailiffs to my house twice now, looking for someone that hasn't lived here for over a year - despite being sent two copies of our tenancy agreement, and happily taking payments from the people that actually DO live here..  I have done 7 metre readings in the last year, only to be called at night and asked to do another one and was then sent an estimated bill...  To top it all off someone from their debt department rang MY mobile phone last week asking for the previous tenant and were very surprised to hear that this wasn't his number.  They don't know their backside from their elbow, no one department talks to another and I have had enough of their inadequacy.
314|I left NPOWER to move over to eon.We previously paid a debt over a pre-payment meter of GBP440.Since leaving them they've now decided that we owe them a further GBP450.They will not provide me with meter readings or give me any explanation as to how the debts accumulated, if we owed them this sum before we moved suppliers, why let us move at all? I don't see how it's possible to accumulate debts whilst on a prepayment scheme anyway.We have put in excess of GBP1600 on the meter in a year, how can we owe them money, surely they owe us some with that amount being added to our account.
315|I'm in the middle of a huge argument with this company. I switched to them in Jan 2007 and since then have been paying quarterly for my gas and electricity by direct debit. Completely out of the blue, without explanation, in July 2010 we received an electricity bill for GBP4300. An anxious call to their customer service department elicited the explanation that (despite frequent visits by meter readers and proof that they had actually received the meter readings) they had been direct debiting for estimated bills, that it was my fault for not realising this, and that the new bill came from recalculating my electricity over the entire period. Various discussions led to the conclusion that they had miscalculated the bill by charging all of our E7 electricity at the day rate, but the recalculated bill arriving a few days later was for more than GBP5000! Further telephone calls to the complaints department led them to recalculate the bill a second time, which now stands at GBP3200, which they insist is correct. No explanation has been offered for why they had not been direct debiting me correctly for the past three and a half years when they had the correct meter readings all along. The dispute rumbles on. Dreadful.
316|IDIOTS!!!!  Takes months to transfer your accounts over no matter how many calls you make ...... even when they send someone out to take the readings they claim not to receive them.  As for setting up your online account (normally really easy) they say you cant do it resulting in more calls.  I regret transferring and will go back to my other supplier as soon as my contract expires with them
317|"The worst company I have ever had to deal with and I am not even an Npower customer -and never will be from my experience with them.  When I complained about their sales team who tried to pretend they had been sent by my own Electricity company to inspect my meters and also check my account/payment details I eventually got a computer generated letter stating that they had ""investigated my complaint and listened to the validation call that was made when you signed the contract and it's clear that a contract to transfer your gas and electricity supply to npower was agreed.... "" Pardon? A further phone call about the letter confirmed that they only send out computer generated letters and I had been sent the wrong one. So much for their complaints procedure which is obviously dealt with by a robot. Top tip- go elsewhere."
318|Expensive and prone to overcharging. Their customer service was hopeless. We would call to sort out one mistake and they would introduce another. Resulting in an endless cycle of expensive support calls. It at all possible, avoid like the plague.
319|JOKE!  My partner rung npower up a few weeks ago, to get our pre paid meter put into our name. She booked an appointment for a friday, home all day and they failed to turn up. she rung them again to book another appointment and another appointment to reset this meter in our name.  After 4 attempts trying to get them to reset this meet they once again failed to come out to our house.  They was due to come out Friday 9th July between 8am and 1pm. she rung them back and 3 times failed to book our appointment after being told several times it was booked. dont waste your time with the npower customer services you won't get anywhere.  If they say we'll come out to do some maintence or what ever the reason, you may aswell go out or go to work because they won't show up.  Usless company, british gas are also the same.  not arsed unless they are taking your money.
320|Absolutely useless. Estimated my bill repeatedly when I sent through no less than 6 meter readings. They dithered around for 5 months before I finally gave in and paid it. 
321|please I advice everyone neva join np power supplier they will rip you off !!!!!!!
322|Appaling rip off  Avoid them at all costs, and you will never be able to solve anthing with them over the phone. I live in a very small flat and was hit with a GBP1500 bill while paying them the same amount I was paying previous every month.  
323|Pity you can't give a minus rating.  How this company continues to trade is anyone's guess.  Oh yes, they blind the consumer with facts and figures which in the cold light of day don't add up.  Then you have to stay as you owe them loads.  If you are thinking of signing up.  DO NOT.
324|Utter rubbish stay clear.  When I moved house it was a prepay meter,I phoned up to swap to a pay monthly economy 7.  I was paying GBP3 a week to have the thing for a start.  Had to wait 6 weeks, took a day off work for the guy to come but he never arrived.  Phoned up, was called a lier put in a complaint got a GBP20 cheque.  Waited another week for the meter.  After 4 months I get a bill for 600 pounds.  Phone up they say a meter reader had come out on 11th Jan, total lies as I was in Glasgow that week (I stay in Edinburgh), unless my ghost let him in.  Anyway I asked how my bill was so high as i had set up a Direct Debit, was told they forgot to take the money each month.  Whats more my bill was far too high as it was costing GBP20 a week on the prepay.  After i paid 300 i said i would not pay the rest until they look at my meter as MY BILL IS TOO HIGH.  They told me to pay GBP202 a month from now on.  After two complaints and some debt letters it turns out they got my estimated units wrong and my rates the wrong way round....turns out they were now due me money, but still wanted GBP72 pound a month.  I now pay 40 a month with Scottish Hydro.
325|Atrocious customer service, had to ring several times to sort a direct debit issue out, got very different stories/solutions/excuses every time I rang up.   None of the telephone staff were apologetic that no one could get it right and most of them seemed to have sketchy knowledge on the npower processes.  Would steer clear 
326|I've just ended my second and FINAL agreement with Npower due to their 'hidden' rip off charges.  I was with them on their Online 15 Tariff.  I run a 6-monthly check on U-switch as a matter of routine and found that there was a 'cheaper' tariff available - Online 17.  I switched to this tariff and just received their confirmation letter only to find that they have DOUBLED the daily standing charge from 23p to 46p per day so I will be worse off under Online 17.  'Nothing to do with us, this is applied by the independent pipeline provider' but they didn't think to explain this when I originally called to switch.  When I called to switch back to Online 15, they told me that this tariff was no longer available.  The doubling of the daily Standing Charge is shown way down at the bottom of the tariffs and, unsurprisingly, is NOT one of the 3 main terms shown within the 'switch' price box.  Who has EVER read all the Terms and Conditions on a car insurance policy?  However, I have now left Npower for the last time - NEVER AGAIN.  Back to good old Atlantic where I should have stayed.  A lesson learned!  Why not offer a 'minus' star option for companies like these as I baulk at even giving them one star?
327|I had a very high bill due to N Power over estimating the bill but I thought that it would be like every other energy company and give me a few weeks to pay, but after three weeks and a week after I paid the bill at the Post Office I had a letter where they were pretending to be from a company called Collections Direct which was really N Power and the letter was in a very threatening tone with fines and court action for a warrant. I was thinking that it must be really scary for an old person to receive a letter like that and think the company must actually be evil. The letter didn't offer to help with payment plans or say that if I phoned them to explain why it's late they would give me more time. It's an awful company and even though I had paid the bill it made me feel threatened. 
328|Had a dreadful time with NPower. Was told on the phone the rates that i would, but when my confirmation came out it was different. i called and checked this with them and was told dont worry, the rates on the letter must have been the previously printed customers. I stupidly belived this and 6 months later when i recieved a bill with the higher rates on had a 8 month long battle on my hands. The rates quoted and agreed to were over 4p cheaper than those that i had been charged. I was basically told its tough, they couldnt find recordings etc.. as funnily they dont record contract calls - when i told them that i presumed that this meant i had no contract they suddenly changed their minds. This went on for far too long and in the end i contacted watch dog - 4 days later i got an amended bill and a GBP50 credit as way of compensation for the time spent dealing with the issue. Just avoid - stick with British Gas their cheaper and now where near as rubbsish at customer service!
329|This suppliers even dose not deserves 0, worst utility supplier I have ever dealt with, price wise rip off, customer service very rude staff, I hope not to deal with Npower any more and would not recommend to any body.
330|Rating ZERO.  1. Customer service is seriously unpolite and bullying - did not manage to go through one phone call without an argument with them 2. When we moved into our new home, they got my surname wrong 3 times!! Had to call them 3 times to rectify and 3 times received a letter with my surname being wrong again!! 3. When decided to switch to another provided, had to listed to them shaming and blaming the other provider I have been with EDF for previous 3 yrs and had a suprb service from them! Would not recommend NPower to anyone!!
331|N Power - overall rating 0.  This is this worst company I have ever dealt with.  I was sent a bill for over GBP1200, even though I had been telling them for a year they were not charging me for gas, ended up having to pay the equivalant of a mortgage payment every month. Customer service is apalling, bills are confusing. DON'T TOUCH WITH A BARGE POLE! Absolutely useless.
332|OMG I thought I was the only one, reading your reviews is a godsend, why has nothing been done about this ridiculous company. I have never been in debt with a utility supplier ever and since I changed to Npower (the biggest mistake I have ever made) they under estimated my bill for 8 months so you can imagine the shock when I received a duel bill for GBP900.Can I just point out that I received a letter from them within the 8 months saying I was in credit! Not only that the customer services do not give a cuckoo and demand payment, cannot seem to answer any questions as to why this has happened. I have had to result to pre payment meters due to know choice and believe me when this bill is paid I am getting as far away from Npower as I can. I hate them.
333|The Carlsberg of electricity - ie probably the worst electricity provider in the world!  Service / Customer complaints dept are hopeless, set of bully boys - with no teeth if you stand up to them & tell them to please go ahead & take your dispute to court, prices uncompetitive, will try & convince you otherwise by offering an alternative tarrif such as combined gas & electric paid by DD (this despite the fact they were told there was no way they'd get a DD from me & I have no gas in the house)Will do everything they can (& some things I argue they can't to try & force you to stay with them)  Wouldn't recommend Npower to my worst enemy
334|I would have liked to leave a 0 rating for this company. Their service is absolutely rubbish!!  Don't be fooled by their cheaper prices gimmick! remember cheap is not always the best. This is certainly true with NPower.  They took almost 3 weeks to honor an appointment to service and fix a simple boiler trouble. Their engineers simply do not show up when they are booked on an appointment. And when they finally make an appearance, they are very late and do not bring basic parts with them. Even though the problem has been explained beforehand by customers when booking their appointment.   After this experience, we will never be using them again. and certainly do not recommend their service to anyone else.   from a very disappointed customer
335|"NPower Gas and Electricity Dual Fuel like to portray themselves as honest, moral fair and customer caring in their advertising but when Npower made a serious mistake and took my gas supply from another supplier without my permission, resulting in huge financial implications, I soon found out that NPower complaints dpt are up there with the worst of  the soulless energy corporations as they have sought to cover up mistakes and wriggle out of promises in order to avoid taking on the financial responsibility to fix their mistake in a fair way. They have chosen to pass much of cost onto a helpless consumer, in this case me.  Npower know that most consumers don't have the time, energy or money to pursue them in the courts so to some extent they can bully us into accepting their terms with impunity. Having gone through the painful process of escalating my complaint through their cold faceless and non aptly named customer care department, I feel my only recourse is to expose NPower online and warn other consumers to beware.  So this is what happened:   I originally subscribed to EDF Energy for my dual fuel needs about a couple of years ago.   However just over a year ago I started receiving mail to my address from NPower. However it was not in my name, it was addressed to a Mr A Dye so initially I did not open them assuming they were for a previous tenant.   After a several months of receiving these letters and not receiving any from EDF I contacted EDF to find out why I had not been receiving any bills. They did not recognise my details and claimed I was not a customer.   Shocked, I decided to open one of the Npower letters to find out to my distress that it was a final notice bill threatening to send the bailiffs around to break into my premises to cut me off.   Naturally I called NPower's customer care line and complained. After about an hour of waiting on the phone for them to find out what had happened, I was told that the problem had been solved. I was in effect the victim of an erroneous transfer. In fact there has never been MR A Dye living at my property. I was told that this would be resolved that day and that my supply would be restored immediately to EDF. I was also told that since there had been a significant accumulation of expense accumulated on the bill during the period of the erroneous transfer, that this expense would be entirely paid for by NPower, in acknowledgement of their mistake and the fact that bill had now grow too large for me to cover since I had not made gradual allowance for it as one normally would and I had changed flatmates several times during the period so it would be too late for me to claim their contribution.   I wish I could say that was the last letter from NPower to Mr A Dye at my address, and the last call I would have to make. Over the course the next year, the letters kept coming, each time with frighteningly increasing bill sizes, well into the thousands. I must have made about 10 complaint calls, each time I screamed for the issue to be resolved and requested reassurance that I would never become liable for this spiralling bill that was not even in my name. Even if I'd had the money and wanted to pay, I could not as I did not have a contract with NPower so they could not accept my payment. Each time, the NPower customer care representative assured me that the invoice value would be written off as NPower's loss, and therefore would not be carried back to the original supplier when my account was eventually returned.   Now, over a year later, I have been told that my Electricity supply has finally been restored to EDF, however so has the enormous balance over GBP600 which has accumulated because of the incompetence of NPower, and in stark contrast to the assurances I was given throughout the process. I have pointed this out to NPower and they are now claiming that their representatives had been in error when they had promised to cover the bill. At one point they even tried to make out that they only promised that NPower would not invoice me, not that they wouldn't pass the expense on to EDF who would. This is a dishonest and surreptitious attempt to wriggle out. A poultry ""good will"" offer of GBP150 was offered to shut me up on condition that I demurely knuckle down and don't pursue my claim any further. More bullying! This is their final offer and have advised me to go to the Ombudsman or through the courts if I'm not happy with. I tried to call the person the signatory of the letter, Head of Customer Relations on many occasions but unsurprising she refused to take my calls and responsibility for her decisions, instead appointing in each case some unfortunate lackey to take her place and shield her from accountability. I'll try the ombudsman but honestly I don't have the money or energy to go to court, and I suspect that NPower could defend their position from a legal perspective. But what about the moral perspective. In my most recent conversation with NPower I put one final question to them for which I have requested a reply in writing:  ""NPower please can you give me a specific reason why you think it is acceptable to go back on your word and not stand by the promises your representatives made?""  So far I haven't received a satisfactory reply. Instead they are hiding behind carefully chosen words apologising for a misscommunication without actually admitting to the fact that they did verbally agree to cover all the costs.  Thank you for reading.   Defeated consumer  London "
336|Total rip off, they more than doubled my bill from GBP105 a month dual fuel to GBP224 a month. I would not recommend this company to anyone. My new supplier said that is the type of bill you would expect to pay for a 4-5 bedroom house not a 3 bedroom, and even then it would still be a bit expensive.  I would encourage anyone still using NPower to change over to a new supplier as soon as possible, because if they haven't put your bill up yet then they soon will. I wouldn't even give them 1 star. 
337|wrong billing,and very complicated trying to leave.
338|Personally I got my final bill from NPower when I moved out of my property which I paid. They then threatened to take me to court for not paying and a day later I got a cheque back for GBP15 shy of the GBP137 i had just paid them. Now they're asking again for GBP102???!!!!In a word......... Incompetent!!!
339|NPower have managed to get me to sign a contract with them by all sort of promises.A year later they double and then quodrouple their prices without notifying me. I eventually received massive bills. When I changed my supplier they still sent me bills and threats of intended litigation if these bills are not paid.
340|after reading others comments it seems we are not the only ones disatasfied with NPower service..for a second bill running we are threatened with being cut off but how are you supposed to pay your bills when you never get one..i have just paid up 720 quid they racked up after canceling our direct debit without realising now to recieve a threat of you will be in court if you dont pay this money..i find it hard to understand that we never recieve bills but the threats..as a company they leave alot to be desired and as soon as i can i am changing and everyone elsr should to,there customer service is also the poorest i have ever known..when we changed we were told we could save money in fact it has cost us over 300 a year more.. useless..
341|My experience began Jan 09.  Moved into a house with pre-pay meter.  Pre-pay meter is possessed by the devil and is taking a huge portion out of our payments for a 'debt' (we have just moved in, we have no debt with NPower).  We speak to NPower over the phone and they tell us the last resident left with debts which we are being forced to pay off, if we keep receipts we will be reimbursed, man is coming to change meter'.  After pumping huge sums into it (whilst a huge amount is taken off the card as soon as it is loaded into the prepay meter) for a month or two we get back in touch.  We are told they dont know what we are talking about, we will get a little credit on our meter, but they refuse to acknowledge that we paid someone elses debt, Man comes to replace meter.  We begin paying direct debit GBP93 a month gas and electric.  This month (August) I moved out.  They sent me a letter just before I left, telling me I was GBP208 in credit.  I called, gave a forwarding address, said to take the closing payment from the credit (based on actual read) and send me a cheque.  I just got a BILL, they claim I owe them GBP22.  Im far too polite to say what they can do with their bill.
342|Worst ever provider. Can you please allow me to put NO STAR?!I moved into a flat and my landlord asked me to stick to NPower. Gave me a gas and electricity card when when I was using the meter. Never managed to set up a direct debit as they thought that I was using the card. They did not even believe me and send an enginerr to check my meters. But nothing was done. Fine, they did not want to charge me despite more than 30 times on the phone paying ridicilous call rates. Oh yeah they do have very polite customer service who does not know anything! Finally I gave up and then they started sending threatening mails.Then they told me that according to my meter serial code, I was not their customers. Great! But in the end they realised that they got the wrong meter number and I was their customer, they sent the worst ever threats. I called them and declared that I was fed up so just give me the bill and stop the rubbish. They posted a thick file without a stamp on it. Great that I have moved out of that ridicilous flat and my ex-landlady is still upset that I have annoyed NPower.
343|Like all the suppliers they wow you with how competitive they are at the start then once they have you reeled in that is it. I have had accounts with all of the leading suppliers and Npower is definately the worst. They send threatening letters even when you have paid your bills (their system apprantley takes up to 18 working days for online banking to clear?), their customer service department are rude and unhelpful and they are expesnive. So if you are thinking about changing to them - DON'T - I will be changing supplier in then next month when i move out and i don't ever want to hear their name again.
344|If it were an option, I would have given NO stars to npower.I switched to npower a year ago to cap my energy prices. They set my direct debit payments at GBP26 per month based on previous history with British Gas and Southern Electric.  This July, I received a bill informing me that my new D.Debit would be GBP116.00 per month. This did not reflect a massive increase in prices - but allegedly the amount required to pay off the debt incurred.I e-mailed their Customer Service asking them to confirm the number of KwH of electricity I had used over the past year.  The figure they sent me was considerably higher than the meter readings I had supplied would suggest.I queried the figures and received another, very obscure e-mail, varying the D.Debit - but failing to address my question.I just KNOW in my bones that this one will run and run .... a prospect that I regard with dread because, like everybody else, I want a peaceful life with good service for a fair price.  I want simplicity and transparency from the Service Provider.I understand that projecting a payment amount for a direct debit is not an exact science - but I have never before encountered such haphazard and confusing practice from a major supplier.The replies from Customer Service take a few days to come through, but are always courteous.  Unfortunately they add another layer of obscurity each time.I would never recommend npower.  And look forward to being shot of them.  
345|good points nonebad points too much to write them all down but to start with well over priced customer service i dont think they heard of and i had a prepayment card  which i ended 6 month ago then i get a letter from npower saying i owe 64 pounds and further action will be taken can any one explain how you can owe money with a prepayment card i had no debt on the machine before i changed supplier and no minimum contract   
346|I am really pleased  with the service and support from NPower since switching recently.  The staff at the support centre were very knowledgable and dealt with issues with ease.  My previous supplier couldn't give me a reliable answer - one member of staff would say one thing and then not take action as did several more - previous supplier support was hopeless and n-power is refreshing.
347|recived my npower bill i had 89.32 credit, when i asked for it back i was told it was a error, on my bill two months ahead had been added npower were not helpful at all
348|NPower are the worst supplier I have ever used. After paying a bill in full , I sent the reading two weeks later and they  sent me a letter telling me that they had power to enter my property and remove any valuable in order to make up for the difference in value of the bill. I have never seen anything like these! They are absolutely awful. Never use Npower!!!!
349|I have been with N Power since 2003 and was on dd for my gas and electric and paid  GBP87.00 per month - we received a bill at the end of the winter 2009 and we owed them  GBP209.00 and there was another dd that was not registered on my acc so the balance would have been  GBP209.00 - the  GBP87 - and o my horror they wanted to increase my dd to  GBP147.00 per month ! I called them and explained would pay the full balance off the acc , however would they keep my dd at  GBP87 and was told no ! I could pay the  GBP209.00 and then all future payments would be at  GBP147.00 per month, I cancelled my dd and asked to speak to a manager and told that there was no one available for me to speak to, so now I have gone to another supplier.
350|I have made the biggest mistake in joining npower last year.My bill shave gone up 3 fold and they keep sending threast as a way of snding me my bills.I had to carry out my own meter reading as their were estimates.I then received 3 new bills in a matter of days all varying amounts.I want to leave and have contacted my old suppliers.I wrote to npower telling them I will pay them off a certian amount each month and I am leaving them.They have threatened to block my move back to my old suppliers as well as suggesting I get a prepayment meter which I have never had in my life and have heard nothing but appalling stories about.I have just filled out an online complaints with the ombudsman.I will have to wait and see if the ombudsman will do antging to help get npower away from me.
351|NPower is a  good company and service
352|I am not an NPower Customer, but I recieved a notice from them saying they supplied me the electricity between 2003 & 2007. During this period a) only live few months at that property, and b) The supplier was British GAS. The new notice I received from Npower claims GBP1400.00 . I am now seeking British Gas' assistance in combating this NutPower(NPower).Will keep you all posted.
353|Npower are apalling - I had an account with them and moved house - they told me I wouldn't receive a bill for a month and would write to me to confirm the amount - however before doing this they took over  GBP104.00 from my account with no notice what so ever. Costing me bank charges. They now claim they wrote to me, but they didn't and I even have documentary evidence of this becuase they wrote to my old address stating they didn't have a forwarding address for me- so I find it hard to understand how they could send me a bill when they didn't have my address- although I did give it to them. The administration is apalling. I have now incurred charges and they claim they have done nothing wrong. I don't get a response from a person just an automed response and they are really rude. The administration is the worst - they can't provide a breakdown of the bill and have quite clearly overcharged me - they charged me an extra  GBP104.00 on top of my monthly  GBP42.00 even though I didn't have gas for over a week in february. Its crazy. I have requested information from them and they still have not supplied this. They have not provided me with a full statement of account which I have been asking for for ages and they are awful to do business with. 
354|It  was for me the worst supplier I ever had. Far too many problems to be told here in just few minutes........I found them to have very poor customer care, it was very upsetting for me to deal with them. I found their advertising misleading and too many letters often in contradiction at your door......Just to tell you only one -  Once I received a final reminder without previously receiving any Bill at all, the reminder was also not correct  because asked me to pay much much more than the actual real consumption. After fighting very hard, I put things right ...
355|Got to be the worst electricity supplier I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  Customer service is terrible and their prices are sky high!  They were constantly getting my bills wrong (too high) even after I was giving them regular meter readings and would take a long battle on the telephone numerous times to try and get it fixed.  When I tried to change to another supplier they made it as difficult as possible for me by refusing to allow the transfer stating unpaid bill yet there was no unpaid bill I was in credit.  Currently going through my third attempt to switch to another supplier now!I would recommend caution if your thinking of going with npower as once your in its a long and difficult fight to get out which I can assure you you will want out!  I know of a number of people who have experienced this treatment from npower.
356|nPower is one of the few service providers that have impressed me with their customer service, and the only review I've ever actually got off my bum and written! Excellent customer service. Answer calls quickly and always incredibly friendly.Offer annual  GBP80 discount on dual fuel
357|I moved house in October last year, and it took three phone calls and a letter later for NPower to stop charging for my gas and electricity in my old house AS WELL as in my new house. I have recently left them for a cheaper deal with Scottish Power and today, at 9 months pregnant and asleep on the sofa, I was rudely awakened by two representatives peering through the window at me and knocking at the door. I found them rude and struggled to get them to leave, even though I explained I needed to go and lie down again.
358|Used uswitch to get to NPOWER in May after our fixed deal was coming to an end with Scottish power. Now into August and 3 phone calls later plus 2 meter readings and npower still haven't set up an account. They can't even tell me what deal we are supposed to be on. Would go back to scottish power but most fixed price deals have ended. Will now have to wait until the middle of September to have account fully up and running - over 4 months to set up an account and direct debit. Not a life enhancing experience.
359|I have switched from N Power to another electric supplier in April 2008. I was billed in May, and I have contacted Npower about it. And now in July, I have received yet another bill for  GBP131.63, after my current supplier, twice gave them my meter readings. What's the deal here?
360|I tried to leave npower as soon as I moved into a property that was supplied by them. They overbilled me, insisting on using an estimated reading, despite me phoning through the correct readings 3 times. A representative was sent round from head office to try to persuade me to stay with them. Within a week of me disputing the bill, they instructed a debt collection company who immediately issued letters. When I finally got through to someone on the phone still nothing was done about it. I do not recommend N power.
361|"N Power has been very poor overall, I'm returning to British gas , they increased prices by 20% after 2 months then underestimated our gas so we didn't notice difference at first, but this meant when we tried to leave they charged the difference in the meter readings at the new rate so it cost  GBP300 which they demanded immediately, then after sending us a ""sorry your leaving letter"" told me I hadn't told them I wanted to leave, then when I tried to pay they told me I hadn't registered so couldn't pay until I had! Such poor customer service."
362|I signed up for the online tarrif with N Power for which there was an  GBP80 cashback but they moved me onto the standard high priced tarrif and refused to move me back.
363|I would recommend npower's pricing but would not recommend their billing and customer services. Signed up to npower in December 2007 and I have still not received a bill although I keep asking. I have been putting aside money for the bill but they don't seem to know how much I owe.  I have contacted EneryWatch to make a complaint.
364|We moved out of a property and gave N Power meter readings for gas and electricity 3 months later we had a bill for the old property for time we were not there.  I complained on the telephone and asked if I should put it in writing but was told no as I would be contacted in 2 weeks.  I was then sent CCJ letters threatening to take us to court so I put my complaint in writing, still had no response to my letter but received more CCJ letters.  I then telephoned and went through the whole conversation again and they claimed not to have my meter readings which I gave countless times (including in writing). They now say the bills they gave me were estimated and for a time after the period when we left.  They say they will recalculated and get back to me in June with an 'actual proper bill', which will then be 7 months after we left the property.
365|I moved to N Power 6 months ago and I am still receiving wrong bills (for a wrong meter serial number). I have been trying to contact them for 2 weeks (via website and phone) and I am still waiiting for them to solve the problem
366|I decided too leave NPOWER as they had a price increase that would of increased my bill by GBP12.00 per month they put up my direct debit by  'GBP12.00 per month the exact time as their price increase. I phoned them with my correct last reading after receiving their final bill 3 weeks after joining my new suppler, as instead of asking my new supplier for my correct reading they sent me an over estimated bill instead to the tune of  'GBP50.00,  I was transfered to a woman I gave her my reading then she put me on hold which I thought was not necessary as she only needed my reading then after a while she spoke to me saying she had given my reading in which she could of easily done without leaving me hanging on the line then over a week later I got a letter from my new supplier with NPOWERS totally estimated reading on it they had not come to take the final reading on my new supplier date so I took it myself and gave it to my new supplier online. Before leaving NPOWER I asked NPOWER should I phone them with my final reading on the start date with my new supplier before the transfer. They told me it would not be necessary I only had to give it to my new supplier and they would ask them for it but instead of asking them for my reading they gave them my over estimated reading instead well I am still waiting for my GBP50 refund which I overpaid to NPOWER but I am not sure just if I am actually going to get it without a long wait the way they are going. 
367|After moving in to this address a year ago the reading dude read the two reading the wrong way round, so at night i was paying the day rate and vice versa, they admitted blame and a month later i am still waiting for reimbursement from a year of overcharging...time will tell....have moved to EDF now.
368|"1. Never answered any of my customer queries despite being told ""please contact us we are happy to help""2. Hopeless people on end of line that cannot tell you anything about your own account!! I got told ""no one could help me with this matter at present and to e-mail"". Which i did (see point 1)3. Recently increased prices and as this occurred mid way through a quarter they just estimated the reading when the the increase took place and charged the higher rate after that. In actual fact they underestimated the reading so I have been paying higher rate for gas that I had used before the price hike!!!!!!"
369|Had a good service over the years but the last year I have had inflated bills after a meter change and NTL seem very reluctant to change the meter. Even on a last year comparison they must realize that the meter is running fast and a three month usage increase of 300% in units especially when you have been on holiday for three weeks in that three months,is a bit much. Looks like I will be changing my suppler 
370|No good points I think they are the worst for both gas and electric and very un helpfull. They do not reply to your letters.
371|My advice is do not use this comapny and this is why. NPower where suppling our scout group with electricity for our scout hut, which is used for around 5 hours per week, wtih the only electric required been for the lights. They managed to estimate a quarterly bill for about  'GBP850, (normally it is  'GBP80 max), when our treasurer who is an eldery lady rang up to tell them that she thought they had made a mistake, they revised their bill and issued a credit note and a new invoice which was paid imeediately. But the credit note was issued for the wrong amount, so our treasurer rang back and Npower said that the credit note was not actually a credit note, but a credit against the account, and so the balance of the orginal invoice and the credit note was still outstanding. Npower advised our treasurer to put the complaint in writing with copies of the bill & credit note to inform them what had happened. She did this, then about a week later received a letter from a debt collection agency demanding the money, stating legal proceedures would start if she did not pay. She phoned NPower straight away and was told that they had not recieved her letter (even though it was sent by recorded delivery and they signed for it) she had to pay or she would be taken to court and obtain a poor credit rating). Our treasurer has now resigned after 15 years service due to all the stress this has caused. After I took over, I tried to get all of this across over the phone by but the operators kept telling me that there was money outstanding and we had to pay. I wrote to Npower explaining the situation and finally after 14 months they have agreed that nothing is outstanding. 
372|just changed to N power, friendly salesmen, efficient sevice so far and great freebies!!!
373|"after having spoken to NP to arrange payment by their weekley payments scheme, i was told i would recieve a card and a payment plan in the post. after having waited 1 month for the said mail, i proceeded to ring NP once every fortnight, only to be told it is ""pending"". 3 months later, i recieve a letter informing me as i have failed to pay my bills, i was to be cut off with a GBP500 reconection charge, payable only once my account was cleared!! having rang them up again, i was told there was nothing they could do to help.Poor customer service."
374|Dont be silly and go with n power. Charging me twice for a debt and its been 2 years since they tried to charge me GBP1009 for 3 months gas all though I was on a pay as you go meter ??????still not sorted it out yet and i'm paying GBP15 a week just on department.
375|N Power is a good service provider, that has been established for years, as far as I can remember.  Although they are a little on the pricey side, they are a good company to deal with, and have many deals on offer to offer their customers.  Their customer service is also good.
376|I will switch from this supplier at some point this year.
377|Billing - dreadful. Customer ??? service I don't think so.
378|I've been with N Power more years than I remember and they've always been helpful. I've always stuck with N Power, even when I've moved because it's a company I can trust and rely on.
379|If N Power make a mistake by not charging you on monthly basis, then rather than accepting their mistake, they will charge you for the whole cycle which become a bulk amount. This is ridiculous. The service is very poor and the company is not a customer oriented company.
380|I recently moved house and my  new electricity supplier is N power. I contacted them as soon as I moved in with my meter reading and gave them all my new details, ie name and date moved to the property. I received a letter with my name incorrectly spelt so I tried to contact them to advise them of the correct spelling but found it very difficult to get through on the phone, there were various menus and when I thought I had got through to the correct department I was told I needed to ring another number. I eventually got through but was told that all the advisor were busy but I could leave my name and number and someone would get back to me. No one ever did. My house had economy 7 storage heaters which I have had removed to have gas central heating installed. I contacted N power to have my meter changed from economy 7 to a standard charge meter, they informed me that this could be done but for another 3 weeks. I arranged an appointment and waited in all day for them to call. No one arrived so I rang N power, they stated that even though I had a letter from them confirming the appointment the booking had not been made properly so no one had been booked to come and change the meter, but they could book it properly for me and would call to change the meter in 2 weeks. In the meantime I wrote to the head of customer services to complain. I have not received a reply to this letter.  2 weeks went by and I waited in again, but this time by 11 am I was getting fed up so I rang N power who confirmed that my meter was booked in to be changed between 8 and 1 that day. By 1 pm still no one had arrived so I rang N power again and they confirmed it was definately booked but perhaps they were running late. I told them I was not prepared to wait in any longer so I was told they would contact me with a new appointment. When I told my husband what had happened he contacted them himself and arranged another appointment for a further 2 weeks away but this time they said because of them not turning up on 2 separate occasions we would receive GBP40 credit on our account.
381|Well, I got a letter from them saying they would start billing for supply on 27th sept 2006.By January 2007 I was on the phone to them wondering why no direct debits had been taken. British Gas had stopped taking DD back in September.By the end of Jan they managed to set up the Direct Debit they started (and had lost) back in September. They managed to take the first DD on 12th March.  Hoorray??!I also upped the DD amount (both gas and electric as I think their amount were too low and a ploy to run up major arrears).I phoned them with a meter reading in Feb, March & April.  I was promised my 6 monthly statement at the beginning of April.It is almost the end of April, no statement as promised.  They promise a supervisor phone call - I ring back to find he has gone on holiday!!They can't tell me the state of my account as it is due to ADMIN, a mysterious bunch that cannot be telephoned by them, or me! Everything takes at least an official 48 hrs (officially that is, in actuality nothing happens at all)Except preparation of a bill - that will officially take 28 days, oh and don't give them an up to date reading as that resets the 28day clock...I've foolishly given them another 7 days to merely provide me with an account so that I can see how much I've spent since September and budget accordingly.If they don't I'll cancel the DD forthwith and go back to British Gas as at least they can actually tell me how much they're charging me - even if it is exorbitant.
382|"Since changing to them from Sainsburys 8 months ago, I have had a number of problems.  Firstly, it took them ages to set up the account (they lost the paperwork), then they wrote to me a month after my first payment to them, saying that I had asked someone else to take over my gas, and they wouldn't be supplying me any more.  I explained I hadn't asked anyone to take over my energy supplies, but they insisted I must have, and gave me a number to ring, of the company who control the switching of power supplies and handle the requests to switch.  After a number of calls to this company (who told me N Power should be ringing them not me!) I was told they had no requests to switch.  I reported this back to N Power who told me this was incorrect, and they made me call the other company again.Eventually N Power admitted it was wrong - and I had not requested the account be moved (I wish I had now though)!In January my Gas Meter was read and I received a bill for around GBP1,000.  I rang to try to work out how (my annual bill isn't this big!), and I was told that the meter had been read and the money was due.My husband checked the meter reading and it was far less than that shown on their bill.  I rang them back and they agreed to amend this to our reading and said there must have been an ""input error"" by their reader.I received a letter saying my monthly gas amount was increasing from GBP33 to GBP69 from 1st February, and then back to GBP33 on 15th February (I still have this letter), but they have continued to take GBP69.When I rang them today, they said they didn't have a record of this letter.  My account is currently GBP39 in credit and they can not do anything to change the payment of GBP69 they are due to take on 1st March.  They have agreed to reduce my payments to GBP38 a month from April, and as I will be in credit they have offered that I can write to them for a refund!I have switched to British Gas this morning and cancelled the N Power Direct Debit.  I will of course pay them what I owe them, but I will not overpay them so I can apply for a refund!  To be honest, dealing with N Power is such hard work - nothing really follows logic."
383|Two phone calls into my newly inherited relationship with N Power, and they have already tried my patience, to the extent that I have told them I will be finding a new supplier. This is the second time I have left the N Power family. In the last hour alone I have had to endure the waiting time of 25 minutes whilst on hold, the provocative heavy breathing of a panicked call centre representative as she attempted to cancel my direct debit, and finally the realisation that they couldn't even set up the service they had messed up in the first place.  My experience replicates almost exactly those described in the other reviews on this site.
384|We moved into our property on 2nd June and contacted them (as the current supplier) the very same day to advise that we were the new occupiers, and to set up a monthly Direct Debit for GBP25 each, for gas and electric.  Four and a half months later we still haven't paid a penny.  We have contacted NPower by phone several times, and each time we are told it takes a while to activate the account.  We've had letters addressed to us by name, but also to the occupier, saying they will cut us off if we don't provide details. We sent a lengthy email earlier this week giving details of each letter and phone call in turn, and surprise surprise, we have had no response as yet. All we have had is an automated reply saying they have received our email, but due to the high volume of emails, they are unable to respond straight away.As nice as it is not to have paid for any energy, we are concerned they are one day going to suddenly jump on us for not paying when it is no fault of our own!  Basically their administration is terrible, and unless this is sorted soon we will be seeking a new supplier.
385|After visiting USwitch to find a cheaper energy supplier, I was pointed to N Power, who said they could reduce my monthly electricity bill from about GBP40 to GBP21, so I signed up. I've been with them for 3 months and paid GBP21 by direct debit twice.I received a letter from them today stating that if I continued to pay GBP21 a month, the figure they used to tempt me away from my previous provider, then I would soon be in arrears. They calculated that to cover the cost of my electricity, my direct debit would have to increase to GBP71 a month, but not to worry because they would take care of the bank bit... very funny.
386|After a number of years with N Power with little complaint, I have to report that their attitude lately to customers is very poor.  I received my end of year bill which showed a credit of GBP25, but at the same time they wanted to raise my direct debit by GBP7 each month.  The letter invited me to phone if I disagreed, which is what I did, but they simply refused and said that I had to pay the increased monthly amount.  So, they get to keep my money in their bank account! Sorry, but I'm not going to put up with this. I've cancelled the direct debit and I am in the process of changing suppliers.They are very inflexible, and seem to just want your money.
387|N Power are not particularly competitive, and they have made terrible billing errors involving adding me to the wrong account and billing me for the previous occupiers use.
388|I tried to switch from Southern Electric and British Gas to NPower via the uSwitch site. What a nightmare. I am now paying TWO companies for electricity because NPower are billing me for power supplied to a different house! And even though they acknolwedge the error they say it will take six weeks to sort this mess out and refund the money. After three months and dozens of letter and phone calls the supply of gas is still coming from British Gas. I wish I'd never started.
389|I set up with N power for both my gas and electric, I wanted to pay by direct debit but N power took ages to set it up (6 month) I contacted them and was told not to worry as they would just add a little onto my month direct debit to cover any arrears...My payments were GBP50 per month. all went well for about 24 months then suddenly my bank informed me that they had not paid my DD of GBP123 to N power,,(lack of funds) I was charged GBP25 for this.  I contacted N power who said a letter had been sent to me abourt the rise in monthly payments,, I'd had no such letter,, I told them I could not pay  such a high amount every month, they were rather nasty and said that they were going to cut off my supply. I pointed out the arrears were their fault not mine as they had set low payments, they knew the size of  my home and all about the heating and cooking facilities, eventually they agreed to me having pre payment meters put in taking GBP5 per week extra for money owed. It took almost 2 years to pay it back , as soon as it was I switched suppliers. Last week I had a rep from N power asking why I changed suppliers, so I told him straight that the service I had was appalling.
390|On the whole, I would rate Npower as one of the better utility suppliers. I have always been dealt with courteously when I have had reason to ring them. If you take dual fuel from them you get a discount and although their prices have gone up recently (they are not on their own), I am very happy with their service.
391|How can some one get an electricty bill for GBP330 from  N Power over a six week period.  I used to pay my previous supplier GBP25 a month and still be in credit at the end of the year.
392|I have just left Scottish Power due to their complete inability to communicate with me.  Despite repeated requests for information from them regarding my bills I did not receive any. If i did get a reply it  just stated an apology and left you with no further information. Eventually I ran out of patience and swopped to another company out of frustration.  Today I noticed that they have taken over GBP180 in payment for a final bill which I have had absolutely no notice off.  I know that the money was due to them but to take this amount with no notice is not acceptable.  I have contacted them about this and only received the usual trite apology and the statement that the bill was issued.  If that is the case why have I not received a bill from them since I joined them despite my constant requests and meter readings.  I would never use this company again and would suggest that others avoid unless they like being kept in the dark about their bills.
393|Oct 2014 I changed from Prepay to Credit meters - the new meters were installed in Nov 10th 2014.Both meters were set at zero(0)- Since then I have made 34 phone calls  and have not had a resolution to the problem.I got the ombudsman service involved in Jan 2015 who told me the problem would be resolved in 28 days (Mar 28th 2015). I have had absolutely no contact from Scottish Power in the whole of that time - except when I phone them.1 update from ombudsman - totally toothless.I have paid some money into a Scottish Power account  which has not been acknowledged and have not received a bill from them in 6 months.....As I am a 67 year old pensioner I am extremely worried about how much I owe them - they don't seem to care!!!!I need to close my account to be able to change to a provider with good service!!!Whatever you do - don't fall into the same trap....DO NOT USE SCOTTISH POWER AS YOUR PROVIDER....YOU WILL REGRET IT!
394|I have been trying to resolve a problem with my latest bill of GBP688 for three days to no avail,o way could we have accrued this amount,we are both pensioners and live in a bungalow. So no way could we have used this amount of electricity.we also had similar bill of nearly same amount Jan-April2014 but where Nieves and paid it.i would not reccomend Scottish power .
395|Over a relatively short period time...6 months....they made so many mistakes on my account. They sent out completely fictional bills and set up direct debits without my permission, one of which was for electricity that I pay by a pre payment meter!! The online complaints service just resulted in me having to repeat information over and over again...as with the phone service. Customer services obviously very poorly trained. No one there seems to know what they are doing and some are just plain rude. 6 weeks after raising a complaint and numerous promises of call backs that never materialised my complaint was still unresolved.  I have moved to a different company. BEWARE...they may be cheaper but you will spend HOURS on the phone trying to resolve their errors. 
396|one year now and I still have estimated bill . Very bad coustmer services.
397|Scottish Power is by far the worst power company I have come across. Slow and Clueless customer service. Not sure who the responsible director is but whoever it is needs to be replaced with a decent manager who has a clue.  They blame their systems for not issuing bills to me as though this has nothing to do with them and their communication is appalling. Nothing I can say that I like about them at all. God help you if you fall into their trap. Don't be fooled by the cheaper power, you will pay with stomach ulcers eventually. Comparison sites should put a red warning about this company on their webpages.
398|Started with scottish power in 2013, they never asked for meter readings they just set up a direct debit each month of GBP66 for my gas and elec. 2 years later i then decide to move and i gave s.power my final meter readings and this is what they asked. They then told me i owed them GBP142 for the last 3 months and that was from estimated readings? Even though id already payed feb and march by direct debit? Took weeks or arguing and in the end i gave up and paid it. I then emailed them this week as i am receive final demand bills from old tenant, and they are now saying they are my bills. Obviously not!! Worst gas and electric supplier ever!
399|This lot just give me hassle on a regular basis.....today I get an e mail saying they recently asked me to read my meter and I need to do it urgently or they will estimate my bill.They did not ask me to submit readings.....you can check all messages in your online account.........the usual fiction!!!!My meter was read on 19 February and my bill was paid.My online account clearly states my next bill is due on 20 May which is correct as SP require readings every 90 days.This is harassment I suspect generated by their computer which has a mind of its own.As an aside the Ombudsman ruled last September that I was due a full explanation of what they did wrong last year and they agreed to action this within a month......it is now just over 7 months and not even diddly squat.....CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NONE EXISTENT
400|Moved to a new build, have SP as the supplier! Had them when we moved into are last property as well! Ahhhhh! Phoned them to get the meter point reference number, which they said we can only give this to you if you set up account! Which is a lie, as we have contacted the SSE who own the pipe and they have supplied this to us in matter of minute! This is something they SSE don't do often but wasn't a problem form them! If the next property we hope to move to is anything to with Scottish power we will not move there as we don't wish to deal these idiots again! Use the at your own risk, you have been warned!
401|I recently decided to switch power supply to Scottish Power. 1st application gave me a monthly payment of approx GBP54. This was cancelled by them and they asked me to contact them which I did, only to be told that the original application was wrong and I received another but the price was GBP58 I asked why it had gone up and was told because original was calculated wrong (miss sold ?)I got a start date of 11th April and then an email today requesting meter reading. Logged onto my a/c only to find payment had gone up to GBP63 !!!Contacted them to ask why, they said because my previous supplier had provided them with accurate usage ! I asked what it was and was told, I checked my information that I had given them during my application and it was the same ! They are taking over my supply tomorrow, rather than 11th April. I cancelled it and have made a formal complaint. Misled on two occasions not good advert is it.I spent two hours online/ phone trying to sort their mess out and had to re register with my old supplier. So Scottish Power can rip me off for the next 3 weeks or so. Needless to say I will be taking this matter all the way.
402|I switched in August 2014, and still haven't had a refund of the credit (GBP200ish) I am in. They even continued to take direct debits until I stopped it at the bank.They still send me estimated bills despite they no longer supply me!I've got so many complaint case numbers for this one complaint, it's no wonder they can't sort anything out.I've had to complain to the ombudsman, and am hoping to get my money back at some point this year....
403|very nice at beginning.Promised lower bills almost doubled them in 4 months.customer service none, rude people, gave me deadlock letter straight away, only been with them 4 months.Make bills up, never sent me any, then a letter demanding 700 pound or they would get baliffs.please stay away at all costs not worth hassle   
404|Despite a switch away from Scottish Power on 19 Jan, they will not refund my GBP167 credit I have on the account.  Phone calls to them end up in auto disconnectionEmails just get same automated responseIs there anything that makes them stand out- Just there appalling service.  I would not use again, no matter how cheap the service was.
405|I changed my supplier at the beginning of October 2014 and have only just received my credit on the account. I decided to leave last year after a couple of attempts to contact them when I was kept hanging on the phone for literally hours, when eventually getting through they said they would have to transfer me which entailed another wait usually to be then cut off.I have raised a couple of complaint through their system which have never been resolved.They have finally started answering the phone a lot quicker but as usual despite the promises to resolve the issues they remain outstanding. It is about time the regulators started to have seem real teeth and star banning them from sale for 12 months not 12 days. I would not recommend this supplier to anyone.    
406|Hi, I used to be with Scottish power and I am now with a great company not only do they have great customer service and know how to look after their customers, I also saved GBP369. If you'd like to get away from the monsters give me a comment back :)
407|The worst electricity provider I came across to! Didn't send me my final bill for 6 months even though I called them at least 10 times and now I got an email asking to pay or I might face additional charges! What the hell???? 
408|DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND AVOID SCOTTISH POWER LIKE THE PLAGUE. I REGRET THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I CAN SAY THAT'S GOOD ABOUT THEM. OUR COMPLAINT DATES BACK TO JULY 2014 & THEY'VE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE IT.CAN YOU THINK OF ANY COMPANY WHO TAKES GBP174 FROM YOUR BANK ACCOUNT EACH MONTH VIA DIRECT DEBIT & YOU ARE UNABLE TO DISCUSS YOUR ACCOUNT WITH ANY MEMBER OF STAFF.?   Telephone ( if you don't mind waiting a long time ), E-mail,  Send courteous, polite, professional, 'Recorded Delivery' letters through the Post - YOU'LL GET NO REPLY OR RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. I've NEVER experienced such AWFUL customer service before.  SO TODAY ( 13th March 2015 ) I'VE GIVEN UP AND APPROACHED THE ENERGY OMBUDSMAN.WHAT A CONTRAST - Superb & professional in every way.  Of course it remains to be seen how they ultimately handle our complaint - but I'm optimistic about the Ombudsman's ability to deal fairly / justly with S.P. & to succeed in getting them to invoice our DUAL FUEL Account orrectly ( which is the main part of our problem with them ).  JOIN THEM AT YOUR PERIL !!
409|After having my Economy 7 meter changed to a standard one (arranged through them) it took SP six months to update my account, and possibly only then because I had involved the Ombudsman. During this time I was unable to sort out any bills or change supplier.Finally, thankfully, I am now with another supplier but SP seem incapable of sorting out my final bill. They are denying that they have received my final readings from my new supplier even though SP themselves actually sent them confirmation of the gas readings over a week ago??????Never ever would I use SP again, even if their prices were half that of the other suppliers.ps. Two tips:* If your account is well in credit but they won't refund, demand they reduce your direct debit (it's GBP10 pm minimum for both fuels). At least you can be using some of your credit to pay for your energy.* Do contact the Energy Ombudsman. They are very approachable, it's free, they do seem to galvanise suppliers into action and they may be instrumental in helping you get compensation if you are entitled to it. 
410|"I got gas put in, they were my electricity provider so I took out duel fuel with them...nightmare started.They said, for some reason the new system doesn't recognise my account but not to worry they would sort it and get back to me...at this point I hadn't paid my gas for 2mths, oh and that was after an hour plus on the phone. This was the pattern for the next 7mths.Their ombubsmen took over the case, heard nothing after I got a letter advising me I was in a dead lock situation. The big energy ombubsmen now has my case, I currently haven't paid gas for 13 month, I'm on the ""living wage"". The stress of it is be unimaginable. "
411|Scottish Power take your money for boiler cover but really don't like coming to service your boiler. Last year they missed an appointment booked with a 4 hour slot they decided to ring cancelling 10 minutes before the end of the slot. This year they have done even worse they cancelled with 15 minutes to the end of the slot rearranged another slot and did not even give me a phone call when they failed to come. When I rang them they admitted that the service had been cancelled 2 days earlier and no one bothered to tell us. Very clever Scottish power 3 appointments and 1 service completed . I am still waiting to see if they decide to get back to me to arrange a new slot . I made an official complaint which they said would be replied to in 10 days  20 days later still waiting. They must think that working people have lots of holidays to use on boiler service. Just to add insult to injury I have not had one apology and 3 months and counting late boiler service. Needless to say I am cancelling my Scottish Power cover.
412|Switched in Nov 2014.  Have only just managed to conclude the account and receive my refund - which was increasing each month even though Scottish Power had ceased to supply, they continued to take my direct debit as the account had not been finalised.Hopeless customer service - frequently unable to get trough on the phone / five days or more for an online repsonse
413|We are new customers beginning to think big mistake. Customer service is non existent constantly waiting on phone to speak to someone. I know it's spanish owned but we are not in Spain where everything is tomorrow.
414|I received my normal energy bill and attempted to pay on-line, unfortunately my payment was rejected, after a second attempt I decided to leave it for another day as time was short.  However, the same thing happend the next two occasions so I reluctantly entered another card's details, the outcome the same 'unable to process payment'.  I then received a reminder that the bill was unpaid and I again tried to pay on-line and when this did not work for any of my visa or credit cards (5 in total) I tried calling customer services....well, after a 15 minute wait the line went dead as the music stopped, I thought I had been cut off so hung up and tried again.  After about 10 minutes the same thing happened. I decided to try and pay using the automated telephone payment and guess what, neither debit or credit card payments were successful! I then received a final demand with a threat of an admin charge if not paid withhin 7 days (letter arrived on Fri 6th Feb). On Monday (today) I tried again online, no success, telephone payment, no success and tried customer services; after 20 minutes line went dead but this time I waited and about 30 seconds of scilence was followed by the music again (is this a ploy to get people to hang up as I had done initially?).  I waited for 45 mins and 43 seconds (my phone has a counter on it) before at last it was answered! The service agent was appologetic and said he would take payment over the phone; guess what, payment rejected again for both visa and debit cards!!  All cards are valid and have/are used regulary without issue other than with ScottishPower. The sales person was polite and apologetic and said all he could do was 'feeze my account' to ensure I was not charged an admin fee, this would allow mw 30 days to pay - I asked how I could pay and he suggested by cheque (which I don't have); he opined that the account would be reset after 5 days and hopefully the problem will be resolved!  Sorry Scottish Power, I have wasted far too much time over this, I will pay my bill with cash at the PO tomorrow despite the inconvenience but I will be taking my custom elsewhere as 45 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered is totally unacceptable especially when I selected 'new customer' and the phone was remarkably answered within 2 rings!  Your sales person refused however, to transfer me to customer services because I was an existing customer! Rant over, contract over!! 
415|"I had my meter changed 5 months ago and they where supposed to switch me to a single rate rather than economy 7 rate, they have been unable to do this, they have continued billing me on estimated bills economy 7 rate despite many phone calls and emails. My account is 500 pound in credit but because they have not updated my account I cannot have a refund yet they can give me no explanation or date when this will be sorted out in fact they just repeat the same ""it's being investigated and we'll get back to you"" rubbish they tell everyone. No one is available when you ring who can actually help you with your issue as apparently they are the back room staff who don't talk to customers conveniently. Never use this company!!!"
416|Messed up when first transferred meter readings wrong way round, took 5 months to get it right. Changed tariff should of been easy process NO now have 3 accounts open??? Can never get through 45minute wait normal. Promised call back 10-15mins later when advisor had sorted my problem still waiting 5days later and problem not sorted! Would never recommend!!
417|poor overall experience - the website doesn't let you input your usage figures - then you have to speak to an incompetent customer service clown - only to be told that the website has a glitch, but the clown will take your details and add them to your account.   10 days later - guess what - only the electric readings have been added.   trying to speak to customer services is like banging your head against a brick wall - they just don't care , they are not interested in fixing this website problem - it has been going on for months - please read some other reviews about others who have these same problems.  SAVE YOURSELVES A TON OF BOTHER AND FRUSTRATION and go to the usual companies BG etc .   
418|Absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with.Customer services do not respond to emails, not once, telephoning them gets you an operative that can't do anything, multiple times, and refers you to the back office who never follow up.I ended up settling a bill I never received just to avoid a bad credit rating. A letter of complaint sent post the payment remains ignored.
419|14 days and still no heating, paying for a contract that we were told we would get same or next day service, we are now into day 14 with a small child and still no heating or hot water. No one to turn to no one to help we are at our wits end, promised to come out today no show. DONT USE THIS COMPANY AND GET INTO THIS SITUATION IT IS TERRIBLE THEY DONT CARE THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT TAKING YOUR MONEYWHY DONT THEY HELP US 
420|"My husband and I have switched to another utility company and have been trying to get a GBP400 refund from Scottish a Power for two months.  Every ""customer service"" representative with whom we speak gives us a different story.  Now they are telling us that we are still getting our electricity through them.  We are pensioners with very limited income, and without the refund they owe us, our Christmas in one week's time is going to be sadly affected by this company's unwillingness to give back what is ours.  I do believe that Dickens' Circumlocution office is located at Scottish Power.  If anyone knows a way to get through to these people, we would like to know the answer."
421|I was previously a Scottish Power customer a stopped using them in March 2014.  Account was closed and direct debit cancelled.  And to my surprise Scottish Power on 28th November, has taken GBP60 out of my bank account via a new direct debit, that I knew nothing about. Got a call back from their customer services who didn't have a clue. They looked into it and didn't have an explanation why it had happened. And if I didn't want to wait 10 days to get the money back I had to go to my bank and get them to claim the money back. I am pretty speechless, and angry.
422|Horrendous serviceHorrendous PricesHorrendous companyUtility companies are pretty bad at the best of times, but they are the worst
423|Having been with Scottish Power for several years, I always had a good opinion about the service they provided - until recently! All I needed to do was to contact them to update our personal details. I tried 5 times on my lunch hour in work and still I couldnt get through. I looked on there website (having an online account with them I thought it would be easy to change some details) however the details I needed to change meant I needed to speak to someone on the phone. Working full time and having a family it can be a bit tricky to contact them when its not a busy period. In total I have spent 4 hours on hold waiting to speak to someone - still I have not spoken to Scottish Power to change my details. I was told to contact them using the New Customer phone line - you do get to speak to someone - much quicker but they couldnt help me! So frustrated! 
424|Shambolic company with no clue in regards to customer service, and will keep hold of any money which may be owed to you, four months and ongoing for me to try and get a credit refubd, disgusting. 
425|Basically they created a bill with a false reading and the associated bill of over GBP1200 (+GBP200 that I have already paid in extra). They use the estimated value they made as an actual value. I sent them multiple mails (no answer). They phoned me asking to pay. I've made a video on the website showing my meter reading. They should know I would notice they lied on the reading they made(they want to make me believe I use more than 7376.41kWh a month).
426|I was on hold for 83 minutes yesterday and then when finally got through, the service advisor said he couldn't help until he had made some 'investigations' and that he would call me back the next day. NO CALL. now I've been on hold twice only to be cut off. My billing is incorrect and I am unable to fix it, or leave this TERRIBLE COMPANY - do not join!
427|I have been naive enough to subscribe to them because I moved house with SP as supplier. I been offered Platinum fixed rate that includes Home Care Premium. To save a headache organizing boiler cover, I take the offer. I know it wasnt the cheapest but I thought if I pay cover with BG, it roughly almost the same. However after a year I enquiries for annual services on the boiler, but they cant give me date on when it is going to be done. I have been waited for two months and a few more calls. Every time I called they said they going to open a case but the next phone call, they said the same. It just getting worse until I encounter a woman from the Home Comfort service who said I just need to wait, she doesnt know how long it will take and besides I shouldnt expect it quickly because I didnt pay for the service. It is the most insulting customer service I ever received as it clearly stated on the leaflet that being a Platinum customer I paid GBP85 a year for the service included on my rate. To make matter worse when I rang the SP number on their bill, they refuse to deal with my complaint as it is the Home Comfort matter. I questioned them because I was sold the product by the SP sales team and if the general enquiries number refuse to deal with, surely they arent fit to sold the product at the first place. I paid extra for nothing basically and I dread to think what the service look like if I had a boiler breakdown. I made two complaints and both are not being dealt with. They only gave you complaint number without any follow up.I also have problem with billing, they are very quick to raise your direct debit. A year with them, I paid double than what I was quoted at the first place. When they have no need to raise your direct debit because you have been ripped off, they wont provide you with any bills. I always enter my reading at the end of the month. They had a guy come around doing the meter reading on the 14 Oct 2014. My online account said that the next bill date is going to be 18 Oct 2014. I entered myself a meter reading on the 17 Oct 2014. The date passed without any bill and they have changed it that my next will would be on January 2014. It is very unfair to expect customer paid every month when they cant provide bill every month, not even quarterly. Do not sign up to them if you expect to have monthly bill and good customer service. You have to be the one who chasing them about issues and you are lucky if they dealt with it. Never ever subscribe yourself to Platinum fixed rate or taking their Home Comfort services
428|Stay away from Scottish Power. We have made two complaints. One is regarding our previous flat; we closed our account in July and they continue sending bills to our current address and charging for gas we do not use. Another one made today; Unfortunately our building company sent our initial gas and electricity readings to them and we have not received any welcome package yet (from July)I have tried to contact them every day and they put me on hold for more than 40 mins and nobody answers. I do not know what to do. I want to change supplier immediately but how can I contact them? I sent a mail but I doubt if they answer me
429|I got a job through a recruitment agency with SP in Glasgow, the training was diabolical to say the least, 2 PC's were working out of a team of 12 people so we had to watch the trainer go through the databases and statistics, I'm a hands on learner, watching and listening someone else working on a PC screen is not for me.I was dismissed, as I was put onto Customers with extremely poor training, and kept having to ask colleagues for advice, in which I got a very cold response, they seem very cliquish and the ideology of Team Work is just not there, plus I was shadowing with an Advisor called, who I found really patronising and rude.Please just avoid this place employment wise, at all costs.
430|Despite telephone calls and e-mails I am still unable to leave this company.A company to avoid at all costs.
431|I have been trying to get a refund of over GBP1200 since January.  You can never get through on the phone hanging on for up to an hour and then getting cut off.  If you send an email you get an automated response that they will respond within 5 days but they never do.   Even if you make a complaint it doesn't get you anyway.  They promise to send you statements that never turn up.  When you do get statements it's impossible to understand.  I received a part refund in August and then an email in September telling me the remainder was being sent.  I haven't received this and they now tell me that the email was incorrect and that they paid me the full refund in August.  When I asked for this in writing they said they can't do that!  I have closed my account with them and would warn anyone thinking of using them to reconsider.  They are by far the worst company I have ever dealt with - totally useless and I can't understand how the regulators allow this.
432|I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD ONE HOUR AND TEN MINS TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE RE. INCORRECT BILL. STILL WAITING......
433|So today i tried to pay my bill using their 'easy to use 24 hour automated service' (their words not mine).  However the first time i called it said we can not retireve your account details.  Now it keeps transferring me to the emergency hotline for a gas emergency!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously how hard is it to pay a bill....apparently very if your energy supplier is Scottish Power.
434|I have an online account and I have set up an online account for my 88 year old father in law. I have used the same e-mail address, which was fine at the start. But 12 months ago I could only access online my account. I was told there was a system fault that they were looking it, 12 months later I still cannot access his account online. I am now trying to contact their customer service, I have waited in a queue for 50 minutes.waste of time AVOID
435|Avoid this company at all cost, I have had a faulty meter since I bought a property six months ago, after hours of being on hold, calling for days/weeks, emails, tweets, facebook & written letter they have still done nothing while charging me three to four times more than they should be by direct debit as to what im actually using & they have still done nothing, matter now in the hands of the ombudsman, I have never dealt with such a shocking company, its a wonder they have any customers left, I for one will be moving supplier as soon as I can
436|There is no contact with them whatsoever. I switched to them looking for cheaper prices but I couldn't submit my meter readings because their website wasn't working for months! I left them after 2 weeks being with them (well started to because we all know how long it takes to switch)! HORRIBLE! THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL! 
437|I was amazed to discover that if you are in credit when you switch from Scottish Power, they often hold on to your credit balance and don't tell you about it.I switched from them several months ago, and only when I heard about this practice the other day and emailed Scottish Power about it did they admit they still had GBP78 of my money which (only because I asked) they would now return.No doubt they are holding onto money from tens of thousands of ex-customers of theirs without refunding them or telling them!I am amazed this is legal. It is absolutely unethical.
438|I had a number of problems regarding the billing sent by this company. I used a comparison website to compare prices and Scottish Power appeared to be the cheapest. After a couple of months my bills doubled. I contacted the company and got a very negative response on the occasions they bothered to reply. I would consider your options very carefully before using this company.
439|They took over my gas amd electric woth out me knowing only found out when i lost my edf gas card, left me with out gas for 48hours cistomer service is shocking wher on the phone for over 4hours still nothing thy told me that i they have been my supplier for over a month didnt send a key amd card i had a 4 year old in the house freezing cold and they didnt give a rubbish now it takes 5weeks to go back to edf stay well away from them nothin but trouble! 
440|They took over my gas amd electric woth out me knowing only found out when i lost my edf gas card, left me with out gas for 48hours cistomer service is shocking wher on the phone for over 4hours still nothing thy told me that i they have been my supplier for over a month didnt send a key amd card i had a 4 year old in the house freezing cold and they didnt give a rubbish now it takes 5weeks to go back to edf stay well away from them nothin but trouble! 
441|Please do not go to Scottish power. I have had nothing but trouble with them. It takes hours to get through on the phone to them. They never email back and i have been promised endless amounts of call back after the estimated my use across three days of gas and electric to be GBP657.54. Its absolutely ridiculous and i still have not had it recalculated a month later. But today received a letter from a debt company saying i now owe over GBP200 on a house that i moved out of over a year and a half ago and closed the account for as i was straight. 
442|RUN A MILE FROM SCOTTISH POWER! The moment I registered my contact details with them I regretted it. They started by continually calling me saying I could open an account with them then cancel it within 7 days at no cost. This sounded like my only way to end this phone conversation and I concluded they could be better so I'll open the account then research Scottish Power and the rates I would be offered. After researching them to find out about their appalling reviews and rates offered worse then what I had been currently offered so I called and cancelled my account within the call off period. To which the operator confirmed it was cancelled. I have since received an email from them at random ever few months suggesting I was still a customer. Each time I would call them to confirm I was no longer a client of there's to which they confirmed however I continued to receive emails then a few random payments off my credit card. Scottish power are not returning my emails and not resolving the issue. BE AWARE! Don't give them any of your details! 
443|I took over a house supplied by Scottish Power so I decided to keep them as the supplier. After about half and hour on the phone I thought everything was set up and expected a contract and details of how to logon online to be sent to me. Online access is important as I am overseas. Instead, they sent me two emails with click throughs which required me to log on. When I complained online that I had no password and no account number to generate a password they just sent an auto email with a password, no apology or explanation. They then sent a bill to my house saying 80 pounds was overdue from a date before I had even contacted them. Cannot access their website today and the queue for customer service is over twenty minutes - which I have to pay to call from overseas. From my experience and that of others posted online, they seem to have completely lost the plot. 
444|I have been with Scottish Power for a few years never had a problem. I have managed my account online and when I have had to call I've never had a problem. I was in credit and they transferred the money to my account I no time at all.My fixed rate has ended but not sure if I should move as other comments I have read about other companies worry me...
445|im curantly been on the phone one hour still no answer i have emailed you 23 times . please return my money . 
446|I thought I was going mad today...until I read everyone's experiences with Scottish power.I had a fixed tariff until February 2015 at GBP98 a month direct debit & always gave on time up to date meter readings but last month (july) they took out GBP177.00 I phoned & gave them another new reading they recalculated it to GBP122 a month but this month they have taken out GBP177.00 again. After spending most my day on the phone & only getting through once they have amended my payments to GBP95. I have no explanation to why it's gone up. Then told me they couldn't refund what they owe me because my bank had stopped the direct debit,soooo I phoned the bank & they said it was still active... I've tried to call them back & low & behold I can't get through. Also I went on line today to check my new direct debit amount & it says GBP89 per month & it will be coming out on the 21st August...thats GBP168 on the 4th August & GBP89 on the 21st Whhhatttt so I'm leaving them & cancelling my direct debit before they get any more of my money out of my account. If I took more money out of a account I would be prosecuted for it. 
447|Steer clear of this god awful company,it has been over two months since i have left my property and several phone calls about the over charging on our bill (and their estimating is awful and has no logic to it in three days we apparently used nearly GBP200 of energy which i don't think is physically possible) and no matter how many times i call to sort this out the bill it just gets higher! The amount of times we have tried and tired to get the bill holders name changed they say it has and what a surprise is hasn't and the same with our property number!AND! multiple time i have been on hold and finally get off hold to be hung up on straight away! What is that!?Stay away from this company if you want to have a life outside being on hold!
448|"After receiving a shocking final bill from them, I decided to ring the company which I did 4 times in total waiting 30 minutes each time. I NEVER RECEIVED A STATEMENT DURING MY CONTRACT, which they blamed on a ""system error"". Made a formal complaint about my issue, they didn't get back to me despite their promise to do so, so I called them and they offered to deduct a very small amount from the bill because there was a ""cheaper tariff"" (which they are supposed to call me about!). I argued that it was not enough, and then a customer service advisor proceeded to argue that the responsibility for the issue was 50-50, why not take 50% of the bill off then? Overall very disappointed, if I had the funds I would've took the issue further. Would not recommend this company."
449|Where do I begin 48 hours of phone calls mostly, no 90per cent on hold three failed engineer call outs who didn't call out then numerous times whilst on hold been cut of no one who really fulfilled a promise or knew what they were doing and one cancelled holiday due to not been able leave family  with no gas supply . Please please do not use scottish power first time ever needing help with gas and they repeatedly with style let us down . One very upset person who isn't going on holiday tomorrow someone has to be answerable to this 
450|Just call their freephone number and try contacting customer service. That should be enough to steer you away from this shambolic organisation. I had nearly GBP 400 overpaid on my account and trying to get a refund has taken me over ten frustrating phone calls without talking to a human, 4 emails and 2 letters by post. They offered an apology and GBP 20 compensation. They can stick that where the sun doesn't shine. I have numerous properties and will never ever consider these people again for the supply of my utilities. Absolutely disgusting customer service and relation. 
451|Fixed line tariff was ending August 31st. Rang SC to arrange new tariff when the problems started. We were informed whilst talking to customer services that the new tariff put us on a hugely reduced DD payment, so I queried our acc status, only to be told we were in credit to the tune of GBP250+ so I asked for a refund to our bank, it didn't happen. So emails, letters ignored, 'phone calls are simply unintelligible, (think about it!) 3 'phone calls made in a matter of days, 1st call we are in credit GBP250+, 2nd call we are in credit GBP265+ 3rd call we are in debit GBP350+ ??? Letter to CEO ignored, we are switching after years with SP. We've simply been ground down. You have been warned. If CEO replies now, it's too late.
452|"I stuck with SP for a couple of years, and in that time had to raise complaints on three separate occasions. Generally through lack of response from the customer services team or just following billing mistakes that they made. My final complaint was following switching to another provider, their final ""technical hiccup"" was to only cancel half of my duel fuel account, leaving both my current supplier billing me and SP taking payments 2 months after i had confirmed in writing that the switch had taken place.The complaints department are wholly ineffective it seems (probably too busy), never actually addressing the items detailed within the complaint itselfThree months on nearly and they have yet to refund my balance and they say its likely to be another month before they will do.. In my experience the worst energy provider I have ever been unfortunate to use."
453|Quite possibly the worst energy provider on the planet!!!  I am still in the process of joining Scottish power but as soon as that's complete Im moving on.  Trying to contact the call centre is nigh-on-impossible, average wait time is 45mins.  Booking a call back is a joke; there are never any slots available.  If you value your sanity don't choose Scottish power, trust me the 50 pounds you save is not worth the grief you have to deal with.  When you eventually get through the call centre staff are very apologetic, commenting that they do not have enough resource...interesting point for SP management!
454|Arranged to have my pre payment meters changed for a monthly direct debit meter before christmas 2013 didnt show up for the apointment so rearranged didnt turn up again 3 time was a charm but ! That was around February and after constant calls and always being told it will be sorted they still belive im on prepayment meter and wont set up a direct debit which also means I get no bills no idea of what iv used or what it cost and even after telling them this they still do nothing, I hope they read these reviews because if they belive im gonna pay a huge bill when they finally pull there fingers out they can jog on   
455|Don't, just don't consider them.Called up (45min on hold) to get some of my overpayments back, everything seemed fine and they said they'd transfer the money.Called back (30min on hold)  later and was told it hadn't been approved by the approvals team. I asked why I hadn't been contacted and they said they didn't know. Put in a complaint and asked for it to be put through again.Didn't get a call back about the complaint when they said I would.Called back later and was told it hadn't been approved, hadn't even been actioned by the approvals team.I asked for a copy of my notes and was told there would be a GBP10 fee (not sure this is legit under data protection).Usless, just useless
456|SP agreed via the ombudsman to a revised bill, GBP100 ex-gratia payment and a letter of apology. (This after over a year of telling SP the house they'd billed me for was empty.) SP have sent the old, incorrect bill minus GBP100 as a final demand! No ex-gratia payment, no letter of apology. AT ALL COSTS PLEASE - IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY - USE A DIFFERENT SUPPLIER!Worst company I have dealt with!
457|It is very nice firm who is creating a very best services for companies. They have a faithful staff which are ever-ready to help in your problem.  
458|I asked for a quote on energy prices seemed ok .  I  then find there taking money out of my account to pay someone else supply . Im still waiting my money back from them after being promised the money  on it way . Not happy . I RANG  scottish power but i am stood in a long line waiting to be answered . Not a good start to trust a supplier energy . SAFE TO SAY I shall not be using them .
459|I have spent months trying to get a final reading from this company. They never reply to emails. They promise to sort things out over the phone and NEVER do. They are trying to bill me for nearly GBP500 after I sold my house and it had been empty for months. I have pleaded for a final bill using the readings taken on the last day of sale which I (and my estate agent) took but they still keep sending estimates. Last month they said they would sort it out and send an accurate final bill but all I got was a letter from a debt collection agency! Unbelievable. They should be investigated for improper conduct and shut down. They are a complete disgrace. USE THEM AT YOUR PERIL.
460|I had a blazing row with them yesterday, our micro-business electricity 12 month contract was due to be renewed and when I called to negotiate the sales person offered us a 2 year contract at a reasonably competitive rate.Rather than rush into this I contacted Scottish-Hydro and got a 2 year contract quote from them which worked out only about GBP40 cheaper (annually).  As there was so little difference we decided to go with Scottish Power and save ourselves the hassle of changing supplier (which in our experience never goes smoothly). So we got the same person at Scottish Power back on the phone and signed up with them for the 2 years.When the paperwork came in yesterday we noticed they had changed our billing from 3 month direct debit to bill, to monthly direct debit subs  When I called to challenge this he admitted that was completely his error but would NOT change unless we paid a higher charge, taking us to GBP70 dearer than Scottish-Hydro, but of course we had already agreed to a 2 year contract now with Scottish Pow!!!   Next time I will go out of my way to give someone else the business
461|Customer service dreadful , have just recieved a final bill two months after I left them demanding GBP211.00 no information on the letter as to why this money is owed, I have worked out they owe me as I have used far less this winter than last, hour and a half waiting time on phone! Online account automatically shut down as it would not recognise my password, finally got through by phone and was told my final bill was estimated and that they did not receive my final readings which they did, please please avoid !!!!!!!!
462|I have totally had enough of Scottish Power. Firstly, they allowed us to go a year, underpaying our Direct Debit and did not bother to inform us that this was not enough to cover the electric we were using. At the end of the year, we moved house, where I called them and transferred all the details to the new address. That month I received a bill for GBP108, when I called to pay it, I was told that there is nothing owed and I do not need to worry about it, and we just set up another Direct Debit (which I thought I had done the first time I called them). Randomly in July, they attempted to take GBP750 from my account! I quickly rang them to find that they had no idea why this was taken and didn't even have a record of it. A week later I received a bill from my bank for going overdrawn and decided that no way was I paying for their error. When I called them the woman was not able to help me and so it was referred as a complaint, with my bank statement and bill from the bank as proof of this transaction. I received an email back stating that they will contact me within 5 working days. Well, 6 working days later, I had heard nothing, so called them again. I was then informed that the man I spoke to when I 'transferred' my details, didn't actually do that in full, so all my bills and letters had been sent to the old address, and that due to this, we had no idea that we apparently owed them GBP750. After a lengthy conversation we agreed that she will send us the bills and we can figure out the best way for us to pay this balance. The following morning, they attempted to take the GBP750 again. Leaving me another overdrawn bill and also causing other bills to go unpaid! I called them once again, very unhappy and the reply I received was that she couldn't find my old address and it was now referred as a higher complaint and I would receive a call in 5-7 days. I have now contacted my bank and cancelled the Direct Debit and I am sick of this blooming company. They have no idea what they are doing and I feel that their customer service is appalling. They have made this very difficult for me and caused a lot of stress. I am seriously looking into changing my Electric and Gas to someone else.
463|I waited 60 minutes or so to talk to customer service five times, each time they said they would investigate my complaint and call me back.......Im still waiting...!! Rubbish company, rubbish customer sevices. Im looking for a new energy supplyer even if I have to pay more...
464|Sent us a FINAL ENERGY bill which we paid in full. This was then followed by a FINAL ESTIMATED Electricity Bill for over GBP120. Called customer service numerous times and never got through. Emailed there customer complaints address and got back a standard reply stating they would sort out my complaint within 15 working days, guess what nothing received apart from another bill for GBP34. This has been followed by a several emails telling to go to there website and log on as there is an urgent message for me. Tried this but unable to log on as they have closed by internet account. Just received FINAL DEMAND for the GBP34 even though I have wasted hours of my time trying to get some sensible response from them. I hope they do take me to court to get the GBP34 because I am sure a judge and media will be very interested in there atrocious treatment of customers. In over 40 years of trading internationally this by far the worst company I have ever had the displeasure to getting involved with.. Do not have anything at all to do with Scottish Power.
465|After a long wait,I did speak to an advisor who gave me the wrong information and so the process of trying to speak to someone started again. After waiting for almost an hour,I spoke to Liverpool, Glasgow twice and then Wrexham when my phone's battery died and I almost give up the will to live !!They were mentioned on the main news this morning that Citizens Advice had them as one of the worst for complaints. Second bottom in the big six with complaints double in the first quarter.I did find the email address for Neil Clithero, the CEO of retail, sent him two messages three days ago and guess what ? You were right, no reply.Rotten from the top down !
466|Have experienced terrible serice from Scottis Power especially to contact them - a promise to ring me back in two to three hours - still waiting . . . Very inefficient company. 
467|Switched to this lot on the promise of cheaper bills as gauged by U-Switch. Unfortunately U-Switch does not compare competence...Got the agreement letter promptly then got the notification to enter my final meter readings. Now my meter is on Economy 7, and has Rate 2 as the day usage, and rate 1 as the night, so I phoned SE up to confirm they had these readings noted correctly before proceeding. They said they did, I gave them my readings, then I wait. And wait. And wait.Eventually I called up EDF to see what was going on and they confirmed my account had been closed and they processed my final bill there and then on the same readings I gave SE. We got our refunded credit from them within 5 days as well, so while their prices are poor, the service was at least very good in closing things down.Still nothing for SE though. No confirmation of the account being set up (just the agreement number), cannot set-up an online account, zip, zilch, nada.Then I got another letter from EDF...Our final bill is now under review as the readings they got handed down from SE conflict with those I gave them. I got on to the 'live chat' with EDF to ask what's up and the fellow figured out right away what had happened. SE have swapped the higher night rate around with the lower day one, so they were disputing it!!In spite of me taking the time to call them to make sure the got it right, and assurances they had the readings correctly taken, they somehow still got it wrong!! Perhaps that higher night rate (about double) was just too tempting or something...Anyway, EDF told me I have to call SE to set them straight. Couldn't get though so I booked a callback. Over an hour later I got the callback. The lady 'Vicky' I think (she was speaking quietly and a bit mumbled so hard to sure), takes my details and asks me to wait as she looks into it....Then she hung up!! Unbelievable!!I waited about 10 mins to see if they'd call gain. Nothing. Not at all happy I called again. this time I tried another option on the automated list they offer, 'thinking of switching over' iirc, hoping I might have better luck getting through. Sure enough I get through rather quickly. Evidently, potential new customers aint put on hold for very long methinks. Existing punters? They get hung up on...This time the lady was kind enough not to hang up on me, took all my details, looked at the readings and accepted they must have been swapped around. They have assured me they will get back to EDF in due course and EDF should send me a revised bill. I state the bill should in fact remain exactly the same as all the readings should now match and she then agrees...We shall see.... Cannot say I am overly confident this is done with just yet.All in all, not impressed so far at all. The savings will be welcome assuming they stick to it, but all the same I shall be looking elsewhere in the coming months as one thing I really cannot stand with any company is being made to jump through hoops to speak with someone, then have them hang up on me!! Well done 'Vicky', well done...
468|This company has sent me many letters, threatening to take me to court for non payment of an ESTIMATED Final bill ! I actually left them because I could never get through on the phone and my eMails were always unanswered. My new provider and I have contacted them ON 4 OCCASIONS with final readings and Scottish power IGNORE us - pushing forward with a 'system' that generates threatening letters stating I'd have my credit rating wrecked etc. In my 52 years I have NEVER EVER EVER dealt with a company that is I M P O z I B L E to communicate with - deal with them at your peril. G4S even read my meters 9 days after transfer ( I have the meter readers name, time of visit and readings on the day) and STILL they over exaggerated readings. I look forward to seeing them in Court.
469|What a joke, I have being trying to get through to someone in customers services for months!! the automated service is rubbish as it does not recognise your voice and gives you no options to talk to anyone. tried speaking to someone but your left holding for an hour or more! when you do get through to them they don't log anything so I end up getting the same letters through but threatening demanding payment when already said I don't live at the property! my poor letting agent has tried for hours on end to inform them of new tenants and just banging head against a wall, especially if the call log is high they simply have a voicemail saying to call back and you can not leave a message asking for a call back.it claims to have longer opening hours but im still holding after an hour morning day and night!! VERY POOR SERVICE - STAY CLEAR OF THEM.
470|I've been on hold for the more that half an hour just to speak with someone and I'm still waiting....
471|Just terrible.  Randomly sent me a bill for GBP500 and have tried numerous times to get hold of someone to discuss.  Email, call backs, sat on the phone for an hour on hold and still haven't managed to talk to anyone.
472|NEVER ANSWER PHONE AVERAGE WAIT AN HOUR TODAY ON MY EIGHTH CALL TO SORT OUT A BILLING PROBLEM WAS QUOTED 3 TO 5 HOURS.AS THE BILL IS IN CREDIT BY A LARGE AMOUNT THEY WILL NOT SEND ANY UP TO DATE BILLS OR REFUNDS AND THIS IS AFTER CALLING 8 TIMES.IF YOU RING SALES THEY  SEEM TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER CALLS QUICKLY. 
473|Before I start, I only gave them 1 star because I couldn't give them 0. Staff are shocking, I keep getting different information from different members of staff. They don't respond to emails, don't return calls. One woman said she'd call me back in 5 mins, still no call after half an hour so I called them back and she'd finished her shift 30 mins earlier. Clearly had no intention of calling me back. Staff tut and sigh. Sick of them! What do I like about them? Nothing! Don't go anywhere near these sharks!
474|After leaving Scottish Power in February it has taken me until now June to obtain my credit refund. I have been told lies, had promises made, been given various amounts re the credit and lastly told my refund would be made in next twenty days, which have passed with no refund. I wrote to the Ombudsman and finally to the Director Customer Services which eventually produced the cheque for the refund. Think very carefully before joining this supplier. Every review I have checked has vast amounts of bad reviews for this supplier.
475|This company is a disgrace. As short a story as possible - previously big consumers of both gas & electricity but moved overseas 2 years ago. The house is empty so clearly our consumption has absolutely plummeted to a miniscule amount. Don't bother trying to manage your acct online as any messages are totally ignored or (worse) inaccurately answered. Maybe their so-called Customer Service staff can't read? It took 4 months to get a partial (50%) refund of the GBP988 in credit and to reduce my DD to GBP80. I am still in credit but guess what an estimated bill has arrived apparently reassessing my account...on an estimated bill?? How can you reassess on an estimated bill? Why are you not taking any notice of our numerous calls and emails? Why aren't you comparing this years consumption with last years? There has been little or no fuel used in 3 months. Pathetic. I will now cancel the payment - in my experience this is the only way to get them to respond. Fortunately I swapped to a standard tariff after being hit with a charge last time - a charge that was levied because of their incompetence. It makes no difference if you are in credit by GBP988 or 988p they should not be holding onto your cash. Oh, and by the way if you leave and choose another provider and you are still in credit it takes them 13 weeks (over 3 months) to refund according to their website...wonderful.                
476|Want to wait 30 days for a response?   Want to wait 60 days for a bill based on actual meter readings?  Pick this lot.  Spanish (owned by Iberadola) service at it's absolute worst.   Surely it's illegal to refuse, or be unable, to issue an actual bill once meter readings have been sent 4 times in 2 months?  I hope never to have to deal with them again.  Sadly, my new supplier tells me I switched 3 weeks ago.  Scottish Power think that I'm still with them... and of course can't respond to emails.  I've given up.
477|Have you ever tried to contact Scottish Power in attempt to speak with an adviser?  If not, let me tell you what will happen.  Firstly, you will be assured by recorded message that calls are recorded for training purposes.  Secondly, you will salute the company after hearing that the working hours are extended to 10 p.m. during the week. At the final stage (the shortest!), after dialling option you need, the line will be cut off.  If you are lucky sometimes you may be foolishly consider a call back(like me), only to wait and not to speak (again!) with an adviser. I have tried numerous times to contact the team, not only by phone but on line too. To be truthfully honest I have managed once to reach an adviserBravo! One will say but in my experience this was fiasco  the system was dawn and I was advised to call again tomorrow.
478|"The question above was, ""Would you recommend to a friend?"" I wouldn't recommend to an enemy - there is no customer service as far as I can tell - and the web site is broken."
479|Having paid by DD for years they lost my details I tried from Nov 2013 to get in touch, they just didnt answer on various numbers or reply to my e mails, after 4 months I just gave up and changed to Ovo and they are brilliant, people answer the phone and talk, I give my meter reading every month and its cheaper.Scottish Power, never ever again.
480|ABSOLOUTLY ABYSMAL CUSTOMER SERVICE HAVING SAID THAT YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH AT ALL RINGS OUT FOR 40 MINUTES THEN YOU GET CUT OFF, BEEN TRYING FOR 2 DAYS, YOU REQUEST A CALL BACK WHICH NEVER HAPPENS, YOU EMAIL THEM THEY IGNORE EMAILS. I HAVE JUST GIVEN UP WAITED FOR 40 MINUTES TODAY THEN GOT CUT OFF, AVOID SCOTTISH POWER AT ALL COSTS, THE WORSE COMPANY EVER NO APPOLGIES FOR KEEPING YOU HOLDING ON THEY HAVE THE CHHEK TO RATE THEM BY STARS AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A STAR WELL THEY DON'T DESERVE ANY SO IGNORE THE STAR RUBBISH ABYSMAL COMPANY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO MY WORSED ENEMY
481|I have just, thankfully, left this supplier and have been fighting for nearly 2 months to stop them using their estimated final gas reading instead of the correct one sent to them.  I have been told I must accept their estimate, so am paying for gas I have not used.  As they received the meter reading from me 4 days before I left, yet added more units for 4 days than I had used all month, I can only deduct that they set out to deliberately defraud me, probably as punishment for leaving.  I am accepting this only because I want to finally finish with them, but would advise anyone thinking of switching to think again.  
482|Having taken two extra months payments from my bank account, I cannot speak to anyone, since the phone is not answered. The system is designed to prevent anyone from writing to them. Eventually, I got an address from the Annual report and accounts.Ombudsman and/or OFGEM seems to be the only way.
483|For a good number of years we received excellent service from Atlantic, then Scottish Power got involved. Absolute disaster since then. Customer service is non existent. Promised callbacks never happen. Website problems still not righted after two months. Not able to enter meter readings so am directed to phone. Seems they are all out doing the Highland Fling. Hang on for ages but if/when somebody does answer they are particularly unhelpful and despite promises to phone back nothing ever heard from them. Try to book a callback and they cannot allocate a slot for at least 24 hours.WHAT A DISGUSTING COMPANY. Time they were taken over by an organisation that knows how to run a company.Advice to potential customers: Avoid this lot like the Plague.
484|convinced to go to scottish power by a cold caller and wud pay GBP147.75 a month.when i had to move house they sent me a bill for GBP607.14.when i enquired of this amount i was told in no uncertain terms,this is what u owe and this is what we want.threatened with legal action by 2 different companies using verbal bullying tactics ie the bill will keep rising,costs etc.went to my bank and got a years back statements and discovered they'd only been taking GBP47.75 a month.went back to scottish power and told them what had happened and after getting them to call off their bullies was informed that they apologised for this instance,would knock the bill down to GBP500 and i offered to pay it off at GBP20 a month to which they agreed.i paid off a couple of payments then they changed the number.haven't paid for months now an automated voice tells me GBP20 is not enough.my advice,don't go with scottish power.as a pensioner i found the whole episode extremely distressing.
485|5.5 million Customers and approx. 25% of them have complained in the just last 2 months alone! Terrible service! Was previously a happy customer for 9 years. New online service is rubbish doesn't seem to correspond to what the advisors can see when you phone. Callbacks hardly work just end up in a queue and sometimes get cut off when you do get through. Overcharging - Duplicate bills on 13 Feb one GBP56.74 and another GBP63.74 (both actual readings from me apparently) was promised one or both would be deleted! Can't read bills never available to view. The consumption online data states I used GBP31! Of electricity in an 11 day period! But previously and correctly a 64 day period cost was GBP63.74 (no change in product/service). My usual cost is about GBP80/90 per month for both gas and electric! My billing issues started in February and are still not resolved complaint raised 13/03/14 complaint ID 800***200 (9 digits long) .Still not resolved so further complaint on 03/05/14 and you guessed it ID 800137***4 (now 10 digits long) The additional digit represents 1 million 276 thousand and 334 complaints raised since my first! Steer clear!
486|"Over 1000 customers have commented on Scottish Power's Facebook page about the poor quality of customer service they have received. They do not act on feedback and make empty promises about improving - in fact feedback is ""disappeared"" from their timeline profile on Facebook. In my own case, all I want to do is pay for my power supply. They are unable to provide me with a bill, I therefore cannot pay said bill. My bill is a ghost in their IT system, they have promised to send it on numerous occasions. They have sent no bill, but they can manage to send a debt collection agency. Consumers shouldn't have to put up with this. I am not the only one - there are over 1000 of us alone on your Facebook page. SIGN and PROMOTE if you have had a similar experience"
487|45mins to get an answer listening to their 1 CD over and over! Unable to properly process Meter readings and keep sending out incorrect or estimated readings. Phone line information different from webpage. Managers will not come on the phone! Has been nothing but a headache. I would recommend anyone to avoid like the plague.
488|Awful customer service.  Expect to wait at least 30 minutes to speak to somebody by phone.  In the  past 18 months, I have not seen a bill or received a bill. I have been unable to access the online account to view bills, and nobody has been able to help.  I have noticed the standing order has doubled and yet I am not able to check what I am being charged for.  I have followed their complaints procedure - no reply to my complaint!  I am now transferring to OVO which has a much better customer service rating.
489|"Tried to contact them regarding cancelling new agreement - I dialled the nos on the ""Welcome  to Scottish Power"" email.Telephone message said they had improved their service by opening till 6 on Saturdays. After 30mins,then and hour,waiting further hour ,someone to my surprise answered!!!!!!I got to know their music tape by heart by now!!!This was 6.10, I was not able to be put through to the correct dept as they were not open! Would arrange call back within 3 days(discounting Sunday).I will try make contact on Monday myself, as I only have a 14 day cool off period and the service give doesn't give me any confidence in the company.Wouldn't go back to them if they were the last provider going!!!When you read the reviews you can see this is a common problem."
490|Kept waiting for 20 minutes then call disconnected. Apalling.I am going to take my custom elsewhere!
491|Reading these reviews and the Facebook page set up to handle all of the disgruntled customers (and there's more than a few) it just makes me wonder how this bunch manage to retain any customers. I too have experienced the 45 minute wait to speak to a person, albeit not a very helpful one, had my emails and requests for call backs ignored, only to be told that the reason they hadn't billed me was because they hadn't had my meter readings. Fair enough I thought, what happened to the reminders that I used to get? The response was that they had suspended sending the reminders for some reason but they were now reinstating them. In the meantime, they've still been taking the money every month. I appreciate that not everything will run smoothly in an organisation, but the measure of a competent and professional outfit is how they deal with problems - Scottish Power just don't bother.
492|Our tariff was changed by SP without our being informed.  We were then sent several rudely worded bills one of which was pre-dated by nearly two months from being sent (April 2nd sent, date claimed to be February 13th).  I assume that this was to imply payment irregularity on our part in order to justify their action but was gross misrepresentation at the least (all of this evidenced!).Customer service awful as others have suggested--SP in my opinion based on experience do all they can to avoid customers presumably in order to avoid dealing with complaints.I really feel sorry for the poor souls who answer the 'phone (eventually)--not their fault that SP are so bad.
493|for 48 minutes, then their system put me through to the wrong department. A nice lady tried to get me through the system. OMD were playing All I want is Electricity, some bl88dy decent service would be nice as well!!!!!!! The nice lady put me through to the queue and the line dropped. Absolutely brassed off
494|I have tried to contact Scottish Power on the phone on numerous occasions, twice waited 45 minutes for someone to answer without success. I have written to the company on their web page and customer support page and they haven't had the decency to respond. I am going to stop my direct debit payment and see if they contact me then.I am disgusted with there lack of response to all my messages etc. and wish I hadn't changed from EDF.
495|When finishing my contract with SP, on Jan 28, I supplied accurate meter reading of 73813 to new supplier OVO  which they then passed on to SP. SP decided to use a totally fictitious reading of 78652. They then took GBP467.94 from my account without warning. After several phone calls, endless waiting for someone to talk to, many ignored emails they finally agreed that I was GBP488.91 in credit and I am still waiting to see that credited to my account. Recent phone calls, time consuming because of the long waiting time on the phone, suggest it will not happen any time soon.They were fine until I wanted to move to another supplier and they don't tell you this in the small print.I will never use them again as I do not want to be locked in
496|Have sent four emails in four months to the Scottish Power complaints department, written to a CEO and sent a letter to the Complaints Dept Director regarding their Home Comfort boiler service insurance. With the emails they have assured me that my complaint is under investigation and they take approximately five working days to reply. Result? No further answers to the emails, no reply to either letter. Reading the mass of one-star reviews on this website I am no longer surprised. Roll on the end of my contract with this useless company!!!!
497|Abysmal!! Beware. We had been complaining that our energy bills were excessive and had raised this matter with Scottish Power on numerous occasions without any consideration from the people we were speaking to. They insisted that there was nothing wrong with our billing and we were an average user. However on consulting with neighbours with similar properties we were paying far in excess of all our neighbouring properties and being extremely frugal with our use. Back in October my partner noticed that the time clock was working out of sync and shortly afterwards that the meter readings were being transposed by Scottish Power  this obviously explained why things were not being billed as expected. We had been using our energy monitor and checking our use and we were also aware that a meter reader had noticed a discrepancy but advised that he was not permitted to disclose this to us. Also I remember when we first moved to Scottish Power and being questioned over the meter readings I submitted though no one explained why they were questioning but just said that they needed to confirm. We are a low income family and just like many people in the current economic climate our budget is extremely tight. We cannot afford to waste money anywhere. Fortunately once the problem with the time clock was discovered Western Power were instructed to attend and this was replaced quite quickly. However the re-billing of our account seems to be taking some considerable time. I work in Property Management and deal with many utility companies on a frequent basis and I do understand that this case is perhaps rare but by no means unusual. In my experience re-billing of accounts has never taken as long as this  most probably because more often than not it is in favour of the utility company. I believe that we have been more than patient but really tired of hearing excuses now. We would appreciate a little less talk and more action if possible and this has been dragged out for almost a year since we first raised the issue of why our bills were excessive. We are totally flabbergasted at how poor the customer service is at Scottish Power. (Quote) Scottish Power customer services are one of the most abysmally ineffective services I have ever had the displeasure of being forced to use. At no point were they even close to anything that could be considered an acceptable standard of service, and every one of their customers are worse off for suffering their existence. Our latest response from Scottish Power: Dear Mr & Mrs Hill, Unfortunately I have no updates on the re-billing of your account as previously advised we are experiencing system problems and there is a system defect that is preventing us from correcting your account. This is currently being looked into but I am unable to confirm exactly when this will be resolved. I understand this is not satisfactory for you and this is why I had issued the deadlock release letter to allow you to take your complaint to the Energy Ombudsman. As you have now taken your complaint to the ombudsman they will be investigating your complaint further and will be in contact with us. I can see from your complaint that we have received contact from the Ombudsman and your complaint has now been assigned to an agent who works in our Ombudsman complaints team. Kind Regards. Beggars belief doesn't it!!
498|Been with sp for 3 years no problems in October they changed their on line software and my economy 7  which is 2 on my meter and day rate is 1 on my meter have been reversed. So now all my cheap readings are charged  at the higher rate. I have complained called 10 times spent 4 hours now on the phone and still nothing. They say they know why it's happened but won't change this. Still only 2 weeks to go and then onto the ombudsman. Wonder if that will work
499|SCOTTISH POWER? NAMED AND SHAMED I converted my electricity and gas on 13/10/2013 to meters with the intention of renting out my house. About 20 million hours on the telephone to them later, asking for a refund of the balance. I got precisely GBP3 paid into my bank account last week. It simply defies belief. Apparently i have to go to the ombudsman to get what i am due for all my over-payments? I already contacted our SNP MP Mike Weir as i was simply disgusted and ashamed that this company prefixes their title with the word SCOTTISH. He has made a complaint to them on my behalf, seriously? A GBP3 refund? My account which i cannot display or copy shows that i am over GBP700 in credit...lolololo
500|Switched from this company a couple of months ago. They were apparently slow passing details to new supplier. I have had two final bills saying I was in credit in excess of GBP100 but no refund. Tried contacting Customer Services and on four seperate occasions have been put on hold for more than 20 minutes without getting through to anyone. Would not recommend this company, even in the bad bunch we currently have in the uk!!!
501|I have been with SP for about 5 years. This year they became more expensive than anyone else in Scotland. I have switched to OVO. As a punishment SP is withholding more than 300 (!!!) pounds overpayment. Well, SP I will take you to court if I have to, this is beyond any joke.I am waiting for the phone to be answered for about 55 minutes now and no sign of a single assistant. Nice one!Do yourself a favour and stay clear and wide away from this dreadful company!Update. They have answered the phone after 57 minutes and a very helpful lady assisted me. That was however the quality of the person, not the company`s...
502|Agree with other reviewers, have been with SCOTTISH POWER several years but now cannot get online to give readings or access my account, on hold 3 times for approx 1 hour, tried their complaints phone number and constantly engaged - no doubt by other angry customers, I would recommend that you DO NOT use this company, cannot wait to switch.unfortunately cannot give MINUS 5 stars for their telephone support.
503|I emailed them over 2 weeks ago to ask them to refund the GBP900 they had accumulated via direct debt and to change tariff, despite their 5 day reply policy, still no reply! Called them today on the existing customer line no-one answered for an hour and then i was cut off.  Yet on their new customer line they answered straight away surprisingly!  yet of course they can't help.  I was then given a number to call that would be answered straight away - this went through to security who put me through to a line that was too busy so I needed to call back!  Called the new customer line again to be put through again to a line that was too busy so I needed to call back! So well done Scottish Power you've lost yourselves a customer!
504|I haven't had any contact from Scottish Power since a letter confirming my tariff in July 2013.  Trying to access my account I was being told WRONG PASSWORD which I know is incorrect.  So rang and took option of call back.  I was subsequently call back and the assistant emailed a new temporary password.  This took about an hour to come through.  On trying temporary password it wasn't accepted, on screen message if tried three times it would be blocked. GREAT !!!!!So tried ringing 1st call holding for 20mins                 2nd call holding for 15mins                 3rd call holding for 15minsI'm now on my 4th call 25mins.ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - WILL BE LOOKING FOR NEW SUPPLIERG Attwood
505|It is impossible to get through on the telephone lines.  After 45 minutes on hold on numerous occasions I simply gave up and moved to another provider.Trying to get a refund of my credit is equally frustrating.  After nearly three MONTHS I am still waiting for a refund.
506|This company uses an automated system of payment. Invariably it does not work for one reason or another. If after several hours of trying I manage to speak to an operative you can guarantee the system will be down. Their online system is as bad too. They make it virtually impossible to complain to anyone. I feel like they do not want my money every time I try to pay a bill. bizarre. I am now in the process of changing to eon as I have been told although they have an automated system too it works. Fingers crossed.   
507|RENTING MY PROPERTY  POWER CHANGED METERS TO PRE PAY IN FEB LAST YEAR TO TENANTS  EVICTED THEM AFTER PROBLEMS POWER NOW WANT TO CHARGE ME TO CHANGE THEM BACKJ AS HOUSE IS SOLD OR CHARGE THE NEW COUPLE THE BILL FOR NOT HAVING PRE PAY,.  ARE THEY MAD? I NEVER AUTHORISED THIS CHANGE NOW TODAY IS MY 9TH CALL ALL AT MY EXPENSE AND THE REPLY IS THE SAME THE YOUNG COUPLE EITHER PAY GBP150 SECURITY DEPOSIT OR GBP150 TO GET THEM OUT I HOOPE COUPLE SWITCH TO ANOTHER PROVIDER I ASKED TO GO AHEAD AND ALL IM GETTING NOW IS EXCUSES WAITING ON CALL BACK NOW LIKE PROMISED  RUBBISH SERVICE RUBBISH CALL CENTRE RUBBISH PROVIDER DO NOT GO NEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
508|absolutely appalling customer service, if they don't like your complaint after you have waited an hour for the phone to be answered they just hang up on you! and watch your account funny how extra charges seem to appear without you noticing? best thing that could happen to this company is for them to close and do everyone a favour! cannot find anything good about them.
509|Having been on a fixed rate plan and been overcharged constantly (which SP won't adjust but will refund you when you hit GBP500 of credit on your account) I applied to move my account to E-ON. SP seem to have dragged their feet over the transfer and surprise, surprise my unit rate has doubled, dropping my GBP430 of credit down to GBP200. Incidentally the new supplier's unit rate is still 2/3 of the new unit price of SP, so it's not as though it's market rate they're charging, it's designed to fleece those coming out of fixed rate deals. I'll certainly never use them again.
510|After moving into my new property in August i still havent managed to pay scottish power anything. I have only managed to get to speak to them twice, first time she set up a direct debit to go out the 15th of every month and would set my online account up, the 15th came and nothing got took out, rang my bank and asked them and got told they hadnt received anything off them to set one up, tried to log-in online and couldnt get on, clicked at least 7 times for them to re-send me a password and im still waiting for an e-mail with it on!! Tried to contact them again i was on the phone for 2 hours before someone even answered me, then i got put on hold for another 20 mins then got the phone put down on me!! This company is absolutely diaboligcal and the customer service is non-existant. Actually thinking of lending money off my parents to pay them what i owe and switch to another suppplier!! Avoid these like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
511|forget this supplier if you want any sort of service. reported to them my economy 7 meter was faulty. several hours slow a problem I could have abused but no being a honest person I phoned them got an appointment waited all day for them no one arrived to change meter. next day phoned again same as before no one arrived. now waiting for them to contact me lol.  just forget this company!!!!!! also tried to increase my direct debits to them on phone told this was all set up but two payments later I am still paying the old amount. phone them that's a joke don't try it unless you can wait for 28 mins and up to 1hour 12 mins I HAVE GIVEN UP...
512|Took out boiler insurance with them in feb 13. Paid GBP17 a month, and booked a boiler service for the 7th October 13. They didn't show up after taking a day off work. I called to cancel as they have not been in contact, to be told I can have a refund of 8 months at GBP17. I have called 9 times to get my money back. Still waiting today 31st December 2013. I have today contacted Watchdog. I had the courtesy to call them and let them know of my intentions. They weren't bothered! Avoid avoid avoid. You can do better.
513|Like everyone else, Scottish Power's customer service is shockingly bad.  I have been on hold for 47 minutes and I still have the phone to my ear while I write this.  My call was answered after 22 minutes but the chap said he couldn't get my details on his screen so he was transferring me as a priority to another section, I wouldn't be kept waiting a long time. That was 25 minutes ago!  I'm going to look into what it will cost me to switch to another supplier.  I was with SSE (Atlantic)before and they had superb customer service, worth paying a little more me thinks to have the good service. As soon as I can I am off from this company
514|"to hike up their prices through the roof come renewal time, run a web-site that makes it literally impossible to find out what the best deal is and if you are getting it, not respond to emails, and then.... when you switch to another supplier, pester you with emails and 'phone calls (including evenings and weekends even if you are on the TPS) offering you a ""better deal"" (better than what exactly - their website prices? The old deal? The other supplier? Never got and answer to those sorts of questions either). Obviously, they are all gits, but surely the special biscuit must go to them? When, for the love of man, will the government and regulator get a grip of this awful industry and make them perform to a minimum standard of transparency and decency in exchange for their eye watering profits?"
515|I have been a new customer for full energy (fixed rate) for six months.During this period I have contacted customer services 7 times by email, though promised response within 5 days, none addressing my concerns, even if they did reply (well over 5 days). Having attempted with hours of telephone time for contact, I have only got through twice, after a wait of at least 20 minutes (have waited longer with no human contact).On the first occasion they promised to phone me back, no call received, on the second time they did not even attempt to address my concerns, told me to refer to site, where the problem error related.The almost NON Existent customer service is appalling; along with Scottish Power's awful online account system, which always has errors. More annoying is that on every concern, you have to again give meter readings, even though I have provided 5 in two weeks.As soon as my fixed rate cost energy expires (Sept 2014), I am off from this awful company. They have no regard for any personal concern, a could not care less attitude.BIG MISTAKE joining this company. Previous experience with Southern Electric, their customer support is brilliant, any problems sorted almost immediate. I shall RETURN to SE.Even at extra cost.My advice is steer clear of Scottish Power, they are the worst people to deal with, and human contact will take you hours at least.SCOTTISH POWER are a DISGRACE!
516|Like all the other reviews before I have had severe problems getting through to a human being at this Company. No wonder Utility Companies are hated so much in this Country. The worst bit is waiting for 30 minutes and then getting cut off which seems to happen to everyone else all the time as well. All I want is a refund of my money as I am nearly 4 months in credit due to letting them set the monthly payments. I have an ingenious idea to stop this happening in future and that is to impose fines to all Power Companies when they don't answer phones. Say for instance, they were fined GBP1 for every minute you have to hang on the line waiting to be answered by a Human. They would sharp answer the phone then wouldn't they??  This would kill two birds and  help  the Government reach their efficiency money targets as well!!
517|Too many examples of poor service to list here but to name but a few...3 years to spell my name correctly. Over an hour to answer a call, in fact worse, answer immediately and put you immediately on hold so it costs you money. Handled my home move in the worse possible way I have ever experienced. 
518|Moved to cheaper Scottish power only to find how shocking customer service is! only stayed 10 months and moved back to my previous supplier. its now 4 months on and i have a final demand to pay them GBP175, but still dont have a detailed bill despite two letters asking for it and they have final readings. if i could give them a zero star i would!
519|Gradually over a two year period my direct debits were increased by double. Four weeks ago I requested a refund of GBP100 having a credit of over GBP200. I did this online. I had  returned messages back which made no sense followed by an email which stated a refund would be actioned. After various chasing communications online nothing received. Calls had a wait time of 1 1/2 hours. My most recent bill showed a charge of GBP100 which therefore made my credit reduce as it showed as a debit. Around this time we decided to switch to another supplier as we could get a monthly reduction of half. I eventually got through on the phone to find out what the debit was for. I was told it was their error they had entered wrongly and should of been my refund. I was told someone would ring me back to tell me when I would receive my refund that day. No one called me........ Following day I phoned again to be told as I was switching they could not deal with yet and it would be sorted at the point of switch I just know I will be ringing again to get my money back and fighting their error. Don't touch scottish power, customer service is appalling and they keep your money. If I treated customers this way in my job we would be closed down how do they get away with it?? Ombudsman and sunday times next course of action I think
520|Switched to Scottish Power in November 2012 on their fixed price online tariff until March 2014. I did have my reservations after reading reviews online but then to be honest all the energy firms had equally bad press and reviews. I have to say from a customer point of view that I have had no problems with them at all since switching over. I manage everything online and every 3 months give my meter reading either online or if that's not possible, due to them updating the website, then I call them. I have only had to call once and got straight through to customer services with no problem. The agent I dealt with was very polite and friendly and cannot fault the service I received at that time. My bills have been spot on and very reasonably priced considering I live in a rural area and only have electric in my property. So to sum up Scottish Power I would say that if you manage your account properly and give accurate meter readings when you should then I don't see you having a problem, I hope that they are able to offer me another good deal come March if not then I will shop around like any other person for the best price. I'm not giving 5 stars as for that I believe a company needs to be exceptional which these days is few an far between!
521|Absolutely shocking customer service I have repeatedly tried to get hold of Scottish Power since 22 October, requested call backs, sent emails, held for over 30 mins (nearer the hour) on numerous occasions just to be cut off when I finally get through!  Absolutely shocking, shall be contacting the Ombudsmen again once I hit the 8 week mark and would urge anyone else with complaints over 8 weeks to do the same.  
522|I joined Scottish Power about 5 years ago when there service was quite good. But lately I have found it impossible to contact them, I have spent 3 weeks trying to get through by phone, you get an automated message saying there is up to a 30 minute wait, at which point you get cut off! If you are given the chance to wait you will get cut off 10 - 15 minutes into the wait, or you receive another automated message saying please try later or contact us by email, then you are cut off again.So I sent them an email and got an automated response to say they would contact me within 5 days which they didn't! I have now sent 2 emails to there complaints department and received 2 automated responses saying that they will contact me with 5 days which of course they haven't!!! Oh and to top it all there call back service where you could enter your phone number and someone would call you back also no longer works.This company has gone from quite good to totally useless!!! I would give them zero out if ten for customer service, they give the impression they have turned the lights off and all gone home!When my current fix price deal comes to an end I am off!!! They can stick it where they sun doesn't shin! I will not stay with Scottish power no matter what deal they offer!
523|A company that scores 5 at taking your money. if you ever have a problem that requires you to make contact then heaven help you. expect to wait 30 mintes before your call is answered and then they try to fob you off to another department. Absolutely disgraceful. also show 0845 number on bill as opposed to free phone number which is also available.DO NOT JOIN!! 
524|Notified Scottish Power of moving house on the 26th November 2013, providing a final meter reading.was informed the account would be closed and a final bill based on the reading sent to my new address.As of the 2nd December 2013 I had heard nothing and called back. The staff claimed there was no record of the earlier call and relogged it.As of the 9th December 2013 I called again to chase and was told there was no record of the earlier 2 calls and the staff member was rude, pretending they couldnt hear me the minute I said I wanted to be transfered to complaints.I called back AGAIN and spoke to someone else, who was friendly but seemed cluless as to how to rectify and simply recorded a disatisfied service account. How difficult is it to generate a final bill and either take a card payment over the phone or send out a final invoice letter?DO NOT USE SCOTTISH POWER IF YOU PLACE ANY VALUE ON YOUR TIME.I've had to say 'good' in value for money is this is one area they did get right.
525|Just joined them recently. My account still isn't set properly despite them telling me that I can now view it online. Long waiting on telephone, I gave up in end. When you tell them online to ring back at a selected time they dont do that either. I am thinking after less than 4 days to leave them they can sod off for my paying a fee to leave
526|I must be dealing with a different power company as my experience over a number of years is totally in conflict with the general thrust of other contributors. For example I had two conversations with customer service this morning. Longest wait time on the phone before a human answered was 8 mins 15 sec (I have a timer on my phone). All my questions were answered without any trauma. Online system works well for me. Any changes to my DD up or down are done in consultation with customer service. I have Solar energy so my DD can vary subject to my power input from the panels especially in the summer months. I have therefore made a number of changes to DD without any issues. Currently coming to the end of my 3 fixed price deal and therefore looking around, although SP has an advantage on customer service for me that makes me hesitant to change to another supplier. Reading some of the other power companies reviews makes me concerned about switching? 
527|Scottish Power will increase your direct debit at random using your highest energy consumption to calculate the monthly debit. That debit does not reduce to reflect periods of lower consumption such as in the summer, the higher charge continues throughout the year which effectively means you are being overcharged and they are using your money to fund their business. This is sharp practice and should be addressed by Ofgem accordingly.k.lvml
528|I closed my Scottish Power account over 2 months ago due to moving out of rented accommodation. I gave accurate meter readings on the day of moving out and issued them to SP who acknowledged receipt. I then received a final bill online, based on estimated amounts. I contacted SP via email to ask for a full refund of my credit balance and to check that they had received my final meter readings. After no response I emailed and called again to be told that this had been sent out to me in the post. It didn't arrive so I called again. And again. Each time I was told something different. They said a) it had been sent as a cheque b) it had been sent via BACs to my account c) it would be sent via cheque/BACs within 10 working days. I received an amount of GBP5.66 compensation into my account but no full refund. I have had to call again twice this week to be told they will look into it and call me back within 10 working days. I just want my money back. It is almost impossible to get through on the phones, I have been hung up on twice, and each member of customer service told me a different thing each time. I will NEVER open an account with Scottish Power again. Avoid like the plague!
529|The only reason I give them 2 stars is the price was good but they are impossible to contact. Emails are not answered as stated within the five working day period and I guess if you waited five days on the phone they still would not pick up. I have waited for over twenty minutes a number of times and when they did pick up I was cut off immediately. Wouldn't recommend them if they were half the price.
530|I went on a 'fixed' plan with Scottish Power that has now (thankfully) expired in Oct '13. Afte the cooling off period we have had nothing but aggrovation, frustration and bad mannerisms! I had to contact the at least once a month, and wait a MINIMUM of 15 minutes to be answered! And as their number is 08, now my phone bill will go down too! I waited on the phone to them before for 3 hours! And even then they hung up on me! I was clearly not amused!! They kept on taking various ammounts out of my bank account (despite the so called fixed plan!) when i reminded them that this action was indeed illegal without my consent they couldnt care and fobbed me off with all sorts of excuses! Their staff were (throughout the year) rude, arrogant and a general lack of empathy (especially after the waiting in a queue for ages!) for the customers! They clearly need to train up their staff in how to be polite! I have got nothing positive to say about Scottish Power what so ever apart from how on earth they have a business?! Their company is a disgrace and appauling and I can only advise that you steer clear of them! Clearly from what I have read from other reviews online, I'm not alone, not only in my opinion but also the service to which we have been in reciept of! I have had to raise a formal complaint now as i'm fed up of this behaviour from a company! I checked my account with them this morning and they said i owed them GBP80..... erm I dont think so Scottish Power becuase I actually check my account online and i'm in credit, so probably wont get a response regarding the complaint or the money! Goodbye Scottish Power!!
531|cannot give any stars to Scottish power.  Tried to contact them  umpteen times  - no joy.  The previous reviewer is absolutely 100% correct.  If you value your sanity please do not go anywhere near this company.  Keep well away!!
532|THREE WEEKS TRYING TO GET SOME ONE TO ANSWER THE PHONE.ALL THEIR PHONES ARE ANSWERED BY MACHINES. YOU CANT GET PAST THE MACHINE. IF THE MACHINES WERE IN CHARGE MAYBE YOU COULD GET SOME SERVICE.TIME TO TRANSFER TOANOTHER  COMPANY. HEY HO AWAY WE GO.WHAT DO I LIKE ABOUT THEM NOTHING AND LESS THAN THAT.
533|"Having Contacted the Scottish Power customer services department to alert them that i was no longer to be the main account holder and change the bank details so as the DD could be taken from the correct bank account n MAY2013 it is now November and i am still being debited for the account! Despite every month when the DD is deducted we phone ""Customer Service"" and routinely are told that it has been changed, evidently not!  after Octobers call to ""Customer Services"" they acknowledged their mistake and even reimbursed us for the amount they had take (over GBP200 in credit on the account). Much to my dismay again November rolls around and out comes the DD for an amount that they have also Doubled since August. They said this was as we were out of the summer they assume we would use more fuel. This is wrong as they calculated our usage over three months Dec 12-Feb 13 due to another error on their part, (apparently in one month a single bedroom flat had used over GBP1000 of gas and electric, Not even possible)   Having spent the past three days trying to get through to Scottish Power (2 call backs never happened might i add) i eventually got through and was told that the customer care line that they were trying to connect me with was too busy. and they would phone back within 24 hours,as im now within that final 23hr and 30 minutes im guessing this isnt going to happen. So having taken a day off work to sort this im going to be left out of pocket from them and from my work.Needless to say i am absolutely seething with this company. But at the end of the day nothing will be done in any sort of good time to rectify the situation and even complaining to the ombudsman will take an eternity to resolve the issue. think ill just close my bank account.hope this helps"
534|Took out boiler cover and was told my boiler passed the inspection. Had a fault, and called out Scottish power. after numerous call outs, we were told nothing but lies. The story changed each time the engineer visited who spent on average 5 minutes looking at the problem each time. After 6 weeks without hot water I called and made an official complaint and was told that our boiler failed its inspection and we were not covered. They were taking my monthly payments quite happily! I cancelled immediately and was told I would have to wait 6 weeks for my money back. Guess what, I just checked my account and they have taken another payment! No customer service, rude staff. Am about to cancel my gas and electric with them too.
535|What a joke this company is.  Customer Service is totally non-existent there.  They don't answer their phones at all. They don't answer emails.  Everything is handled by the electronic robots.  Unfortunately the robots can't read, so no message is actually answered. Because of this system they issue all kinds of threats if you don't agree with their way of doing busines   We,the paying customers are not getting any sort of service at all.  The whole thing stinks, to put it mildly.  I wonder what percentage of MY contribution to their coffers is allocated to customer service.  I would guess nothing at all. Even though no-one ever actually answers the phone, they still have the audacity to keep you on hold for hours on end if you have the stamina. The robot occasionally intervenes and gives out numbere to call, but they fail to tell you that they will NOT answer anyway. MAYBE THEY ARE MAKING MONEY FROM THEIR TELEPHONE PROVIDERThe robots appear to have been in control of essential services for several weeks now.  How can this be right.  Steer clear of Scottish Power and their lack of ethics, or, like me and hundreds of others you will regret it, and probably never be able to escape them, simply because the robots can't read or answer questions.  The whole thing is an absolute shambles and I will be doing my best to escape their clutches asap. SCOTTISH POWER YOU ARE SHAMEFUL
536|over 5 hours spent on the phone trying to get them to change my direct debit after they just changed it lower for no reason. 4 emails nothing back. promised a call back 6 times - they have never called back -avoid at all costs this company
537|My boiler has broke down 4 weeks now. I've contacted Scottish Power several timesThey have been sending the same engineer outwho doesn't have a clue. Absolutely appalling service. 
538|Avoid at all cost. No customer service, no replies to my emails . Been on the phone for 40 mins waiting to speak to a human.
539|I needed to speak to them because my economy 7 times were all wrong and after holding for 30 minutes I rang back twice each time holding for another 20 minutes.  I eventually switched to another supplier on line while I was holding.  They never did answer so I have sent them an email expressing my disgust.
540|I was switched over to Scottish Power a week ago (Nov 6th) and logged into MyAccount for the first time to find my first direct debit due 30/01/14 - nearly 3 months away !!I tried to email SP with several switchover questions i had using their email service - after having written a lengthy email and pressing their submit button i got an error message -  therefore unable to email i tried their call centre 0800 number - the 1st time i got as far a queueing with one message 'you are moving towards the front of the queue' - held on for 5 minutes with accompanying complete silence. I hung up and called the 0800 number again, got through then 1 min silence, then one voice message 'thank you for you patience .....  ' then 30 secs of music then complete silence again for 3 minutes. I tried a third time when i did get regular messages (but no in-between music) 'thank you for your patience, an agent will be with you soon' - after 10 minutes of this i gave up.
541|Trying to contact SP by telephone to discuss my contract.  Calls either take interminably long to get to anybody or the automated message just says that they are very busy at the moment and to call back later, and the call is just disconnected.  I cannot believe that is how they treat their customers.  When this contract expires I will definitely be moving supplier regardless of whether or not it is more expensive.You have been warned, don't ignore it.
542|"Same experience as most of the other people reviewing the company. I am GBP130 in credit and moving out. All i want is my money back. Have spoken to four different people which has taken at least 2 1/2 hours and still nothing. Three callbacks promised, none received. They all say there is a problem accessing the refund page and i would need a call back. On the last call i said i did not want a call back and was happy to wait on the phone. Waited ten minutes and the adviser came back and said "" it appears you have not been billed for gas for 2 months and this will need checking"" he told me i would get a call back within the hour. Two days later and i am still waiting. Disgraceful customer service!!!!! "
543|I waited over 30 mins on the phone to stl get no answer. I sent  various emails and still had no reply. This has gone on over a month now. The phone call cost me over 6 pound. I am at the  point where i am going cancel my direct debit. Discusting
544|Have been trying to get Scottish Power to rectify a mistake they made when I moved home and change me onto the correct tariff for the past 6 months.  Every time I call I am placed on hold for 30 minutes or told they can't access my account right at the moment and that they will call me back (which they never do).  I am going to switch companies because of their customer service.
545|This company is the worst company I have ever encountered. You only need to take a look at their Facebook page to see the hundreds of disgruntled customers who can never contact them. They sent me a refund after I had overpaid an account at a previous address. Then they sent me a bill for 5p!!!After attempting to telephone them,I have given up. Been on hold on 5 occasions (without having spoken to a single person) for a minimum of one hour. I have sent countless emails (all unanswered). Use this energy supplier at your peril, as I can guarantee that in no way will you EVER be able to contact them. I think it is shameful that companies are allowed to operate like this.
546|Since reporting a fault on Friday 25 October at 09:30am to date I have been apologised to by a number of people.  It is now Monday 28 October at 09:00pm and still no repair carried out.
547|Up until 6 months ago, I was a Scottish Hydro customer for 2 years. At 1 point, some guy from Scottish Power appeared at my door offering a better deal. Stupidly, I went for it. I was told that I wouldn't have to do anything as they would do it all. They didn't and money came out my account by Scottish Hydro and I got a bank charge. I cancelled all direct debits until it got sorted out. Scottish Hydro covered my bank charge and Scottish Power sent debt collectors after me. I was done with them after that.Yesterday, I moved into my new house, and the worst luck, it's Scottish Power who are the current suppliers of gas and electricity. Both gas and electric meters are prepay. I got the gas going, but the radiators are not heating up and I put GBP10 in the electric, which accepted the GBP10, but didn't give me any electricity. I am currently on GBP1.13 emergency credit and I'm bloody freezing. Scottish Power are doing nothing to help, but are happy to accept the cash.This company are a total shambles and the incompetence by them is mind numbing. You would have to be a bit mad to even contemplate going near them.Shop around, ANY other company is definitely a step in the right direction!
548|Scottish Power know you are leaving and will send a ''sorry to loose you'' email, before your contract is up they will offer a new tariff [which they know you don't want] and will put you on their standard tariff but because you didn't tell them you don't want a new tariff they will put you on another 12 month contract they can then apply a cancellation fee. If you are lucky enough to get it back it will only be on the electric the GBP20.42 for the gas they will never return unless you want to go to the trouble of fighting it through the ombudsman. They should be investigated and prosecuted like any other criminal.
549|"The online ""support"" section of Scottish Power's website had gone down. Consequently I was forced to spend nearly three-quarter's of an hour on hold merely for the privilege of providing them with a set of final meter readings. Customer service? What a joke.  "
550|To begin with, they need to employ more people in the Scottish Power call centres so customers aren't put on hold forever before you can talk to someone!!Even though the prepayment system means you pay for what you use (essentially a payasyougo system) I ended up having a bill for around GBP70 when I moved out of my last property. I rang them up, they asked for our final meter readings. I said I gave the woman I spoke to the meter readings when we moved out but apparently she hadn't inputted them on the system. I had to ring up again when I had found the meter readings and was told they would be sending another bill through the post. As we were on the prepayment system, the woman I spoke to agreed with me that we technically shouldn't owe them anything.I received another bill yesterday saying we owe them GBP8.54. Now that is considerably less, but it says we were in credit with them (don't know how) and they charged us GBP51.51 for something. So I phoned them up yet again to find out what these charges are. After being put on hold again, the woman told me that when they have the actual meter readings they can work out how much electricity you have actually used?!I don't know if anyone else has had problems on the prepayment system but I just wouldn't recommend it at all. The customer advisers don't know what they're talking about and they either do not input meter readings you give them or input them in completely the wrong order (which has also happened to me before and they sent me a bill for over GBP100)Just steer clear!!!
551|I had been persuaded to try Scottish power by a nice sales assistant. That's where the good customer service ends!Having spent at least an hour on hold on several occasions I decided I'd had enough and sent an email stating I was going to remain with my current energy supplier. Then (oddly) Scottish power sent me a nice rejection letter some time later telling me I couldn't be a customer (no explanation given and that's fine I don't really care anyway)Anyway to cut to the chase just checked my bank account and they've decided to take around GBP130 out (For what? I'm not even their customer!!)Can't wait to spend half my day tomorrow on hold trying to get through to customer services.Please don't even consider changing to Scottish Power. 
552|I have contacted Scottish Power TWICE telling them that I know full well that they supply me with electricity to the house I moved into 2 weeks ago. On both occassions they have claimed the a different energy company (different each time) supplies us instead. We have now been told by the previous tenants and two seperate energy companies that we are indeed supplied by Scottish power, yet they still try to deny it. I am receiving electricity from someone, I just want to know who so I can sort out billing etc and not suddenly get cut off. This is a total joke and these guys should know what theyre doing since its a pretty simple procedure to check the national database and meter point numbers to confirm that they infact supply my electricty. I am extremely disappointed with this level of service and will be switching as soon as I can away from Scottish Power as I dont trust them to get it right to be honest. I also had to wait 20 minutes to speak to an operator on the phone. Overall the worst experiences I have had with a large companies in years. 
553|I have just spent the last 24 hours trying to get some information from Scottish Power - providers of both my energy services. All I wanted was information on how to move my meters approx 2 metres to a new location. Firstly a young man gave me the number of N-Power's services - when I contacted them they were as equally puzzled as to the reason why Scottish Power had given me this number as I was! After waiting over 90 minutes to have areturned call (the second in two days) I have now been given a number no longer used by National Grid to move the gas meter and another number to move the electricity meter which turns out to be AVIVA's motor insurance line!! I am absolutely frustrated!!!
554|"Like many people have discovered in this forum that trying to get hold of a ""human being"" that's works for Scottish power is like trying to get an audience with the Pope!My wife and I moved into our new house March last year and are we are still awaiting the boiler's first annual check. After many unsuccessful phone calls of listening to an automated message saying ""your call is important to us"" I eventually got through only to discover that my property wasn't actually on their filing system and the file may have been deleted or not transferred to their ""new system"" which was extremely convenient. The operator said they would have to look into the file and get my boiler registered with the boiler department and would give me a call back... Still waiting for that call and that was over a month ago and I don't think I have the strength to wait in a queue and then explain the situation to yet another person only to be fobbed off again.Once I have the boiler serviced I'm seriously thinking about leaving Scottish power... Please wish me luck! "
555|"Have been ONLINE FIXED PRICE ENERGY with Scottish Power for 1 year this month. I cannot wait to change due to extremely poor communication and customer service and no integrity or ethics when it comes to direct debit charges and refunds.THE FACTS:Claiming my usage was higher than expected they have more than doubled my monthly direct debit (without prior authorisation) from GBP59 to GBP141 which resulted in an overcharge for consumption and them owing me GBP374.05 net as of today (10-Oct-2013). My experience so far:(1) They claim to review the direct debit charge every quarter but factually do not.The direct debit increase happened over 6 months ago and has not been reviewed since.(2) They did not refund my credit balance as discussed and agreed over the phone. The consultant was very resistant to my request for a refund and tried to talk me out of reducing my direct debit. I now know he lied to me about refunding me within 10 days. I am still waiting.(3) They offer an online option to reduce your direct debit payments but charge of c.GBP15+ for doing so. Is this even legal?(4) Their customer service phone service takes you through the usual labyrinth before suddenly cutting off without warning.(5) They did not reply to any of my follow-up emails (except the usual automated responses)When i shared my experience with a work colleague, she revealed her elderly father's credit balance with Scottish Power had risen in excess of GBP1,000 and her sister was facing a similar experience chasing the refund.My view of Scottish Power is they use customers Direct Debit agreements as licence to help themselves to free cash advances through over-charging, justifying the practice with their ""variable direct debit"" clause.AVOID."
556|After being with SP for 8 years I followed government advice and switched suppliers to save money.  Final bill from SP included GBP5O cancellation fee which I was not aware of and wrote to them enclosing cheque for the gas and electric used but stating in my accompanying letter that I disputed this penalty payment.  No reply to my letter just a final demand with no reference to my letter. I will take this up with the Energy Ombudsman. Would never deal with SP again
557|My Direct Debit kept going up although my balance was in credit.  Rude customer service advisor told me I had to pay the required Direct Debit amount they had set as it was based on my consumption.  After taking another meter reading I am now more in credit so doubt my consumption is to blame for my high Direct Debit Payment.  Now going elsewhere - not happy!
558|I have a online account, and haven't been able to access it for the last 2 months, 4 phone calls later and still no joy, even though I was told in each phone call that it would be, the last phone call was supposedly logged as a complaint and was told they'd ring me back within 5 days and guess what...........you got it no contact whatsoever......now fed up with the poor service for the privilege taking 80 quid each from my bank account.....now changed suppliers.
559|I have boiler cover with my dual-fuel account what a joke call centers have no communication skills waited in 12hours for engineer not to turn up and 10 hours the next faulty gas valve will be 2days sent wrong valve three days later new valve fitted still no joy decided its the p.c. board 3hrs later we have hot water.Scottish power are a complete joke i rang to complain at least 30 times had 1return call of a supposed manager after i sent a rather caustic email stating how utterly useless they are he was going to sort everything out another joke, useless,sent in another 6 emails,just received a letter in the post offering GBP45 goodwill for all there blunders please ring this phone no xxxxxxxxxx to claim your goodwill sorry we do not deal with this, talk to all the other departs before you get back on the magic roundabout i then spoke to a very nice person who did try and sort it out but rang me to say he had also been on the magic roundabout and failed to get a result i was told in confidence there whole system and departments was in total diss ray to sum Scottish power up you cannot make a verbal complaint you cannot talk to a manager you are talking to the wrong department and on and on and on
560|"I have to agree with the comments of the other reviewer titled ""Dire with a Capital F"". This Company fails in so many respects - I joined them in June 2013 and as recently as yesterday (1st October 13) they still had difficulty establishing if I was a customer - I gave an account number, which they said didn't tie in with any of their systems - lets try a post code then ? - no sorry - no record - but you have taken 3 payments from me now via DD and I have this account number from YOU on my ""on-line account"" - no sorry still no record - can you  pass me over to someone more senior please, cant do that I'm afraid - we will call you back tomorrow to sort it out - ha ha I say - you have told me that before and you promised me a letter in July, which of course did not appear - I will bet you that no one calls me back tomorrow - oh I promise you sir ""we will call you back"".I was right of course - no phone call - no email - nothing. The service is absolutely atrocious - as is the WEB site - the call back service is a joke - there are no slots available - the complaint section is also a joke - no one reads them as no contact is ever made - BIG BIG MISTAKE going with SP - they are a shambles.When I called SP the last time (1/10/13) is took 55 minutes to get an operative to pick up - YES 55 MINUTES! what sort of service is that - THIS IS A COMPANY WHO FAILS ITS CUSTOMERS BIG TIME !"
561|"I cannot believe how bad their customer service. OK gas is gas and electricity is electricity but customer service matters too. Unfortunately this is inflexible. As an example, they would not allow me to change my meter reading date to bring it into line with my energy tracking. For online customers, the website is genuinely atrocious; it's counter-intuitive and often broken. Right now I am unable to access my latest bill even though it the site has accepted my meter readings and shows a hefty GBP400 credit built up for the winter. Never, never again. It was a big mistake moving to SP. Oh yes: and I asked for a call back but the website said ""computer says no"". Grrrrrrrrrrrrr."
562|They promise you a good deal but when you join them they charge what they like and trying to contact them takes ages,and if you are lucky enough to get through to someone ,they tell you that you are in the wrong department and they will call you back when they are not so busy ,but its not going to happennot a good company and dreadful customer service
563|I transferred my energy accounts to them in Oct-2011.  they make mistake after mistake, there customer service and complaints systems are rubbish.  I am now with another provider but I am still trying to resolves my charges with them.  I have gone to the ombudsman now, but they still keep ringing and threatening to cut me off???  AVOID THEM THEY ARE PANTS
564|I'm a landlord and evicted a bad tenant. S.P. had changed meters to pre-payment ones and wanted GBP110 to change back to credit meters. Instead I topped up pre-payment ones but when I tried to use the gas or electric the credit had gone. S.P. were deducting standing charges and last tenants debts.They know he's gone and eventually agreed to update their records and the nasty letters. Three months later the letters have started  again. The worst company utility company I've dealt with. 
565|Arranged a fixed price contract in April 2013,  Fixed until April 2015.  Received a contract to confirm this. Sept 2013, the emailed us stating that they were changing us to a standard contract at a higher tariff.  After numerous phone calls, complaints raised, they have still not replied to our complaint.  As far as I am concerned this company is acting dishonestly.   How many other peoples contracts have they changed, trusting that they will roll over and pay the new rate.  P.S told us that even though they were breaking our contract, that they would charge us for the pleasure of moving.  Where is the ombudsman in all this?
566|3 days trying to contact by e.mail and phone will not accept account number
567|Over charging: Criminal!!! I dont know how this company is getting away with it. Disgusting. Do not join
568|"On-line Dual Fuel customer paying by monthly direct debit.Service acceptable,unless you need to contact Customer Services for assistance.Service became non existant after transfer to another provider.Original termination account from SP included spurious charges showing my account in debit..After extensive emails/phone calls etc,SP finally issued revised final account,confirming I was in credit to approx GBP60.00.( but no apology or explanation for the mistake )Six weeks later,after numerous emails/phone calls and promises to ""call you back"" etc,still awaiting refund .Can only assume never ending wait on customer service phone lines is caused by an avalanche of customers trying to leave this company !First experience with SP and definately my last.No communication or explanation from SP,just silence. "
569|I have been with Scottish Power a number of years on their dual fuel standard tariff and apart from paying my bills by monthly direct debit, Ive not really had any contact with them.Having got my latest bill last month, I noticed that I was in credit by some GBP300 but at the same time, there was an accompanying letter indicating that they would be raising my monthly bill by around 30 per cent from October this year.I currently pay around GBP64 a month in total and this would be going up to GBP85 a month.The necessity to raise my monthly direct debit by so much clearly does not make sense, given that I am in credit by so much.So I decided to give Scottish Power a call, one to ask if I could have a refund on the amount in credit, and secondly to ask if I would be better off on a different tariff.That's when the problems started.Now, I had read elsewhere that they are not contactable, but its actually true!I have spent at least 20 minutes on the phone on several occasions on different days trying to get through to a phone agent but to no avail.I have also sent them several emails on a daily basis, but I have had no contact back, not even an email acknowledging my emails.Nothing at all.They also have an online facility on their website whereby you can contact them, but this does not work either.....when you enter your a/c no, it keeps coming up that you've entered a wrong a/c no.If you don't believe me, try it.I have even emailed them to say that I will be writing to their CEO, but again, no contact from them, not a jot!Well, I did some research on other review sites and its clear that this experience is quite normal.Either they don't want to know or their service facilities have completely collapsed. Appalling and also quite disturbing!I have reached the stage now where I have no choice but to change supplier in the hope that I can get a better service elsewhere.My best advice would be to avoid Scottish Power like the plague.Scottish Power.....another example of a great British Company!
570|I tried to leave Scottish Power in April, but they just delayed things constantly. The stated 6 weeks became 12 weeks and they just blamed me and then in the next breath, they blamed my new supplier. I was accused of not paying my gas bill in time, but I was a duel fuel customer and had somehow managed to pay my electricity bill. The statements show that both electricity and gas were paid for at the same time and the electricity moved after 8 weeks (the gas was due to switch 3 days later). The gas finally switched a month later, in July. The final bill is an amount that is agreed between the old and new supplier, but it is not a meter reading, merely a fantasy figure that Scottish power come up with. The estimated figure for gas usage amounts to about 3 months more gas than I had used. It is now September and I still have another 17 units to go before I reach the figure that Scottish power have given to debt collectors. Apparently, consumer law means nothing and they can do what they want. Sainsbury Energy have supplied the correct figures, but Scottish power have just ignored them. I have been told that when a figure is estimated and it amounts to more than the actual meter reading, the customer has a choice of paying the final bill, and then the new supplier doesn't charge you until you reach the actual reading that was estimated (not much chance you would want to pay a company that has been ripping you off!!!, so second option). The other option is to supply the actual figures and request an accurate final bill. Sainsbury energy have supplied those figures to Scottish and they just ignore them, so the actual energy market is a fraud when they give guideline times to switch, but the old company can then estimate as many months as they wish and harass you for a debt that doesn't legally exist. Scottish power are really best avoided. They have tantrums when you complain and blame everybody but themselves. The executive office is no better. Only complain to them if you want to be blamed for everything. It is obviously my fault that I didn't use enough energy to reach their stupid estimates in the first place!!! If I could give a negative overall rating, it would be minus 10 Stars!!!
571|worst customer service ever. as everyone else says. calling from oversea, i think my phone bill has covered the money they owed me
572|On hold for 30mins rang back and was still on hold! Very expensive energy services I do not like! Are Scottish power going to pay for my phone bill as well???
573|"After closing my account this company owed me GBP75, after waiting one month without refund I attempted to contact them by phone , I waited for 30 minutes on three separate occasions ,all I heard,from a machine was ""your call will be answered asap"" I am still waiting. I have been unable to contact online because my account is closed and not recognised..SCOTTISH POWER ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN GETTING HOLD OF YOUR MONEY.CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE"
574|I was asked for meter readings yesterday evening, 7 days before my standing order was due, to find that the new readings I submitted, triggered a GBP28 per month increase in my standing order. Having asked for an early call back at 1135 (!) the following morning (sounds like they were dealing with loads of queries) to discuss the situation, I received a call from a disinterested person from their call centre, who asked a few details, listened and then hung up as I was explaining my query... this is the first and worst customer service I have ever come across.  Scottish power must have a serious staff morale issue, which is directly affecting their customer support.  I will swap as soon as I can!
575|Beware, these sharks quote a monthly fee, you sign up, and two months later the up the direct debit by 30-40%. At the end of the year you find that you are in credit by a huge amount, in my case GBP400+.  The only way you'll ever get this back is by leaving them. I am at present preparing papers to take them to County Court. My research on social media has uncovered 23 incidents such as this so far.DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM, IT WILL COST YOU DEARLY.
576|THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST ENERGY PROVIDER. They never return calls, leave you hanging around and constantly say you use more energy even after final bills. i am now taking this company to the onbusman and i will not pay a penny if everyone avoided this company they would go into liquidation. Pleas please cut all your dealings with this company who are corrupt money grabers and customer services is a joke a member of staff actually actually laughed at me on phone. I am so angry and apauled. They are not even worth 1 star rating  
577|We had been getting emails until 15th May not had any since so hadn't realised they had put us on standard tariff and put the direct debit up from GBP44.00 to GBP53.00 per month when challenged they said 2 emails had been sent to me saying our contract was coming to an end and that they had mailed us telling us of the increase. I checked they had the right address and asked them to send me a test email still not got it. I am receiving emails as normal from all other companies and my email provider can't find any reason why we shouldn't be getting them. It is very annoying at the least has anybody else experienced the same. The only way I can see whats going on is to log in to my Scottish Power Account.  
578|I agree wholeheartedly and have empathy for scottish power customers. The reason you can't get through is the management make a habit of disciplining and sacking staff who try to do their all for customer which means you get suspended on full pay but less people to answer calls. Unfortunately a culture of fear and intimidation is prevalent. Those sacked are replaced by agency staff who to be honest couldn't care less.Very poor and if you speak to someone they either won't know anything be in fear of their job or completely demotivated.Enjoy!!
579|2 direct debits for GBP119 have come out of my account a day after each other, tried to call yesterday afternoon. After being on hold for 35 minutes I hung up and submitted form on web site , still waiting for call back !!! I have now been on hold for 26 minutes and still listening to music :( Poor customer service Scottish Power !! 
580|I have been waiting on the phone now 30 minutes and still waiting, all I have heard so far is your call will be answered as soon as possible. I have been a customer of Scottish Power for over 8 years, but lately the phone waiting time has got worse. Such a shame for the Customer Service is brilliant, I have found the tariffs to be fair. I am debating about moving, I was stuck with First Utility for a while when I first moved in the house and that was a nightmare.
581|I have used the form on their website twice requesting a phone back call and have heard nothing.Tried phoning the company several times and waiting on the phone for more than 30 minutes each time or they say they will call you back between 2 hours and 4 hours but guess what they don't!Avoid at all costs. At least go with someone where you know you will get through to an adviser with enough time.
582|The worst customer service that I have experienced from energy suppliers. Their staff are inept, to say the least. Expect to ring at least five times and speak to at least five people before you get to anybody who even does the thing they promise they will do.For example, I spoke to 6 individuals over about 4 phone calls JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD OUR ADDRESS CORRECTLY. That's right, despite my putting my address in the online application, they take your post-code and use that along with your house number to make an address. Example: 84 Woodville House, Dance Lane, Wigglesbottom, AB2 4HG. They would send the letters etc to 84 Dance Lane, ab2 4hg. I don't actually comprehend why they get so angry when you try to tell them your actual address, despite THEIR absolute failure to get it right in the first place. This is only the shallowest level of their ineptitude. It would take an essay to explain everything.They promise to be cheaper than other suppliers, and to keep your prices constant throughout your contract. Lie and lie. They knew our energy patterns, by the way, and charged us GBP110 for a 3 bed flat gas and electric IN THE SUMMER MONTHS. Entirely ridiculous.I utterly despise this company and I strongly encourage you to think a thousand times over before going anywhere near Scottish Power.
583|Do not even contemplate using this firm. They have so many tariffs all of which are more expensive than their rivals. They withdraw any amount of cash from your account without your consent even when you have sacked them. They are not to be trusted, avoid at all costs.
584|NEVER USE SCOTTISH POWER TO ANYBODY CONSIDERING USING THEM AVOIS LIKE THE PLAGUE THEY ARE USELESS, RUDE, INEPT AND COMPLETELY USELESS....
585|I moved my gas and electricity accounts to Scottish Power several months ago. They seem completely unable to handle the simple task of the transfer. Closing readings have been lost or radically changed from the ones I gave them. It does not seem to matter that the spurious readings would mean that I had used over 20,000kw.h of energy overnight...They are very curt and suspicious in their dealings on the telephone and seem to think that all of the errors are my fault.I have used several energy companies in the past and not been put to anything like this amount of effort or heartache.Rest assured, I will be leaving Scottish Power at the earliest possible opportunity and would not recommend anyone taking their energy bills there - regardless of anything Money Saving Expert may say!
586|I have recently moved from Scottish power to edf energy!when I rung up Scottish power to give my final meter reading the  person on the other end told me I would receive a final bill of no more than GBP80 well what a load of rubbish I have just got my final electric bill of GBP240 and that not all the final gas bill is yet to arrive so god no,s what that will be and this is after I were told that for both my gas and electric it would be no more than GBP80 to settle my account....there customer service team rang me today and said if u come back we will give u your GBP50 cancellation fee what u have been charged  haha what a joke didn't even no I had been charged that as well!!!! Tell ya something tho will never be going back to this company again so if I was u would stay well clear and to think I have been a customer for about 5 years with these people!!!!!!!!
587|"I have been with Scottish Power for many years, but when things go wrong, beware there customer service is terrible in fact its almost non existent, you will spend long periods on the phone listening to Adele, and if you do request a call back the chances are the person who calls you back will not be able to deal with your problem and transfer you to another dept and yes you guessed it "" more Adele"". they are just appalling."
588|I switched to Scottish Power, from Southern Electric, as they were offering a cheaper deal.  Oh how I wish I hadn't!!  I should have read these reviews first.Getting hold of anyone on the telephone, or getting replies to emails, is a nightmare.  I have wasted sooo much time, and I've only been with them for 3 months.I have Standard Electricity and Economy 7, ie two meters.  They reversed the final readings supplied by Southern Electric and refused to believe which meter was which.  As a consequence, all the readings were incorrect and they notified me that they would be increasing my monthly direct debit from GBP66 to GBP133.  I DON'T THINK SO!!!  I live in a one-bed property and the error is theirs, not mine.I FINALLY got it sorted this morning, after requesting a ringback.The only good thing about SP is that I can switch companies with no cancellation charge (allegedly)... and I'm going to do just that.In summary, if you want an easy life, avoid Scottish Power.
589|"Scottish Power are a DISGRACEunprofessional, argumentative and unhelpful.I rang up to initial cancel but they persuaded me to stay by giving me a cheaper option to pay monthly "" YEAH YEAH"" APPARENTLY I HAD SOOOOOOOOOO much credit so I was advised by the adviser to pay only GBP50 a month. 7 mouths later they withdrew GBP800 and did not even tell me I had to call up and still they did not know what was going on they told me they made a mistake and I am in debit and I owe them GBP800. GBP800 was taken out of my account by scottish power without any any notification DO NOT GIVE THEM ACCESS TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. As far as I am AS I KNOW that is theft . To make this matter worse the two customer advisers where so rood and argumentative they would know service even if it hit them in the face. I was on the phone in total for about 3 hours.This is the kind of rubbish and stress that I do not need. This company and there staff are a disgrace talking to people like rubbish to get there money that they HAVE FORCED people out of. So I am lumbered with a huge bill that I have to pay Disgraceful . CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ABOUT DOING WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP YOUR CUSTOM NOT what I got roundness and arguing with me telling me its my fault derrrrrrrrrrr stop estimating your reading HE APPARENTLY WHENT ON TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE DONE IT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE  "
590|I am not a scottish power customer, but they keep taking over my electricity supply without my consent, i am with another supplier and scottish power keep cancelling my agreement with my supplier!!! I am absolutly livid, i have rung them and am reasured my account is cancelled, but they still continue the same, i am at the end of my teather and don't know what to do:-(
591|"This may not be the biggest bill you've seen but I just wanted people to be aware of these people.2 bed small terrace with minimum appliances both work during the day and go to bed at approx. 22:30I recently received an estimated bill of GBP106 which is double my usual bill.  I called to query the price hike. I was asked for my meter readings and they then stated I have been underpaying for two years and now owe GBP3000.  I have had at least 6 home visits from ""engineers"" and have filled in and displayed every readings card they have posted.I asked the question ""if I owed that amount why haven't you contacted me earlier"" Sarahs response was ""we tried to call you but couldn't reach you"".In my eyes if they knew about the value of arrears why not send a letter or put the amount on my account?At the end of the day:-They reduced my payments and put my account in creditI have given every reading I have been asked forTheir engineers have their own readingsThey say they have had only one reading in 3 years so who were the people in my house?BEWARE...."
592|I cannot under any circumstances recommend Scottish Power.  You'd think for the top-end prices they pay, they could afford some training for their (rude) staff, and they could spend some money on a website that is user-friendly and isn't really slow and logs you out repeatedly.  Maybe criticism of the site is because I'm a web developer; but I'd be ashamed to put my name to it.
593|In 6 months I was overcharged 4 times. The costumers service people are extremely rude and unhelpful, when I changed services and they realized that I was not renewing or recommending anyone they literary hang the phone while I was talking. And finally after 2 months and about 5 calls (three of them to try to close the account)I am still after the refund I am owed for overpaid bills...All they care about is money, they don't care at all for the costumer and will anything to empty you pockets (to whatever means necessary).
594|I called Scottish Power boiler cover this morning (Friday) to ask for someone to call out to fix my boiler. I have no heating or hot water and they promised someone would be with me today!  I took a day off work as I needed this fixing urgently.  At 5.00 pm I got a phone call saying that someone would be out on Sunday morning to fix it! I informed the person on the phone that I had been promised a call out today, however, she said that was the earliest it could be done! I phone Scottish Power and asked what was going on, then the woman said I was priority and then offered me a call out on Monday!!! I told them that my one year old grandson was staying over tomorrow, and that my partner who works in a garage and who will be covered in filler dust and oil would need a shower when he comes home, but - NOT INTERESTED. I asked if this was their Emergency Cover, and she said it was! What a joke! 
595|Back in January Scottish Power estimated by joint energy Quarterly Charge to be GBP10,570, I complained immedietly and after a day or so they recalculated and gave me a credit for GBP9689, discovering that the Electricity was incorrect. Yesterday, the latest Quarterly Charge came through as +GBP10,600, once again a massive over-charge. On checking via my own spreadsheet (which I set up after the last time) I estimate that the charge for Gas is near enough correct, but the Electric should be circa GBP345. Therefore, I am now chasing a credit of approx GBP9,700.   Should be interesting what they respond with tomorrow. No-one there today, as it's Sunday.
596|"No idea how, but my ""prepayment meter"" got me a charge for GBP190 for a month. Their estimated use was 500 units out, and we paid them GBP30 to use GBP30 worth of electric. No idea how they arrived at us owing them this much money. They should've been fined a LOT more than their paltry GBP15m. Now I know how they raked in GBP1.5 billion in profits last year - robbery!"
597|Awful customer service! Poor service from the switchboard at headoffice, I got moved onto person to person no so called advisors know what they are doing! I would advise noone to bother phoning them, you will be on the phone for 1   hours with no help! 
598|I have been rung up 4 times during the past two days from a sales person trying to get me to swap, have had to put in a formal complaint now because he wouldn't stop calling, these people are a menace.
599|My daughter has a key meter, she came home saturday afternoon and the electric was off..she couldnt find her key so we rang the so called emergency number,to try and get the code for a new key, after umpteen calls it turns out its tough...if you have no electric between 1pm saturday and 8am monday then you have no electric and you have to get on with it...shes lost a freezer full of food and has a 3 year old child...lucky we her parents were around, we had to bring them here ..if that had been an old person with no family or friends, from saturday to monday ..no heating no way of cooking food then what could potentially happen to them....they have have been good in customer service when i spoke to them today and have returned phone calls it is just this policy which seems ridiculous and it seems most people are unaware of this.
600|Absolutely disgusted with Scottish Power.  Was a customer with them for 2 years and could not wait to move.  Customer service was appalling, price rise was ridiculous, just getting a hold of someone is nearly impossible. I finally completed my move from Scottish Power mid-january and never received a final bill.  I'm a novice and thought the supplier I was moving to would arrange all the details. I then noticed that Scottish Power took another DD payment on the 1st of Feb, I figured that was fair enough as I assumed that was my final bill.  I was shocked however when come the 1st of March, they took another DD Payment. I rung up to see what happened only to be told it's my responsibility to cancel the DD.  I understand this however they shouldn't be requesting money in the first place! I asked the adviser to stop requesting money, which she advised she couldn't until the account was finalised.  I asked her to finalise my account, she then advised this was done in the middle of January and that my account was in credit.  I then asked why they were still taking money if the account had been finalised and I was in credit.  She then huffed and hung up the phone. Dunno about Scottish Power, but if I were ever to hang up on one of our customers (or even ex-customers), I'd be given the sack!I now have to call up again to request I get my money back! 
601|I have dealt with many energy companies in my work capacity and I must say Scottish Power have the most confusing billing system I have come across.  Last year I switched my home energy to Scottish Power after them calling at my doorstep and offering much lower price to that of Southern Electric.  It was basically a fix and I was no better off. At the end of September my account was GBP400 in credit as I pay monthly direct debit and they had been really over estimating my bills.  I have just got a new bill in which I am in the process of checking.  The bill says I have used GBP250(?!!) in energy which still leaves my account GBP150 in credit.  Today a letter arrives saying I am not paying enough money in direct debit to cover my bill and therefore they are putting the charge up from GBP76.00 per month to GBP95.00 per month!!!!  This is the final straw and I am today looking to change suppliers.  
602|IT started off good i was on a pay as you go meter then when i moved from the property it started of with a estamated bill(GBP40) then i had the meater changed (but it wasnt changed when where there, not my property so i cud not ov dun that it wud ov had to be the landlord) then it when up to GBP2000 i disputted that i was on a pre paid meter then it started to drop from 2000 down to 1500 then 500 because i was ringin them often to say there not getin a penny they went after the landlord the landlord squashed it when he got his lawyer on it then thay came after me again and becuse i kept telling them there not geting a penny my name was removed from the bill an it was just my partners name left on the bill now she is getting threatened with debt collectors, by all means DO NOT GO WITH SCOTTISH POWER THE GOOD REVEWWS ARE FROM PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THEM PRETENDING TO BE CUSTOMERS. 
603|They always try to charge u more then u use electricity,alleays sent estimate bill which terrible big,u have to fight for ur money.Horrible provider...,never again and I will ever advise to my friends... 
604|"Should you ever need to contact Scottish Power Customer Services expect to be on the phone for a very long time, being put on hold, being transfered from one agent to the other, having to repeat your story over and over. If they promise to call you back,you've no chance, forget it! If you use their online live chat service, make sure you have at least an hour to waste because, although the agent seems to want to help, she will probably be unable to track down the correct person who ""can"" (joke??) deal with your problem. I am currently going through this process because Scottish Power are trying to charge me a sum which, apparently,somehow, accumulated AFTER I had moved from the premises in question. The main issue, however, is the complete inefficiency of the company in dealing with problems with accounts."
605|"If get the following:1.  Escalating payments and high bills2.  Are told you are using more in the summer than the winter3.  You build up a nice sum over summer to help you over the winter and it all disappears in a bill,then you possibly have a meter fault. After going on and on at them, their complaints department finally put a ""piggy back"" meter in and after a couple of months and hard work by one the people in the department, the meter was found to be faulty.  I am now owed GBP181.00. I was all for giving Scottish Power the boot because they didnt listen in the beginning but I raised a complaint and stuck with it.  However, apart from the one person who helped with this, I fear they have customer service issues that need addressing when these type of complaints arise."
606|I use SP for boiler cover and i have had nothing but trouble with them. The staff are completely useless and dont have basic customer service skills. I have used up all holidays at work for these people and boiler still not fixed. Their contactors dont turn up when they are supposed to and dont ring you to tell you they are not coming. Scottish Power wont take responsibility for their contactors they expect me to contact them directly but I dont pay them I pay SP. Been down the complaints route which was a waste of time, they are not interested in anything you have to say. I have previously been told my policy was void as parts required were no longer available but with 1 simple call i made to the to the manufacturer, magically the parts were available and was told parts have to be available by law for at least 10 years, wouldnt you think SP would know this. I honestly believe they dont want to cover me and they lied about the parts so i would cancel the policy. Boiler is only 6 years old!They may be the cheapest but you get what you pay for, saying that, you dont get what you pay for with this company, stay clear of them!
607|We moved into our rented property in mid December and have just received a bill for one month from Scottish Power it equates to GBP190, I have no idea how Scottish Power can charge this amount for a three bed house with the only gas supply being to the boiler, and when we are both out at work all day?? GBP190 for a month??? When I called the customer services the first person I spoke with agreed that this was a high amount and for me to check the reading etc, when I called back to say that these were correct the second customer service person thought that it was quite a reasonable amount!!!Well I certainly do not.Luckily as part of the rental contract we have to move our supplier to their recommended supplier. So hopefully we will have no more sky high bills.I think that the regulators should look into this and as we both work we can afford such a price however if we were on benefits then I dread to think what we would do.Sort it out.
608|Elderly neighbour could ring out for 4 days only then next 5 plus days no service.  Had to ring 0845 number - very expensive - to repeatedly find out what happening.  Why is it 0845 number!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  Fault is with provider.  Not only no servce but having to pay premium rates for holding on etc. NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  Normal number is needed for emergency and faults!!!!!!!!!!
609|Inaccurate and conflicting information on many web pages.  Trying to determine what tariff you are paying is akin to studying as a Philadelphia Lawyer long, painful and confusing.  This is a prime example of why the government is simplify the utility services.Trying to change the tariff/service on the telephone is even worse!  My recent experience was abysmal, I was on the phone for nearly 30 minutes and put on hold no less than eight times , I eventually gave up. 
610|Just see the rating - 14% of the result speaks for itself. very arrogant customer service, throwing the phone after a few words, total incompetence, fraud notorious billings, still calls for payment for bills already paid - nightmare! the whole happiness joined another company, it will calm them!no like this!!
611|The staff and management have no ability to communicate remedial actions concerned with their totally incompetent systems for energy supply and customer communications. The repeatedly fail to rectify their own errors. Their complaint remedy procedures are utterly useless. Their senior staff do not have the common courtesy to reply to personal serious complaint letters addressed to them. The board members should consider there positions. DO NOT TOUCH THIS COMPANY WITH A VERY LARGE BARGE POLE!
612|Do not get involved with this energy company. I was with them 1 year too long. Now I have switched company my bills are 20% lower. They claimed to hold prices and then cynically increased them, their idea of customer service is to say the same thing over again until you shut up. They billed me six months after I switched and then failed to understand a genuine dispute and put a threatening customer collection agency not me who bombarded me with texts emails and threats. They apparently do not know that It takes 12 positive service experiences to make up for one negative experience. Don't be another one to prove it to them stay away- they will use hard sell techniques and then let you down.I have had to pay them money I don't think I owe them to stop their harassment. Be warned and listen to a Customer experience you don't want to have!Scottish Power be warned you are bullies but you have not heard the last!
613|If you need to get in touch with Scottish Power customer services, be prepared for very lengthy and costly phone calls. Be prepared to have to call them back several times and always take their promises with a large spoonful of salt. You will never be able to talk to the same agent, so be prepared to have to explain your problem from scratch each time you call them. The agents never seem to be able to understand what the previous agent you spoke to was trying to do. Complete chaotic and utterly frustrating.
614|I recently tried to move to Scottish POwer from British Gas - They messed the whole thing right up,from the startcausing me no end of problems - numerous phone calls and emails. When I spoke to a customer service team member i encountered i the rudest customer service rep - I have ever spoken to, who I ended up putting the phone down on.I have since moved back to British Gas and they are still causing problems by delaying the move backto British Gas and passing on incorrect meter point numbers.You would be better of with Laurel & Hardy than these idiots - Stay clear.
615|Contrary to other reviews on here, I've only ever had good experiences with Scottish Power - unlike British gas and E.on, who I had previously used. The transfer process worked fine, I received emails updating me on progress and now I submit my meter readings on their website and can view my consumption and bills. Their prices seem very competitive and I also read a couple of reports in Which? magazine which rated them top of the enrgy companies for customer service!
616|Scottish power is the  worst company I have come across in a while.  They sub contract most of their work to snmaller companies who are unreliable and dishonest.  Over the past six months we've had 4 different companies and 17 visits.   yes 17.  16 of those visits were a waste of time as nothing was done. Each one spouting a different tune. . None of them arrived with any idea why they were here and so did not have the correct parts or tools.  One company said they had installed something when they hadn't and were subsequently fired by Scottish power...supposedly. The last company installed the new boiler and we cancelled our boilers cover with Scottish power and got a very small compensation offer as they refused to take any responsibility for the six months of mess. Now four months on the boiler is leaking and losing pressure as it was clearly not installed properly.  The company that installed it no longer exists and Scottish power is refusing to do anything about it because....you guessed it...we cancelled our cover!  They don't seem to care that we were covered when the installation took place and the installation was faulty.  It is like pulling teeth and I will never deal with them again and advise anyone else not to touch them with a barge pole. 
617|They are charging me 59 GBP a week I can't understand why it's horrible service I don't recommend to know one for sure the customer service is discussting they don't even try to help you or understand your problem .  No more words 
618|Scottish Power continued to take money from my bank account after ceasing to be my supplier and even though my dual fuel account was in credit with them. They then closed my complaints file because they had returned the money owing on the day the supply was transferred even though they had not reimbursed me for the extra they had taken after the transfer date. They explained - in an email that was apparently supposed to settle my complaint - that because they did not know I had a new supplier they were entitled to continue taking money from my bank account until they were told. This means I have paid two different suppliers for the same energy for the whole of one month. When I escalated my complaint they held onto my email for a week and then replied to say that it had not been read. I have had no alternative but to write to the chief executive and the customer services director by priority mail, but this should not be necessary.
619|Scottish Power have developed an obsession that a company that I have never heard of is based at my address.   I have sent them two letters and two emails pointing this out, but Scottish Power have simply ignored them.  Is this arrogance, incompetence or both?   I have never been a customer of Scottish Power and get my energy from a completely different company.   Has anyone reported them to the gas regulator?   
620|A few years ago I switch from britsh gas to Scottish Power due to britsh gas charging me 3 times for one bill and after 2 months of being with scottish power They tried charging me for the same bill so I switched to eon. Which i was happy with them and can't remember why i decided to leave them and went back to scottish power. After being with them for month GBP15 on my meter that is put on there every week was being swallowed up. Yesterday I recived 3 invoice's that all stated that i was in GBP20 and even GBP90 in credit when i phoned up to recive it in a cheq they refused and said thats not how it works and now they stated that im only in 62p in credit. Not only that but at 10am in the morning i went on emergency one day as i had run out poped to the shop and put GBP10 on the meter which straight away went down to GBP5.50 when i phoned the lady said that it wasn't right we will refund us GBP5.00 and gave us a code that didn't work. Today i decided to quetion it to which he said that it because of using emergncy. What a load of RUBBISH!!!! Im totally dispointed with this company and the way they have spoke to me and ripped me of. My advice is don't use them they will ripp you of and speak down to you!!!!!!!!
621|I have signed a contract for GBP41 back in April, that it was supposed to be fixed price everymonth. Today I found that they have taken from my account GBP138, I havent received any notice or any letter since April saying  that this tariff may vary and that I need to send them my meter readings. I called today and after waiting for 40 minutes on the phone the lady told me that as I havent sent the readings they took an estimate of what I am apparently used since April and my direct debit is going to be change to match my comsuption per month. Also if you want to log in with your customer name it never works so its impossible to get anything solved. I have to go and take the meter readings and I have already been waiting on the phone for over an hour. 
622|I like to get the best fixed price deal! With Scottish Power from 2008-2011 and boy were they bad. Terrible website, multiple errors, constant inflated estimated bills. I then had 12 months with NPower who were absolutely superb! A faultless 12 months on a great fixed price tarrif.However end of July 2012, had to go back to Scottish Power on their Nov 13 Fixed which was the best in the UK at the time, I did beat the NPower price hike so it worked...But its taken from 27th July until Nov 2 to transfer with multiple errors along the way. Instead of using my reading on date of transfer they used an estimated, so this resulted in a GBP150 bill from NPower which was wrong. 4 weeks to sort that out. They send you a personal webpage, that was broken, twice. And today I went to submit my monthly reading (to prevent extortionate estimated bills) and couldn't do it online because they had not entered the meter serial number I had given twice previously.Just out and out inept employees and hassle with Scottish Power. Be prepared to run your own show.  
623|"I recently used a known website to switch electricity and gas supply to Scottish Power. I received a welcome email from Scottish Power on the 16th of October. I also received a Welcome pack by post on the 17th October, dated 15th of October.On the 19th October I sent a cancellation notice email to Scottish Power well within seven working days of receiving their Welcome email  (as per the instructions on their own email from 16th October) and promptly received an automated response saying that they had received my email and would respond  within 48 hours On the 23rd October Scottish Power sent me an email saying: ""Your cooling off period of 7 days has now passed as you signed the contract on 11th October 2012. The transfer of your supply is now in progress."" The Welcome pack I received by post on the 17th October, dated 15th of October, informed me that if I want to cancel my contract i must tell them ""within seven working days from the date you receive this pack"".Scottish Power are clearly lying that my cooling off period has passed and are refusing to accept my cancellation notice. They also lied to me on the phone twice that they had switched me to a fixed tariff, when they had not.Please do not let this company bully you. I will keep you posted!"
624|I have been with Scottish Power for about 4 years and have seen a steady decline in their service.  I have not had any sort of notification of what I owe or whether they owe me i.e. no bill for about a year.  Whatever time of day I ring them I am put on hold for an unacceptable amount of time and so far have not managed to speak to anyone.  May I suggest that management employ a few of the many millions looking for work in order to properly staff their telphone service or is this a ploy to lead us all onto the web so that we do the work for nothing. This company is a complete shambles - sign up with them at your peril.
625|"I hit hard times, had to have card meter fitted and owed GBP470 in arrears. I hold my hands up.  It was agreed that they would debit a set amount from the meter each week until clear. Simples!...... or was it?!They told me that I could top up using laptop and sold me a dongle for GBP15.00 which never worked.  They forgot to set the meter to pay back the debt and then started to pursue me, I received a number of letters that didnt make sense, when I called them they were apologetic. However the letters kept coming!When I switched over to card meters they sent me final statements on what I owed and it came to GBP470, thereafter I bought payg credit and thought that would be the end of it? NO! last night they sent a demand for GBP670?! I felt sick and angry and felt there had to be a mistake. Called them and after a 40 minute call they said Oh yes thats because you have not provided meter readings?!?!  However I didnt know I had to since Im now a token meter customer?!?!?!    they said that because there were no meter readings supplied they guessed a figure and then demanded it from me. If anyone knows how I complain about these bunch of ""@;: please let me know. "
626|"This is brilliant.  I have just moved to SP.  They send me an email on the 10th saying they need my opening meter reading; they say they need it ""at the moment"".  The 'personalised website' {guffaw} they have set up for me to transfer says I can give them this reading ""between the 11th and 21st"".  I try but it gives me an 'access forbidden' message.  After holding on the phone for ..... way too long..... and giving up I email them.  After 2 days they bother to send a reply; apparently I'm only a pending customer until a later date and 1) they don't need my reading until this later date and 2) I can't give them the reading during all the dates they mention on my 'personalised website'.Pure, simple stupidity.  You'd think it's more difficult to be this incompetent than to get something right: not the for the geniuses at Scottish Power."
627|"I AM OVER 70 YRS OF AGE AND WAS WITH SCOTTISH POWER UNTILL THEY PUT UP THEIR COSTS SO I CHANGED . THEY THEN SENT ME A BILL FOR NEARLY GBP500 STATING THAT I USED TO MUCH GAS AND ELECTRIC. WHY COULD THEY NOT TELL ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD UP DATE MY DIRECT DEBIT. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DO NOT CONTACT YOU. THEY CANCELLED MY DIRECT DEBIT STATING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS AVAILABLE "" RUBBISH ""  I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE NOT TO GO WITH SCOTTISH POWER."
628|All i have to say is your staff is a joke i have been on and off the phOne since saturdsy this is nw thursday as i have no gas. I was told it wasnt getting treated as an emergency tell me this so having a one yr old no heating no gas to cook or hot water and thats not an emergency yous are a joke was then told when i cslled back for about the tenth time they couldnt find a record of it all woman tells me she will call bk in 10mins am still waiting 3hrs later so i called back and got the mOst helpful guy called phil 5782 he seen everything on computer and has cased them up all i can say is thanks to phil im getting this sorted inventually
629|I pay by key for electric and care for gas basically a pay as you go meter. I turned back to Scottish power a few months ago to try and save money as I'm a single parent to to two children. I found recently that I was constantly putting in money well eating it as soon as I put it in but not much electric and gas was being used as I was trying to use it efficiently as I could. I'd basically had enough today and got on the phone to them they told me because I hadn't topped up my meter because I was trying to save myself some money I incurred charges on the machine. But when I went to try and use my emergency credit nothing was there on many occasions so it was a quick phone call to another supplier literally begging to switch me over and get me from this horrid service I will meter go back to Scottish power they are a joke and so unhelpful no matter if your a single parent or. you are of. a different family background they should be helping people cut there costs.
630|Used to be with SSE and nPower however nPower never gave me a bill and tried to collect me for debt 3 times which was not mine and tried harrasment and kept cutting my Gas and Electrity off and SSE well refused to let me switch to a credit meter after when I was signing up I was told I would get to switch into a Credit Meter. Switched to ScottishPower after recommend by a friend who was with ScottishPower,  Never had a problem always give meter reading online and been with them for 2years and had 1 small problem at start but they fixed the problem quickly and gave me GBP20 M&S; Voucher.  I always call there 0800 number or use call back and always get to speak to somebody in the UK including emails I always get thru to somebody in the UK and I been told all there staff are British and not outside the UK. I also called them up last week to check I was getting best price and they were able to save me GBP50 a year by switching to the Online Fixed Price Energy plus my friend got a call from them asking she was okay about the service she got from ScottishPower. The Number is use 0800 027 0404.  I have put this feedback down as I you ALWAYS hear about when things go wrong but never hear when they get stuff right and I think more Happy customers should put good feedback down on these type of sites.   Please also note you never know the full story.   As reading a meter is not hard and just write all numbers down and they will work out whats the number you need use which is what I do plus if you actully went on ScottishPower website you get there freephone number and even on my bills so can't moan they try and hide the number. 
631|"I have recently switched to Scottish Power.My impression so far is ""Disappointing"".During the switch I have received emails asking me to input meter readings.But as soon as I try, their website rejects them as ""Not wanted"".I try to logon to my account and get told ""Not allowed to access"".So I entered readings by phone.  Their advisors didn't seem at all interested in my difficulties.  I had to press for my complaints to be logged.Their computer systems are plainly rubbish.I hope things improve or I will be Confused.com-ming again very soon."
632|When I phoned yesterday, I had the option of a 'callback' and did receive a call within 3 minutes.  Therefore, spent none of my time on-hold.  The man I spoke with was very knowledgable and helped me reduce my bill by 12%.  When I said my gas bill sounded much too high for the summer months, he asked me to check my meter and said he would phone back the next day between 1.00 and 2.00.  He phoned at 1.20!  Couldn't be more impressed with the service.
633|SirsYou have sent me an email explaining how good you are-well your not!I have been trying to get someone to help me read a meter.I have rang 4 times and been holding on for a total of 45 mins, You online assistant is rubbishI sent an email -no replyOnly this morning I finally got through to a lady  who had such a thick accent I had to ask her to over and over again to speak slowly so I could understand.We don't keep you hanging onOur UK-based Customer Service Team are trained to resolve your queries quickly and efficiently. During busy periods, we'll offer you a free call back rather than keep you on hold.NOT TRUE! NEVER had THIS OPTIONI going back to Br GasThey helped me with my feed in tariff request when you could not.
634|I switched from Scottish Power at the end of June, and received my final electricity bill on the 7th July, and my final gas bill on the 14th July. In total I was GBP180 in credit. I've emailed them and phoned repeatedly (at least I found a 0800 number for them. As of last Wednesday I was told that for some reason a refund had not been issued, but they would send me a cheque straight away. Guess what? No refund.I tried emailing the CEO, but have had no acknowledgement whatsoever, so it is easy to see where their rubbish customer service comes from.Avoid if you don't want hassle.
635|This company not only repeatedly call you even when your with them, asking if you want to join them. First tried launching an GBP800 bill from the previous tennants at us, then they didn't apologise. We left them, then in our next property were unfortunately lumped with them and tried having as little communication with them as possible. Said they would send me GBP15 compensation and gift for inconvenience, received GBP15 and no gift. Then messed up our gas and are still trying to charge us for previous tennants debt. When I call they have a different excuse for the rising debt. Also they did not make me aware, even after asking about weekly charges for the pay as u go. Just a disgusting company with no logic, commen sense or staf who will take ownership of a query. But then I suppose if the staff did then the company would have to pay for the staff to have the resources. Also the engineers they send out talk bad about them.
636|Just don't have anything to do with this company. The website doesn't work and when you try to make contact my email you get an answer from someone in India who doesn't understand English, and you just can't get through on the phone and instead have to listen to awful piped music for hours. They responded to my complaint by deleting my log in information so I couldn't log into my account.I have nothing good to say about this company - they are even worse than N-power!
637|Hi everyone my duel fuel was coming to the end of my contract. i went on to u switch who gave me scottish power. i rang them to make sure i was doing the right thing, because everyone knows how complicated your gas and electricity statements are.I had the most helpful telesales lady by the name michaela o hara, who spent approx 45mins going through the process of explaining all you need to know about gas and electricity.She was very competent about her job and extremly pleasant.I really wish they could all be like her.Michaela o hara deserves a pat on the back.thankyou for making the process so easy.kind regards!sharon jones
638|If you are in credit with Scottish Power you will struggle to get it refunded. I closed my account with Scottish Power as they stopped the tarriff I was on. I was threatened twice with penalty charges even though I had followed the procedure given by Scottih Powerfor closing the account. They stopped supplying me on 2nd of April when I had a credit of GBP90. It took until 30th July to get my refund with many emails and phone calls. My impression was that they do nothing until you phone them and then they will do the minimum. If you are not willing to chase them over refunds then don't go to them in the first place.
639|Stay well clear of Scottish Power! Their inept staff are rude, unhelpful and a complete waste of time to deal with. I was with them for a couple of years and nearly a year after leaving them, I'm still having to deal with their terrible customer service department, after they cocked up my account! 
640|Scottish Power is a rip off company  with TOTAL DISRESPECT FOR CLIENTS !! even clients safety with faulty wiring of there meters.  A call centre  where you wait  20 minutes  being billed by your phone company! Service is TOTALLY APPALLING.A TYPICAL CORPORATE COMPANY NO INTEREST EXCEPT MAKING GBPGBPGBPGBPGBPGBPGBPGBPGBPGBP 
641|First of all the company has been charging me on the wrong gas meter and has ended up overcharging me by GBP900!! The customer services team has made it incredibly difficult to reclaim this money (specifically customer service member Alex Polland). At times they promise to provide me a cheque, but later I find out that another team member of theirs then decided to hold the payment in order for them to carry out further investigation into their own incompetence!! Pure and simple this company has no sense of customer service and are a bunch of thieves, they should be investigated and prosecuted!!!
642|Scottish Power supply our gas and electricity and we also have a boiler cover plan with them. As part of the boiler cover plan they have an engineer come out and assess the quality of the boiler, to ensure it is fit for the cover. As part of this he mentioned that we needed a part replacing and that he would get this sorted asap for us. 1 month later we'd heard nothing and so rang Scottish Power (who had started charging us for the cover). They said they'd send out an engineer a couple of weeks later. On the due day no one turned up. Again we rang scottish power and they'd mixed up the dates and so would send someone out a couple of weeks later. We rang SP the day before the engineer was due to check they were still coming and that they were still scheduled for an afternoon visit, SP said that was correct.The next day we got a phone call at about 9am, whilst at work, saying the engineer would be over in 15 minutes. After explaining that we'd booked an afternoon appointment because we couldnt get the morning off work we were made to feel that this was all our fault. Despite having rung them just the day before to confirm the time of visit. So we re-scheduled another appointment, to which no one showed up AGAIN! For the final time we rang Scottish Power and re-scheduled. The engineer has just been and didn't have the part that needed replacing, so just 'took a look' at the boiler.We've had 3.5 days off work now and SP have not fixed anything. To top this off we've logged complaints with SP and they seem to be doing nothing about it. AVOID at all costs. Terrible service.
643|This company are the worst energy supplier available, there prices are the highest, there service is rubbish, and when you try to leave they keep billing you and blocking the new company, there bills are impossible to understand. They just demand money and give you no meter readings to follow. I,ve tried a few different companies but Scottish Power are by far the worst. What ever you do stay away from Scottish Power, I,m going over to Solar Panels and LPG Gas, it's the only way to send these rip off companies to the wall, were they all deserve to be, but none more so than Scottish Power..AVOID..
644|"I was wish Scottish Power for a year, they bill in advance on most domestic rates so you are normally GBP300 or so in credit with them.  I was on OnLine Energy Saver 11In October 2011 I swapped to npower.  Scottish Power then owed me 164 quid, 20 of that for gas 144 for electric.  It said on the bill ""We'll send a refund cheque within 10 days"".  Wow, however did you gues? Nothing arrived.I chased it in November, but then had to go away on business and the bills got buried in a stack of work papers which I found recently.I chased it four weeks ago.  Finally I got a check for GBP20 for the gas but nothing for the electric.  Chased it again, some weird excuse about having to cancel the original check (the phantom one) and then how the check was ""issued"" to me on the 22nd of May but ""issued"" means they send the data to their printers who then have another 10 working days to print it.  Meantime YOUR money sits in their accounts and you have a task you will have to take weeks to get off your to do list.Not worth all the hassle to save a few quid on electric bills.  Avoid them like the plague."
645|The worst customer service I have experienced. They increase your monthly direct debit with out warning. Avoid this company you have been warned!!!!
646|"I have recently moved to Scottish Power with an o-line dual fuel account and am already regretting it.  I was hugely in the black with payments to my old supplier and looking forward to a large refund. However, because of Scottish power's incompetence we have an impasse.I have supplied SP with my meter readings as requested (on-line at the same time, same date) They also sent a man to read the meter on-site.  I then received an acknowledgment and the move was complete.However, my old company is unable to complete their billing and return my refund because Scottish Power have not supplied them with the final meter reading.Scottish Power now claim they do not have it (although it was required to complete the move).This simply proves that their on-line system does not work and that supplying meter readings is pointless as they ""lose them""How they are now going to come to an agreed reading and sort the billing is a mysteryI feel that I have made a HUGE mistake moving to Scottish Power, as my old supplier gave me excellent service for several years.My advice is to stay clear of this company."
647|Terrible company to have as a supplier. They were very aggressive in the way the sales people try to hang on to your custom. There is an automatic adjustment to your direct debit payments which is fair enough but they make sure that they have your money upfront and you are well into the black. I switched supplier with 1 day left and they billed me for breach of contract. Would never use agin. AVOID!!!!
648|I have been a customer for two years since moving home and they have never been to read the meter - yet send a letter saying there was no-one at home, the house is occupied all day. I cannot enter a meter reading on-line because my reading is lower than the high estimate and this month to cap it all they have taken GBP225 from my DD account with no warning. I will be moving supplier tomorrow. 
649|There a far too many things to list as to why this company is so incredibly useless but I think the one that shows it best is that they did not replace  the leaking gas meter instead they sent out someone to change the electric meter, I called them immediately and was told they would call back, due to the danger I called national grid to replace the meter and they never called back....
650|If you dont have a DD set up you have to pay monthly payments which they set and is way over what you use. Dont make the payments (even when you settle the bill off every quarter) they send threating letters every month and ask for more. They also tell you that if you dont pay, you will be asked to move to another supplier. So stuff these cowboys, I moved.Kept getting the usual threating letters about the monthly payment, but I was awaiting my final bill. I got it .... oh, and two days later got a ltter stating that I was still legally bound to pay my monthly payment.Yeh right. I have gone to a company that treat you properly and not like a piece of scum. They are only interested in two things ... their bonus and big fat profits ... customer service ... zero. 
651|I recently took possession on a repossession home.  The energy supplier had to be established so the account could be put in the new name.  although the national data base and every other provider informed me that the supplier was Scottish Power it took me several hours yesterday and an incredible eight hours of constantly being passed from pillar to post having to start over each time with someone else.  I was reduced to tears of frustration.  The complaints department a now dealing with my complaint, however I do not hold out much hope but will keep you all informed.  The only time my query was taken seriously was when the provider thought that the electricity was being obtained fraudulently.
652|This has got to be the worst utility company ever.  They do not return phone calls.  They do not answer emails.  They send the wrong bills.  They do not take any note of your meter readings.  They always charge you via an estimated bill.  Even when their own meter readers read they meter they still send an estimated bill.  They do not set up direct debits.  They delete your online account.  They do not allow you to connect with their site using Mozilla.  Customer service is non existent.  Avoid at all cost.  An abysmal organisation.
653|I sent an e mail criticising the ethos of Scottish Power for their policy of immediately increasing my monthly direct debit as soon as my account was in debit, but never reducing it when in credit.  I mentioned that their calculation had failed to take the lower summer usage into account and that I was under the impression that one of the benefits of having the type of account that I have is not to worry about the changing cost of monthly payments, and have them spread out over the year.The response I received was quite shocking, judging from the name, I would say it was from an overseas centre and consisted of no fewer than 21 lines from right to left without any break or paragraphs of sheer gobbledeegook, which needless to day had not addressed my complaint and had almost certainly been generated from the touch of the operators button, to get rid of my complaint.I emailed back saying that I found their response to be an appalling and totally unprofessional reply which was a disgrace to their company, and asked for confirmation that my reply was generated by an automated process and if not who was responsible for sending it and what is their position in the organisation?Scottish Power have refused to reply to me.  I wonder if the same standards of  non-communication would kick in if I were not to pay my bill or by the customer retention department when they call me after I have closed the contract.
654|I have been a scottish power customer for 2 years. I originally joined as there was a cashback offer included in the low monthly price. The switch was easy and I didnt have to call once - I was sent regular updates via email.I have never had a problem submitting a meter reading.I recently emailed customer services for some information about my tarrif and got a reply within 2 days telling me everything I wanted to know.I have called customer services to discuss a direct debit increase that I was emailed about and they quickly acknowledged the mistake and changed it back. It was because my estimated bills had gone up over winter.Call center staff are friendly and helpful.Have found a cheaper deal with EDF this year but I would definitely return in future.
655|I phoned Scottishpower recently as I was seeking a new energy supplier. They provided a quote. Nothing more! Imagine my amazement when I received notification that they were now in a fixed contract with me. I have complained and they at least acknowledge that the contract was a 'mistake'. However the problem is that I had awarded the contract to ANOTHER supplier and now I am in an unwanted contract with Scottishpower who say they cannot guarantee they will 'release me' to the supplier I did want in time for that contractual commitment! I have had to make lots of phones calls, e-mails and time spent between my old supplier, the supplier I want, and Scottishpower who illegally hijacked my business. Scottishpower are quick to note they will not pay compensation for the problems they cause people and do not accept liability for their actions although they have magnanimously offered a trifling sum for all the lost time from my business. My advice is do not even call them-you could be 'accidentally' roped into a contract you don't want!
656|"A month and a half after we moved in to our new home, Scottish Power sent us an ""Estimated Final Bill"".  Who gets an estimated FINAL bill?  We had already set up an account with another provider, but Scottish Power informs us that they do not talk with other providers - not a problem I have EVER had.So coerced to pay the ""administration charge"" for passing our ""debt"" on to the debt collectors after ""having tried numerous times to contact you"" (sent us one bill).  Thieves.I got a good idea of how Scottish Power view their customers, so I will know to avoid them in future."
657|Despite numerous calls Scottish Power call handlers dont appear to be able to process simple account details.  I have been trying to set up a direct debit for my account for 2 months now - shocking service!  (Given 1 star as no stars is not an option)
658|I changed to Scottish Power in July 2009 as they offered much better value than npower at the time.  The tariffs increased, however, and once I had a notification of their latest price hikes in June I decided to change again.  I sent Scottish Power an email, explaining that I would be terminating my contract with them due to tariff increases.  Eventually I signed up with EDF Online Fixed S@ver 2 for dual fuel.I was subsequently contacted by the Scottish Power Customer Retention team.  I politely told them that I was happy with my new supplier and wouldn't change back.  The rep said he would note that.  I then received further calls from them.  I explained that it was pointless to ring me me as I had fixed with EDF and would be staying with them at least until September 2012.  The calls didn't stop so I requested my phone number to be deleted from their system.  I was told they would do that.  I still received more calls to the extend that I told them that I obviously had managed to hit them where it hurts the most!I received my final call in October.  At that point I got quite angry as I had asked them so many times to remove my details from their system.  The rep was patronising.  I then told them that I was so happy that I had found a decent supplier.  He then said 'so we're not good enough to supply you' and I said 'no, you're not'.  I then explained that I would be making a formal complaint about their telephone harrassment and would go to the regulators if needed.I subsequently made a formal complaint and finally the calls were stopped.  I settled for a nominal compensation but made it clear that I would never use them again.  With me hard sale tactic just doesn't work.  Well done Scottish Power, you've now lost a customer for life!    
659|I have a pre-paid meter and found my energy supplier (SSE) had increased my tarrif by about 50% without notification.  I did a comparison and Scottish Power came out cheapest so I signed up. That was over a month ago and nothing has happened.  I am still with my old supplier and just keep receiving the same welcome letter over and over again.  I contacted them and then I received a welcome email and some personal website account.  Still no swap over and the progress bar remains at the welcome letter stage.I keep contacting them and keep getting more welcome letters all are exactly the same.  I have tried to swap to somebody who will take on my account but I can't now my account is stuck in the switch over process.  They would be probably cheaper but seem to have absolutely no resources to carry out the account swap over as the meter will need to be programmed on site.  I think I have signed myself up into something that is going to be very complicated and time consuming to rectify so I can go with a more reputable company.
660|Capped 18 months ago on electric. Monthly did change mid contract & I was able to find out why. I decided to stick with the higher amount. Just had a refund as they spotted my over-payments were more than the amount I would need in my account to cover the Winter costs & they dropped my monthly amount. Staff pleasant & helpful.
661|I switched to Scottish Power six months ago, and throughout my time with them my account has been in credit, often considerably so.I accept prices have gone up (by an average of 19% I believe), but to receive a letter today telling me the cost of my dual fuel tariff has increased by 47%, and my monthly direct debit (based on their forecast) by a whopping 70%, has left be staggered.Particularly when you bear in mind that, by my own calculation and based on their CURRENT prices, my average consumption over the six months I have been with them has been an absolute MAXIMUM of GBP60.Something does not quite add up, and my complaint is now under investigation.
662|"Joined them under their ""Atlantic Electric"" brand only to find out it was Scottish Power. Getting mail from two different companies was confusing enough, but the Scottish Power letters looked like a poor attempt at a con with photocopied letter-heads.Over charging, double charging, applying debt onto my account from another customer, lies, and ridiculously high rates. My parents are paying less to heat a 4 bedroom house than I am with a 1 bed flat. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. "
663|"Guys watch out for dirty ScottishPower tactics, They get new customers by offering cheap rates but once you have joined then they increase your tariff rate and introduce a new cheaper version of tariffs  for ""New Customers"". So this way they are able to continue to advertise cheaper rates. If you call sales line for the first time, they answer it straight away and all very happy jappy.BUT once you have joined and have 12 months contract, they make you suffer more than anything.After 12 month ScottishPower renewed my contract without telling me and when I tried to change the supplier, they charged me GBP60. So please DO NOT USE SCOTTISHPOWER. ScottishPower is a horrible company."
664|I joined scottish power 2 years ago. Even though i phoned them countless times they failed to correctly set up a direct debit. I owed them over GBP1000. As the bill came down i tried to change to eon. They said no until i had got below GBP200 on my debt. Now i'm below GBP200 they still say now until i have paid off the debt. The amount i'm paying changes as and when the feel like changing it. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS if you really want to save money long term.
665|I switch to Scottish Power in Feb 2011 and what a mistake that was!! A monthly direct debit price was agreed an set up but after just 3 weeks it was increased from GBP55 to GBP80 without any warning or meter readings being provided!! When I rang them, the woman on the phone was rude, arrogant and evasive. I have now changed to Eon but not before being handed a GBP35 cancellation charge from Scottish Power even though this fee is not mentioned anywhere in my contract!! I would definitely avoid this incompetent, arrogant and rip-off company!
666|I switched 6 months ago to the Online tariff, which means I get a discount off the regular price and all I have to do is, once a month, go and take the meter readings and then login to the Scottish Power website and type it in.  It automatically changes my monthly charge and has some reports to show me if my gas or electricity use is going up or down compared to previously.  It's dead easy and saves me money.  Not good if you don't have an Internet connection (in which case, how are you reading this...?).  Recently had some calls from other energy companies but they could not beat the tariff I'm on, though one of them said they would be cheaper than Scottish Power by the summer.
667|I elected to use Scottish Power several years ago as they offered the best dual-fuel deal but, like many other users, found that my payments were increasing rapidly. Due to a mix-up over the Direct Debit I ended up owing them several hundred pounds, which meant I had to go pre-payment to clear the debt. Again Scottish Power screwed up, failing to set the meter to reclaim the debt, and when I tried to changer supplier I found I still owed them money for electricity.  I now use E-on for gas (they're great!) but have stayed with Scottish power for electricity, even though my debt is now clear, as they are the cheapest.  Customer service is terrible but as a prepayment user I shouldn't now need to call them anyway.
668|i have been with scottish power for nearly 2years, the bills started off great at GBP55 a month for both gas and elec then after a couple month it shot up to GBP143 a month , i think is shockin as i stay in small 2bedroom flat, i am in the process of moving companies just now. would not recommend to anyone
669|SP have recently increased our bill by GBP40 a month based on an estimated use over the next 12 months, despite our account being in credit. Cannot understand the reason for this so I decided to ring and query the increase. However, I have not been able to get through! Each time I ring I am presented with a recorded message stating the waiting time is anywhere between an hour and two hours, which is ridiculous - never before have I had wait times like this for any other call centre. So I selected to use the 'ring back' service. Two hours later the phone rang, and it was SP - a recorded message then said they would connect me. The phone rang, and then cut me off!! So I tried again, and again selected ring back. Again I was cut off! I tried this 4 times in total and each time I was cut off.   Two days later and still I have not been able to speak to anyone, each time I ring I am still given the recorded message about high waiting times. I have written an email to Customer Services to complain about the impossibility of getting to speak to someone, but I do not expect a response/  Rubbish service, cannot understand how this company operates if customers are not able to get through to speak to someone.
670|We were sold a dual energy plan which was supposed to save us a tidy sum per year. Within 8 months our plan had been changed (severing our contract) with no notification whatsoever. Our bills began to arrive which were much higher than our previous suppliers ever billed us - with no increase in our energy usage (if anything we were a little more energy concious with all the eco information about reducing). As a result of this we challenged Scottish Power claiming we'd been misled into accepting a product and, that they were in breach of their contract with us. We were passed from pillar to post getting sense from some of the representatives and, none from others. In the end Scottish Power blamed the rep who sold us the plan saying it wasn't a suitable plan for our household usage. The poor lad who sold it to us (bearing in mind they contacted us to try and SAVE US money)was reading from a standard script issued to all the reps. He was reprimanded for the company's bad procedures. With an outstanding sum into the 1000's we pressed for the ombudsman to investigate the problems we were experiencing. The ombudsman found that the company had been negligent in their selling of a product agreeing with the company that the product had been sold by the rep!! They were forced to reduce our bill by a measly GBP75.00. We explained that the bills for our energy were much higher than our previous supplier because they had swapped us to the highest tariff possible without informing us when they decided to terminate our contract we also, noticed that their statements of our usage differed greatly from the ons provided to the ombudsman. We still owe this money - we are not very well-off so can offer little on top of weekly outgoings. We have tried to negotiate with the collection agencies sent on behalf of S.P. who have initially agreed to our offer then informed us a week later saying S.P. will not agree to anything less than GBP80.00 per month. They offered us prepayment meters to help. DON'T TAKE THIS OPTION IF OFFERED!! we looked into this and, they will take what they want and, leave you penniless and, without energy. We have stuck to our guns and, explained everything to the collection agencies who have constantly badgered us -  ringing up to 10 times a day!! It is an annoying nightmare but, these people can not bully someone into paying more than they are able to. Most of the collection agencies pass back the debt as they gather blood can't be drawn from a stone. One wonderful door collector (from SCOTCALL) accepted our offer and, has always been polite and, accommodating. Again, not good enough for S.P. so they stopped him collecting and, passed the debt to another agency. We keep asking ' If we are so in the wrong why don't you take us to court so that we can have a fair hearing?' Well we know that will not happen because, the magistrate may find some interest in the fact that our offer to pay was refused by S.P. This is another breach this time a breach of the law. OUR MESSAGE TO YOU ALL - DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY. THEY WILL TAKE YOU TO HELL AND BACK AND CHARGE YOU DOUBLE USING THEIR STAFF AS SCAPEGOATS. YOU WILL BE TREATED AS IF YOU HAVE NO INTELLIGENCE AND BAMBOOZLE YOU WITH FIGURES. THEY WILL ONLY WORK WITH YOU IF YOU AGREE TO HAND OVER ALL YOU HAVE AND WILL NOT THINK TWICE IF IT PUTS YOUR HEALTH AT RISK. THIS IS THE REAL CONTRACT THEY OFFER.  Netia & family
671|I've been with Scottish Power for around 2 years now and have just completed a switch to another supplier. All started out well and good - better prices than anyone else. Then the increases started. Slight, at first, then to the point I was paying GBP50 a MONTH more than promised when I signed up. Upon deciding to leave, despite being in credit by a reasonable sum, Scottish Power then decided I owed them GBP186 for electricity and a further GBP86 for gas - when I queried this they couldn't actually explain how they'd come up with that amount (especially as up until that point I had paid bills on Actual readings, not Estimated, and always been in credit, so up to date with payments)but that nonetheless, if I didn't pay it they would take action. I ended up paying for a product I hadn't used, by their own admission they couldn't explain why the final bills were so high.  All well and good people saying as the consumer you have to take the initiative and change things, but you can take a horse to water.... ring a bell? You can try and complain to Scottish Power. You can talk til you're blue in the face, fact is they will change nothing and not accommodate what you're saying to them or even entertain the idea they may be wrong.  I notice the good reviews are mainly from new customers - see how you feel further down the line when all the nice promises wear off, or you dare decide you want to move suppliers. They don't like that much ;)
672|Fantastic customer service, only one or two minute waiting times on calls and an easy, quick online meter reading facility which gives you instant up to date bills. You can also change your monthly payment online if it needs adjusting. Top service from Scottish Power! I've been with them for 4 years and recently switched to EDF - My biggest mistake ever as EDF are terrible! I am now returning to Scottish Power!
673|Changed to Scottish Power as they were the best priced on comparison website.  Smooth, seamless transfer - got emails throughout the process telling me what was happening.  Website is great and easy to understand.  Entered my own opening readings on-line and everything smooth.  Don't understand some of the other complaining comments against this company.  The power to resolve or force resolution is with the consumer - so no-one to blame but yourself if it goes wrong with any utility supplier.  Reads are too high - enter your own readings on-line.  Direct Debit continues to be taken after account transferred - cancel the DD you fool!!!  Not really rocket science.
674|Scottish power is pants, they are nothing but a money grabbing scheming business, I changed my supplier over to them and REGRET my move. Fair enough my pay by meter was in debt by 15 pound as i just moved in and it took a while for them to come and change my meter, every time I topped my meter key up..... when I inserted it into the meter every time they took GBP3.50 for every 5 pound I topped up, I payed off my debt but they continued to take money every time i topped up. There customer service is also ridiculous I phoned up scottish power and got told by a computer that I would wait in between 6 and 10 minutes not a minute later which was a complete lie, I eventually got through and got connected to the most snobby cocky women I have ever spoke to and after all that she told me there's nothing she can do after I explained my reasons for calling. The woman I got directed to had no manors what so ever and spoke to me in a tone as if she had some sort of authority, DO NOT REGISTER WITH THIS SO CALLED MONEY SAVING ENERGY SUPPLIER THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT..... Thank you and goodnight.............
675|I recently changed suppliers from Scottish Power after being with them for a couple of years as I found a better deal. I initiated the transfer on 25th August. I finally had a completion date of 13th October. Ok 7 weeks rather than the the 4- 6 it is supposed to take, but hey-ho things were getting sorted.   Anyway it is now 9th November, 4 weeks later and I am still waiting for my account with them to be finalised. I am owed around GBP270 that had built up in my account, something that they seem to like to do, reading other posts on the internet. A repayment cheque was apparently generated on 27th October and 'should be with me in 10-14 days'. It is now the 9th and it hasn't arrived. It seems SP are unable to generate BACS transfers despite me paying them monthly by direct debit for some unapparent reason. When I asked why it takes so long for a cheque to get to me, apparently 'its the second class postal service'! Even royal mail on their website reckon it should only take 3 days max!   The larger cheque for around GBP230 wasn't even generated until 4th November when I rang up to complain about them taking further direct debits out of my account. I guess if I hadn't rung then they would have waited until I had done before noticing anything.  I have read numerous similar tales across the internet of SP hanging on to customers money. I have already insisted that they are paying me interest (GBP10 so far) and that I will send them my telephone bill. I had thought I might go back to SP at some point as they seemed fine while we were with them but not now!   We also received numerous phonecalls for a couple of weeks when we were in the process of transferring trying to convince us to stay. They were an utter nuisance and I would encourage anyone to avoid them like the plague.
676|I call for re-training the staff on how to give 'good' customer service, excellent would be asking too much. I spoke to two people on the same day to try and get some information regarding my account. They were very unhelpful, dismissive, rude and patronising. I would never recommend Scottish Power to anyone. 
677|"Had been with SP for about 2 years on an on line fixed price tariff. No problems. Then did a comparison review. Found cheapest supplier was .... SP. But they refused to move me to this tariff as it was ""only for new customers"". So decided to switch to next cheapest and save over GBP100, get GBP55 cashback and a free energy monitor (EON). From that point SP's customer service deteriorated e.g. phoned me asking me to stay and while I was explaining why I was going put the phone down on me. Did other things too that were unnecessary and, franly, petty. I won't be rushing back to them.  "
678|Currently, and for some time Scottish Power have been unable to supply detailed bills to online customers - only the amount to be billed. In my case this is for a variable quarterly direct debit. I recently added gas to my electricity account and after some hassle I had a bill sent by e-mail.   It was indecipherable - VAT and discounts were not separated between gas and electricity amongst other details. DO NOT USE THE FOR DUAL FUEL!   I will shortly be leaving them.
679|"I have found Scottish Power to be a complete pain in the a*! They are completely unhelpful and a hysterical company, I wish I had never switched to them in the first place. I was happy with the company I was with before, but all their talk of savings took me in, and they tied me into a contract. In future I will claim to be tied into a contract to avoid talking to sales people! They messed up my direct debit, I don't know what they did, I've never had problems before but they claimed it couldn't be set up to my account (despite me having about 10 other dd's set up???) Anyway, they didn't communicate this error to me and began immediately sending me letters, threatening court action etc. because I ""hadn't paid"" despite not telling me that the dd hadn't been set up and not sending me any bills!!! They have been the same since, they send a bill saying if I pay in 10 days I will get a discount, yet before the ten days are up (usually 2/3 days later) I get the next letter saying they'll take legal action against me, and if I fail to respond immediately to this letter, which I did whilst on a 10 day holiday, within another 2/3 days they pass it on to their other dept which pretends to be a separate debt company!!! It is outrageous, I am complaining to them and to whoever regulates them when I find out. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!"
680|After being in credit for over a year, even after the coldest winter, I get letters telling me they are INCREASING my monthly payments and I have to phone and argue about it yet again! I get told over the phone that THEY decide how much I pay and I have no say in it! They do not listen, do not care and their estimated readings are invariably too high. AVOID SCOTTISH POWER!!
681|I have Gone Through The Website pcmswitch.co.uk..It is a very imformative portal..which is effective for the Electricity Customers in UK.  The Significance of the Site is restored in itself..As It provides information about ENERGY SAVING TIPS as well as BEST ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER IN UK.
682|I am with EBICO, which is really cheap but they outsource their customer services to Southern Electric, which is part of Scottish and Southern Energy Group and customer services at Southern electric are absolutely atrocious. The savings made with EBICO are offset by the worst customer service you can possibly imagine. Before I made my purchase I would have liked to know how rubbish Southern Electric are, it also wasn't clear EBICO use Southern Electric for their customer Services. 
683|"I just want to remind people NEVER to buy from Gas and electricity companies from their sales people over the phone they will blatantly lie through their teeth to get you to sign with them!   I've had a fella from scottish power on the phone the last 2 days telling me that they have a cheaper tariff for me than my current provider EON, who I have only been with for 2 months so I was not quite beliving him from the start. So I said I would check it out first so he agreed to phone me back. I went on a comparison site and my current tarriff was still the cheapest and the scottish power cheapest tariff for me was GBP255 more expensive than my current one. So I was ready for him for when he phoned back!   He phoned today and tried to baffle me with BS and the hard sell that their rates were a lot cheaper etc. I told him that they were'nt and that because of the massive 20% discount EON give me that they work out a lot cheaper. Then he starts to tell me that ""well no"" and that they have a new online energy saver 8 out and it is not on comparison websites yet so you can't really trust what the website says blah blah blah to be honest I never made a note of the scottish power deal at the time but I told him No but for a few seconds I honestly beleived him and if it was for earlier lies that I had been told from N power in the past I might well have signed up.   But I have just gone on the price comparison site and low and behold the energy saver 8 is the one I was looking at GBP255 more expensive than my current. So just a not DO NOT trust them and always check it out before you sign up rant over now . Thanks Rob   "
684|Scottish Power have seriously lost the plot. I have moved to Southern Electric and Scottish power have conveniently not closed my account and still taking monthly direct debits.  I am livid.  Scottish Power made out it was Southern Electrics fault which it is not as Southern Electric have issued the meter readings already to them.  Southern Electric have even paid my bank charges of GBP20 for the overdraft thanks to POXY SCOTTHIS POWER. I hope they all rot and the fat pigs earning all the bonuses have heart failures from being so fat from all the money they make. WILL NEVER EVER USE THEM AGAIN AND NEVER RECOMMEND ANY ONE TO USE THEM EITHER, all hunky dory every month until you realize you can save money and want to move..
685|Who are these idiots. I have just had baliffs turn up at my address regarding unpaid bills for a meter unconnected to my home! I've repeatedly told them that this was the case yet their customer services failed to correct the issue 12 times over 4 months! They are beyond useless. Im glad im with another provider for my actual utilities!
686|Don't choose Pay in Advance Scottish Power offered their pay in advance option to me a few weeks after i decided to switch my second supplier to their dual fuel offer. Unfortunately for me, their system was not updated so they kept debiting money from my account for the second supply. After calling them to ask why i was still being debited, i had to make another payment of GBP600 to switch my second supply to pay in advance as well. I then lost access to their online system for months, with no bills in paper or electronic forms. They also continued direct debiting me for 3 months after the 2 payments of GBP600. I also sent 3 emails to their online support over 3 months with no result. Also, I have now been informed that as a pay in advance customer, i am no longer entitled to an online billing discount.
687|they changed my contract from 60 ponds a month to 300 pounds a month, and when i found thaat it is much ore than my usage, i asked them to change thee price, but i was told, they cannot change it know.  the over estimate your usage, and you will have to call again and again to take some of your rights. 
688|I had an online account with Scottish Power for over a year.  During that time I kept a tight watch on my energy consumption and submitted meter readings promptly. My monthly direct debit payments tallied exactly with my annual useage and took into account seasonal fluctuations. However, they kept writing to advise my direct debit was due to be increased. Each time I had to call customer services and talk them through my account history to show that there was no need.  Each time they agreed but, in August, my direct debit was increased in spite of the fact I was in credit and had received assurances that my direct debit would remain the same.  It is bang out of order for a company to 'dip into' my bank account when it feels like it. No excuses, it's BAD PRACTICE. As a direct result, I switched to Southern Electric today.  Their tarrif is a little more expensive but they offer a GBP40 bonus for signing up before 18th(?) October which will cancel out the minor increase to my annual bills.
689|I have recently had my 1st dealing with Scottish Power. They estimated my start reading & ignored my actual readings. I kept complaining & then had to use Energy Watch & threaten them. It still took several months to sort & the removal of my metre on my request which confirmed reading was the only way I got through to them. It caused considerable stress + numerious phone calls. They used debt collection that harrased me at home & work. I changed suppliers straight away & the GBP295 bill for 3 weeks was reduced to just a few pounds they were not interested paid no compensation & there specialist complaints team were condasending & a waste of space. As a landlord I will now not permit Scottish Power in any of my properties. 0 out of 10
690|Ive been billed by scottish power for a meter thats not even mine,so we phoned them and they said an engineer will be round to sort the problem out AND IN THE MEAN TIME THE BILL IS FROZEN. That was in june and now its august and still no one has came round and the bills still keep coming.WARNING TO ANYONE WHO IS THINKING ABOUT USING SCOTTISH POWER THINK TWICE.   
691|"Scottish power are uncaring, untruthful and their customer service reps can be very patronising. When left without electricity for a couple of days and i explained i was disabled & cooked on electricity plus needed to eat to take essential meds, i was asked if i shouldn't be in a home for ""people like me"" rather than living alone in my home. I was accused of meter tampering then sent a key that was not coded for the new meter rendering me without electricity again. I explained i could not use the key I had credited & was instructed to take down details, go to a paypoint & get the key updated (which erased the credit i had put on). When i asked what about the credit i had put on i was basically called a liar (How do i know you really did put credit on it?) even though i offered to give the receipt date, place & time. NIGHTMARE....STEER CLEAR OF THEM!!!"
692|Don't use Scottish power,they tried to get me to pay a very high final gas bill when I changed suppliers, was told that my bill would be placed on hold until my new suppliers had sorted out the meter readings as the bill was inadequate, in the mean time was sent a court summons for not paying the bill and phone calls from Scottish power demanding I settle the payment over the phone. 
693|Scottish power are a joke. Basically they have been trying to charge me for someone elses electricity! i live in an apartment and all the meter boxes for the apartments are all situated together. within the first month of moving in they sent me my first bill for  GBP250 for one months worth of electricity considering i live alone and am not in throughout the day i highly doubt i could use this much. on countless occasions i contacted them with the correct meter reading from the date i moved in, 10 or so phone calls later and a letter from the debt collectors i spoke to a women who had no customer communication skills and told me i had been taking the wrong meter readings and she told me to turn the main power off from the box i was reading and only to call back if i had been reading the wrong one. when i asked if i should contact them if i was correct (which i was) she said no! i called back anyway with the serial number from the correct meter box to find, like i had been saying since day one that they were taking my neighbours reading and they admitted this. basically 7 months later and still no apology i'v got debt collectors contacting me weekly telling me to pay a bill which is not mine and scottish power are doing nothing about it. everytime i contact them they say british gas needs to send them the meter readings, when i contact british gas they say they have done this??? i would never ever reckonmend scottish power to anyone!
694|Avoid scottish power like the plague unless you like paying silly prices for rubbish service.
695|I have been with Scottish Power for around 7 years and have always found them to be helpful and a competitive supplier.  I actually called them tonight, the phone was answered promptly and my query about the new Fix for Free deal they are offering me when my current offer comes to an end was answered efficiently in fact the chap who I spoke to couldn't help me enough.  Meter readings are always actual readings as well so I know exactly how much everything is costing.
696|I was a customer with Scottish Power for a little over a year. In this time, they overcharged me by hundreds of pounds. When I was canceling my service with them due to a house move, I did as I was to do and called to inform them. The woman I spoke with gave me a total and said that would be my final bill. I then received a bill for a much larger amount, called back and spoke with someone else and they had then told me my bill was incorrect, that I am to pay 300 pounds for 1 week of service that I was not even living at that address anymore. I called again, the person told me that it was the original amount, she will put a huge note on my account saying that I was incorrectly charged, to amend my bill back to the original quoted amount. I then called to have it amended (The bill at this point was a completely different amount then any I had been given thus prior) and they told me that it is more then the original amount, not 300 but 200. Still, absurd. I then got that final bill, called back AGAIN and spoke with ANOTHER person, told them to read my notes as I am very irritated I have had to call so many times. And at this point, they said its only about 70 pound more, and THAT is my total; I will receive a final bill again. So instead of my final bill, I get a COLLECTIONS LETTER. The collections letter was for the 200 pound more not even the amended amount. So once again I call back, and I ask to speak only to a supervisor; I am tired of being messed around and who can blame me after that experience? So do I get a supervisor? Nope. I got complaints. They refused to transfer me to a supervisor. And complaints once again I felt evaded every question of how my bill is incorrect, just tried to justify the total through a jumble of different fluctuations that my bill had previously been. I once again had to even tell her to read the notations on my account, which she just shunned off as if it didn't matter. I felt she offered no help, no sympathy for the apparent lack of competence their staff has and what I have had to go through. Just simply said my final bill is on its way, still being 70 pound more then originally told. I am outraged and very disgusted with this company, I will NEVER go through them again. Their customer service is so poor, and their lack of the knowledge needed to do their job properly is even more poor.
697|I would recommend Scottish Power to anyone as it is good value
698|I am hoping to stay with Scottish power as they are excellent value and once November comes up will do a comparison check accordingly.  Still looking into Solar power tho I warn all firms this is the next revolutionary step to save money!
699|I found this is a poor utility provider with one of the highest rates in the market. When I first moved into a new house in February, they charged me for an extra half of January using their estimate, and at the same time, they also charged the previous tenants for that half of the month. Luckily, that guy was a friend of mine. When I called them, they still thought that they were right. After a while (I mean after several phone calls here and there), they apologised and then finally deducted the amount. Also, I find that their internet account tended to be prone to problems - I often get the internet interface saying 'sorry, there is a problem'. This was first time with Scottish power. Later I filed for a switch to a different provider and guess what, the switch application was cancelled by Scottish Power because they said we owed them, despite already cleared the balance beforehand. When I called them up, they apologised for the mistake, and now I have to wait for another 28 days for the switch over to take place. So meanwhile, I still have to pay to Scottish Power. Plus they have one of the highest rate in the market. If you can, steer away from Scottish Power. There are far better service providers than Scottish Power. Go to uswitch, and you see for yourself what you could save. Hope these comments help.
700|We have lots of troubles with Scottish Power. They keep sending us incorrect bills. We have been with other company for nearly half year, but Scottish Power still keeps sending us the wrong bills which is not our account at all. We keep informing them about the wrong account, but till now they are still sending us the wrong account bills.  
701|"Scottish power has lost our prepayment meter payments! They call them ""misdirected payments"" as if you are somehow to blame, when really it's them.They have ""tried"" to find these payment on my behalf - as if they are doing me any favours - but this takes about 8 weeks. What did they conclude? Yes, that they must be ""misdirected""!We got a letter this morning saying that they are raising our tarriff to pay the amount we owe. I thought the word ""prepayment"" means pay before you use!My advice to anybody considering Scottish Power is, simply, don't!"
702|In general I am one of the lucky few who are happy with Scottish Power. My main niggle is that as a customer you have to be vigilant with your direct debits. As an example, my payment was lowered by 20% shortly before Christmas (2007/8) as I was using less gas/electricity than expected. Two months later, my payment was increased to reflect the recent round of price rises. No problem there, as this was expected. What wasn't expected was that instead of raising my new payment by 15%, I received a very unclear Email which suggested that my direct debit was about to be increased by 300%. The onus was on me to challenge this and prove my low consumption. However, Scottish Power did respond to my Emails in good time and the matter was quickly resolved (if never explained). I then received 2 letters on the same day with different direct debit amounts enclosed. The less vigilant, elderly, or just plain too busy could easily fall foul of mistakes In short, as long as you keep tabs on things, Scottish Power are as good as any other.
703|You end up phoning them up to give them the same information 6, 7, 8 times..? (I lost count). They cannot communicate with each other, so information was never passed on, or it seems, recorded. When you agree a date for them to come and change the meter, Scottish Power get the date wrong and then wonder why you are not in to receive them.
704|When you first join, Scottish Power sound caring, but after a few months with them, I was kept on hold for around 15 minutes on a premium call rate to Scotland. If one payment is late for any reason you are sent a final warning of contract commitment.The cost of usage fuel per annum is far too high, and they don't take into consideration that in the summer you use less fuel, so the payments are too expensive. The call centre is always busy, and they have never kept to their appointments.
705|We recently moved premises with our business and Scottish Power supplied the landlord. Within days of moving in we received a hard sales call. They didn't care who they spoke to as long as the person at this end indicated that they could enter a contract for services, and pushed a three year contract on us. Apparently they can hold you to a verbal contract (which can be entered into by anyone it seems), and there's nothing you can do about it. So beware. When you ring them you'll be stuck in a call queue for ages - 30 minutes is my average. Awful company. Pay more if necessary - just go somewhere else for your electricity.
706|Twelve months after applying for a Scottish Power supply, my account is a complete shambles. They have messed up far more than I can list here. But it includes getting day/night meter readings round the wrong way, up to 3-fold overestimate on estimated gas/electric bill, unexplained random GBP100 charge on the account. Also they don't respond to e-mails within their 5 day target, or sometimes at all.
707|After 9 months I have recieved no account number, no bills or statements and no webaccess.  Direct debits have been changed without notificaion and no attempt made to rectify the problem. Response to my e-mails has been sporadic. No point phoning. You just wait forever.
708|To cut a long story short, Scottish Power keep sending bills to me based on incorrect meter readings. Once they agree they have got it wrong, they send a correct bill. However, the following quarter, I am back to square one and the whole tedious palaver begins again. My parents have also had problems with Scottish Power.Avoid like the plague. Consider burning your own excrement for fuel before signing up with them.
709|they bill you estimated when you give them the read they dont bleave you,so they can bill you higher,they ring with somany different numbers harrass u anytime of the evening demands payment NOW! avoid this corrupt ripping of company to trading/ombuds and terminate contract soon as.
710|Please everybody stay away from this company.i had one of the opus energy guys come to our house and fooled my wife to sing a 3 yrs contrac and we got screwed.the bills were so high it nearly bankrupt our company and we couldn't do anything about it till the end of our contract and the bills were going up every month,we were paying like GBP600 a month now we moved with EON and omg the bills went down by 50%,I beg you stay away from them.
711|I have no idea how this company are still allowed to bully, threaten and blackmail customers into agreeing contracts with them. Illegal practices and it seems they have nobody to answer too. The staff working for them haven't got a clue. There appears to be many departments who do not communicate with each other, the workers who don't communicate and who are all on commission. The sooner this disgrace of a company is shut down the better. Make sure you take your own readings of the meter as they like to estimate your bill. If you're on fixed term contract ask for when your notice period is to end your fixed term contract and when exactly you need to tell them you want to switch or cancel. Request and respond to this in email so there's written evidence and a trail that you want to cancel or switch. Have a look on OFGEM.gov website (regulators of gas and electricity) - it says on there:- 'If your current supplier does object to your switch, they are under licence obligations to tell you this as soon as possible. They must also tell you: the reason why they have objected how you can resolve this if you think you have a case' We are still fighting this disgrace of a company. ABSOLUTELY AVOID at all costs! DO NOT join this bogus company!!
712|An OPUS representative came to our shop and wanted us to join OPUS and said that they their electricity prices are cheap compared to others and so on. We agreed to join them. The guy who came to the shop said that he would need bank details and signature (He had to papers with him. First paper was the contract which needed to be signed and the second paper was with the direct debit instructions which also needed a signature.) We signed the first paper with the contract however, we told that young man that we do not want to set up direct debit and want to pay the bills by cash, to which he replied that this would be fine. We did not sign the direct debit instructions paper, nor did we provide any bank details. The young man left his phone number, in case we had any enquiries and said we will receive welcome letters through the post. What that young man did is that he wrote down some bank details himself, after he left the shop (wrong bank details) and copied my signature on the direct debit instructions paper. We tried to call that man first but he never answered the phone. After contacting OPUS they said that both pages where signed by us, which was not true. We have not been happy with OPUS for even a second! Their bills are extremely high and completely wrong and we reported another complaint regarding the meter. The meter does not work correctly. Day and night meter work together during the day and night. It has been OVER 1 YEAR now and the issue still has not been solved completely!! The only thing they do is call us and say that there is an outstanding amount that we owe them, if we dont pay it they will disconnect the electricity. They always threat us with this! IT IS THE WORST COMPANY EVER. I WOULD NOT EVEN IN MY DREAM RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE!! 
713|Hi, just like everyone we got tricked into a contract with Opus Energy, and wanted to know if anyone has managed to get out or won a case against them. 
714|my broker gave me three suppliers to choose from when my current scottish power contract ended. i was given british gas, opus energy and sse as cheaper options. i came on here to review each one and found them all to have rubbish reviews! so i decided to just go for the cheapest which was opus energy thinking that if i was going to have a bad service then i might aswell get cheaper electricity. up to now everything has been fine, my broker arranged the switch and my bills have been consistent for the last 2 months. if anything changes i will let you all know! 
715|Constantly billing me incorrect, caused me a whole lot of stress trying to run my business, my bills are being disputed and now just received a letter from the debt collectors, Abbots Debt Recovery,worst Company ever,trying to get out of the contract that I so called signed..don't recommend them.
716|Just got my renewal quote they're charging me 28p standing charge and 18p per KWh as opposed to EDF who have quoted me 23p standing charge and 10.4p per KWh. Just asked what my charges will be out of contract. Kept being told they don't know and in the end they gave me a rate of 85p per day standing charge and 22.75p per KWh. What a complete rip off. I've paid them more than GBP600 in extra charges. Struggle to believe how they can be so unethical and the attitude of the staff is atrocious.STAY AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN FROM OPUS ENERGY!!!
717|I have been paying GBP700 per month on average where after 6 months they billed me for GBP3000 and were unable to justify why this was. After 9 months of trying to resolve the situation, it finally got sorted out and I was in the right, obviously. they have now lured me into a new contract illegally without my consent and threaten to charge me extortion rates if i were not to pursue with their contract that has been given to me without my knowledge. They do not deal with any queries up until payment is due, where they keep harassing you over 10 times a day. the worst energy supplier company EVER! 
718|September last year my company Aesthetic Services spoke to an agent at Opus Energy. And was quoted 14.1 p perkw hr or 15.1p perkw hr for electricity if not having direct debit. I explained I was not paying direct debit and only willing to accept 14.1 p perkw hr on non direct debit terms. He went away came back and agreed my terms. A week later I got a contract through the post saying 14.1p per kw hr which was as agreed. Two weeks later a bill arrives at 15.1 p perkw hr. I complained to customer services who agreed to honour my 14.1pkw hr as contractually agreed. Since then I have had demands through at 15.1p perkw hr, I raised a complaint and got my 14.1p perkw hr reinstated. Today three month later I get a demand through for GBP12.41 after all of my bills had since been paid at 14.1 p perkw hr!!!!! The agent is useless and puts me through to customer services. The customer services agent says yes we have applied back rate at 15.1p per kw hr. I explain in frustration its been agreed several times im clearly on 14.1p perkw hr. He smugly says we listened to the recorded conversation in December and you say the extra 7% for not having direct debit wasnt explained to you. I explained that was taken out of context and yes it was explained but i refused it and he clearly came back to me with the agreed 14.1p , and I pointed out I was correct as per my contract in writing. This man was hanging on the fact I said it hadnt been explained , but didnt come forward with the rest of the conversation that would show the agent agreed my terms after in the same call. I pushed the call will explain that. He rudely said it was september last year and how can you remember!!!! Upset I explained since that recording you have honoured my contract on several phone calls. he wouldnt budge until I asked for his complaints procedure. Now im waiting for another email from him to say yes your on 14.1p perkw hr as originally agreed. The lenghts he went to to conceil the rest of the telephone conversation has left me with no trust in Opus energy, be aware even when they are wrong they will try and trip you up or question if you can remember 6 months ago. 
719|This company is atrocious my electric went from GBP60 odd a month to over GBP300 a month for no reason apart from they keep estimating my bill. Which I don't understand as I keep sending them metre readings as they never seem to relieve them. But they are more than happy to harass you for a payment 3 times a day. Never use this company they are terrible and just raise your bill after 3 months. Has ruined my business as it's only a year old and seem to pay opus with most my takings every month do a bill I believe isn't correct. Hate hate hate them
720|for 2 years I have been fighting this corrupt company. they lied about who they were as they claimed to be utility warehouse, I had to call police as they rang over 100 times and were swearing at me and aggressive. iv fought and fought them, they don't have my correct details, they illegally got hold of my landlords details and billed him and harassed him for the money. they refuse to sort it out and how on earth they are still operating is beyond me! OFGEM CLOSE THEM DOWN! please stop this company ruining any more lives. they have illegally turned off my supply so my business is not able to earn money. I have 2 kids under 7 with another on the way, staff wages to pay, I don't know what to do! im basically bankrupt because of them! they turned up unannounced, turned off the electric and charged GBP2k to disconnect and further GBP400 to connect which I cannot afford so looks like my life is finished! someone please help shut this company down!
721|This company as closed my business in 4 months of supplying us they are a sham I told em I was struggling and I would pay just needed a little leeway but they came and disconnected us over 200 pound debt which was to high anyhow the staff are ignorarant they should be closed down I'm getting on to the government about these any feedback by people would be great more support the better let's close this corrupt firm down 
722|Fraudulent Sales tactics. Dangerous Company.
723|They have dodgey agents who are from Abroad and can't speak proper English. They also trick u into contracts it's like they can't afford decent people. They are inexperienced. I am very surprised they even have 1.2 stars, some one must be drunk when they gave them these stars to them. It could be someone from opus energy who gave it to them. I wouldn't RECOMMEND them to anyone not even my enemies if I had any. Their are many other good companies which are a lot better and have better agents. If I could I would give them minus five stars. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm the only customers. I was tricked into it. I hope this feedback helps when ur choosing a energy supplier.
724|Tried to change the direct debit but forms were not actioned. Old account closed and Opus wrote that we had breached contract and would be charged admin fee and higher unit rate. I complained to customer service and everything was sorted out very quickly, no charges levied and returned to correct tariff. Proof of a successful company is not when things go right but how they handle things when they go wrong. Opus acted immediately and resolved my complaint entirely. Having dealt with the larger energy providers on numerous occasions, I am happy to recommend this organisation  
725|Since the rates are not that expensive, I thought of hiring them after a long telephone discussion. Actually, they promised me lot more than what other companies usually do. Despite the promises, the service was utter rubbish!
726|I signed up with this company late last year when moving into a small shop. I arranged a 1 year deal over the phone a letter comes through saying i had agreed a 3 year deal. Then they completely mix my shop up with another shop and send me their bills, when that has been sorted they send me my first bill which is 3 times higher than i was paying for a larger shop.Requested they do not phone me during the day as i have customers and they phone during the day from completely different numbers. This company seriously needs to be looked into and in my opinion shut down.
727|very pool services all agency and sale customer detail to third part agency. always rubbish . and double price give to us . DO NOT ORDER ANY SERVICES 
728|plz do not go too rthe opues very bad serverse over serging bill every month i really dont know what too do
729|High pressure sales to get you, no way to get out as distance selling rules don't apply to business. Continuous harassment following bills that are over due by a few days. rude staff, very expensive bills 
730|I had the exactly the same experience with yours. And they claim that I have sign and verbal contract with them. No matter how much time i spend with them to clarify that I don't want the contract.
731|We've been with them for 18 months now and just renewed for a third year. Really pleased with the price we were offered and any issues have been speedily dealt with. No queues on the phone and we had a free smart meter fitted. I can only speak as I find and I'd have no problem recommending them.
732|"I've recently started a new business, upon doing so I got a call from some one claiming to be from ""XX"" (the previous tenants energy company). I'm not sure how they found out so quickly I moved into this property or which supplier the previous tenant was with. This person then proceeded to ask me some information about the business. Then before asking me if I wanted to stay in a contract with ""XX"", he went and said ""Oh, under new government law we are required to give you the prices for the top five cheapest energy company"". He then proceeded to list 5 Energy company as following: Example 1: standing unit 47p per day & 23 kWh. Example 2, 3, 4, with similar charges. And finally, OPUS Energy, the winner. With the rates of.. say what?! 27p standing unit per day & 13.20p. And well ofc after given those prices I wanted to leave ""XX"" and move to Opus Energy. I gave them my bank details etc. Following this, I kept getting calls from this number (the ""XX company"") and another number similar to this. (FYI, I later found out this is the number of an independent broker company through confirming this with Opus Energy). ""Opus Energy"" then called and said I failed credit check (a lie) and that I had to fax them the lease and blablabla. About this call and the many others (From all, that I assume is from the same broker company): 1. Called me out of ""office hours"" 2. Not the number listed on the REAL XX website 3. The same guy from ""XX"" accidently called me (from the same number at one point too) claiming he is OpusEnergy, I recognise his annoying pushy whiney tone. 4. Told me I can't stay with my current supplier cause they're going to DEENERGISE ME. I found out what an independent broker is after calling the real XX and telling her my story. She explained to me what it sounds like has happened and the best thing to do was to just enter a contract with them so they can't hand me over. Well, both these company's failed in their own way, but the biggest failure and noob is myself for being so naive and careless. The real XX company failed to keep me with them and now I am with Opus Energy.. I think. I've received letters both company saying I'm in a contract with them. It's a Saturday so I can't even confirm anything with XX until Monday. OPUS energy said I'm with them so who knows. I have anxiety, this whole situation has made me worry non stop for the past 2 weeks. I will be reposting this on the review centre and many others to warn others. Honestly, the rates of Opus Energy isn't that ""bad"" compared to the real price of the XX company. Still, it will add up and I will be at lost. I just hate being deceived and feeling like I've been conned. As well as all this unecessary stress! So, I hope Karma gets you indecent broker people and Opus Energy. Would you please stop using this sly manipulative tactic to gain more customers, and causing more problems for small businesses like myself. Your company has a rating of 1.2/5 stars. Pretty sure that's because you can't rate it 0 stars otherwise it'd be 0.2/5. Anyone here able to give me some advice or have similar stories?"
733|I thought I'd leave a review after panicking myself sick.  I signed up with Opus with an agent over the phone then reviewed the company afterwards.  I obviously started to worry because of all the bad reviews.  I am now on my third month with Opus with no problems at all.  I have had a free smart meter installed and get monthly bills. Up to now fingers crossed no problems apart from the first sleepless night after reading bad reviews
734|poor service poor marketing skills spent approx 50 pounds in phone callsto sort out direct debit issues they took over 1000 pound in direct debit for gas not used and sent baliff action for approx 200 oustanding electric when id already paided 800  my contract already cancelled and its not up till may the worst company possible should be called hopeless energy
735|They prentended that they are my current supplier .and push me to sign within 10mins.ortherwise they would cut off my electricity supply.and need 1500 to restart if I fail to sign a contact immediately .wow.what a horrible company!i should call police for this disgusting company !
736|Don't normally succumb to reviewing online but felt the need to WARN about this company.  Where do I start? Well, they locked us into a 3 year contract when we only agreed over the phone to 1 - no exit allowed at all (according to the operator!)  Then on our FIRST BILL (which we disputed as they took the crossover meter-reading incorrectly), we authorized a GBP20 'gesture' payment until the meter issue was solved.....THEY TOOK THE REMAINING BALANCE TOTAL AND LEFT GBP20 TO PAY!!!!!! Would not refund as they said they've looked into the reading and it's within the allowed tolerances - 'that's the end of it - case closed' I was told.We're in the process of seeking legal advice on them as they're, obviously, not fit for purpose.Absolute MUPPETS - the lot of them.  Couldn't communicate a message efficiently if they were making an enquiry at a convention for semaphore, morse, lighthouse & smoke signal enthusiasts!
737|"I have a business and these seemed to come out the cheapest on set up so I took my electricity from then. The 1st mths bill in a small garage was GBP260 so I refused to pay and I gave meter reading over the following week to get a proper bill which ended at GBP160 still way too high. As I then had outstanding payment to make I asked to pay it off with my normal bill over 3 mths but they said ""not possible"". Since then I have made payments by phone but seem to not be reducing my bill, so before making last payment I requested they send the bill by post after they called me 5x a day, emailed, sent threatening letters etc. Since telling the lady to send this I have been further harassed by these idiots, getting 3 - 5 calls a day and the guy I just hung up on actually told me ""sir this isn't harassment"" apologies nothing. I will leave these idiots asap, bullies that need to learn Customer service!!"
738|Thank God I read these reviews. I may just be in time to stop the process. I know better than to be sold something over the phone but they let me believe they were from my current supplier. There should be regulations in place to stop these people. I seem to be attracting the wrong people this year. If something is cheap then there's a catch. 
739|This company wants to be closed down they call you from different phone numbers never get electric from these people these are a nasty company avoid avoid 
740|Avoid from this ridiculous company. When moving into a new business, got numerous phone calls from cold callers asking me I am on an emergency rate and I need to switch urgently to opus energy as they are the cheapest in the area.( That was rubbish talking) They charge you for more than even you could think of. I don't understand why these people work for opus when they know it is a hopeless, dodgy, dishonest, liar and crappy company. AVOID,AVOID,AVOID,AVOID,AVOID
741|Poor customer service.Extortionate ratesWatch out for the fine printWill stab you in the backEven if it looks like a good deal there are so many hidden chargesEmployees the worst debt collectorsIt's not a service it's extortion
742|i was duped  into a contract  till 2016 highest bills ever i have tried to set up a payment plan to pay this ridiculous bill offering GBP50 a wk as thats all i can afford to pay as a new business and they  point blanked refused i dont no what to do ive tried to explain plz try and let me pay this instead of nothing to clear it and they wont have any of it  they call me all hours of the day and send texts they are very aggressive and unwilling to help or resolve the problem they threaten to cut me off i really dont no what to do as its really getting me down and causing me to be depressed worrying if they are going to ruin my business as a single mum and only being open 5 months its already very stressful  and the longer the longer this carries on the bigger my bill gets 
743|This company use under hand tactics.....beware when you get cold calls advising they are from british gas or other leading companies....this company tricks you into long term contracts at ridiculous rates...stickto main stream suppliers to avoid the hassle....their credit department is trained as a bunch of bullies...its almost like receiving death threats....theyre salea department dont know what they are talling about and use rigourous tactics....if you have meter problems....they will never get resolved...they have several dodgy brokers...all in all a disgraceful company.....oh and beware of their renewal rates.....they are charged at double at normal cost price....i do hope opus energy do get exposed as they have put many small companies out of business...if you have been tricked into joining this company...please keep esculating your complaint to the senior management and the ombudsman....if we do not take a stand...companies lile opus will never change their ways...i hope no one has to go through the ordeal ive been throughRANT OVER
744|I had just opened my first shop, a little independent clothing boutique, and was bulldozed by cold callers as soon as I connected the phone supply.I signed a verbal agreement over the phone to Opus, afterwards feeling naive and stupid for being cleverly pushed into it. A few months later, having set up direct debits with the company (thinking it simplest), they friend to take over GBP500 out of my account. My bill is usually GBP32. I complained to a manger and he sent a letter of apology.Then they did it again the next month!!I now pay over the phone each month, instead of direct debit, as I do not trust them. 
745|This company maliciously gained information off an employee and tricked us into an agreement. Possibly looking at losing my business after only being open one month. Extremely sad individuals and disgraceful company. AVOID!!! AVOID !! AVOID!! 
746|Ive been trying to get my meter relocated for the last month. So I set up an appointment after several phone calls of discusing with the dept who would actually do the work, eventually they agreed it would be them. Set up an appointment, the engineer failed to turn up, I phoned the Opus Energy and they have no idea why no one turned up, it transpired the appointment was cancelled 2 days after me booking it, I guess this was my own fault of not checking the appointment was still valid. The next appointment they gave me was 12 days later (7 business days) they thought this was acceptable. I raised a complaint and they tried to ofer me GBP65 in compensation...REALLY!!! I might add I am trying to open a business and this has delayed me by a week if not more. My complaint still outstanding and on-going. So the day of the next appointment arrives and guess what no one turns up again, give these clowns a little credit they did phone me earlier to say the engineer will definatley be on-site today...ha! So I phoned up and they say that he did turn up but know one was there, and they also tried to call me....SOMEBODY WAS THERE ALL DAY WAITING FOR YOU!!! NOTHING IS RONG WITH MY PHONE, I DID NOT RECIEVE ANY CALLS!!! Someone please tell me how I get out of this contract.To be Continued....
747|I was tricked into taking electric supply by a person claiming to be an electric meter reader when we moved into our new premises. He said he would ask Opus to contact us as 'they are the cheapest' - little did I realise at the time he was a third party broker and was paid a commission by Opus to get customers. I then agreed a contract with Opus verbally (they record calls) on the understanding they were the cheapest. Totally misled from start to finish and the bills are double what they should be. Opus won't agree to cancel my contract or move me to a better tariff. I have taken up with the Ombudsman. DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.
748|This company is absolutely disgusting the manner of the staff and the lack of regulated policies allow this company to crush small business and get away with it. As mentioned in a number of other reviews with the meters been taken. The exact same thing has happend to me. It has now been 4 weeks without any electric and I can't afford the GBP1958 that they are requesting. I have spoken to the ombudsman and this but they cannot do anything until 8 weeks has passed. This company act like raging bulls with no professionalism or consideration for their customers. The police are just as bad as they didn't even hear the case first, the simply just allowed the disconnection to go ahead. I think a complaint to watchdog should be submitted. 
749|Hi there,One day I got a phone call from a energy company and I thought it was my current supplier ovo energy and they said that I needed to renew my contract and I believed them but in fact they wanted me to switch to them opus energy which they did not say then I said I was busy could I do it another day they no no you have to do it now and then they took my bank details they said they needed it to renew contract but in fact they used it to set up a direct debit without my consent that is not right taking people bank details to do other things from now on I am not giving bank details over the phone. Opus energy tells so much lies . I really do not want to switch to them now I am stuck with them for 3 years. They will not let me cancel. Hate them. Thanks.
750|I wouldnt even give 1 star, What an awful company, lied to you and pressure you on the telephone to say yes, then say you have a verbal agreement with them. Small time desperate business. Wont be in business much longer
751|"I signed up with Opus Energy in November for electric fro 2 years and gas 1 year on A FIXED TARRIF ...........what a joke. Had a letter to say my electricity is goin up by 4% due to ""Changes to Network Charges and Renewable Obligation""   How can you have a fixed tariff only to have them increased in less than 6 months  ?  I am livid to put it mildly !!! How can they get away with this ?"
752|"I am disgusted with this company! my contract is due for renewal and the company called to renew my contract, I told them I would like to know their prices and then I would compare prices across the market for the best deal, firstly she wouldn't give me prices unless I renewed with her as she said they were the best on the market and I wouldn't need to check else where, finally 1 week later I received prices, I advised them I will compare the market and get back to them, which then the chap started reading the terms and conditions to me, he didn't listen and tried to get me to agree to tie into a new 2 year contract, I had to end the conversation by the putting the phone down as he wouldn't let me go ""as he hadn't finished the contract"" I have since been bombarded with calls from their call centre, I have had to divert my calls to my mobile and block their number via my iphone, I have emailed a complaint so shall wait to hear their response!"
753|Joined OPus 3 months ago, have never had such high bills in 7 years of trading now pay 20% vat instead of 5%, never advised that may happen because of way they bill you.  Said would get back to me following complaint in 5 days - 3 weeks ago - still waiting, cannot wait to get out of this contract
754|Over estimated bills, demand money within 14 days of invoice.Send threatening letters and pretend to be a law firm.Avoid them at all costs.  I would rather live without electric than use this company.
755|It has been over a year now since we have opus as our electricity supplier for our commercial business, and the issue we have encountered is in accessing our online account. While the billing has mostly been accurate, I did found slightly difficult accessing the online account. This was at the beginning of the contract when I had no clue how to use it. But with the help of a very nice lady, (unfortunately can't remember her name), I got to understand the whole process. Anyway, from next month I'm planning to have smart meters installed as well, as I believe they can be very handy, and I understand, accurate as well. Our contract is not fixed, so it will help us understand the billing process. Opus do offer to install them at no charge, so why shouldn't I take it? 
756|This company is out there to distroy life's I have just rang them to pay my gas bill in full as I was behind but was making payments regularly until I arranged the full amount . I rang them they says to me they have charged me GBP518 xtra for an engineer to come and discount me I found this behaviour on the phone utterly disgusting as I was pleading with this person telling them I have rang to pay my full amount why are they charging me this GBP518 for something that had not happend and to take this outrageous charge off ther repley was NO I am pretty sure this is illegal I wil b seeking legal help and making a compliant to offcom 
757|I am really upset after reading these reviews. After a call from the registrations company (that doesn't exist I have later found out) I was scared in to starting a contract with Opus.  I was told false rates about British Gas, my previous supplier.  And  I have just worked out that I will be paying more with Opus than I what I was on before .  I thought I had a cooling off period but in business I've found out you don't.  These vultures who call themselves brokers should be stopped!This way of selling should be made illegal & I am disgusted that companies like Opus use these scare tactics to gain customers.   I am  disappointed that I have been trapped in this way.  I will be seeking legal action.
758|Whilst they may seem cheap initally after the contract rolled on and the rate doubled. We never received any communication from them. They are refusing to discuss this at all as we now appear to be 'locked in' to a further 15 months - the contract lenght has been extended as well. Avoid.
759|"Opus Energy are killing my small business. We were paying GBP70 a month with our previous suppliers and moved because Opus ""seemed"" the best deal. After 3 months of being with Opus my bills shot up to GBP150+ per month.PLEASE BE WARNED DO NOT ENTER A CONTRACT WITH OPUS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT LATER"
760|Last year we switched providers after a cold call (which I normally hang up on!) from opus. It happened we were unhappy with our current provider at the time because we were paying way over the odds and they were not budging on price. So we decided to change as the quote from opus was cheaper and getting a smart meter installed was important to us. During the switchover, there was a bit of an issue with the billing but overall I have been happier than I was with my previous supplier and as a bit of a tree-hugger I'm pleased some of the energy we use is renewable. 
761|I got a phone call 9am in the morning by a guy who without introducing who he was told me that the landlord asked him to call us to arrange the new electricity contract for the business premisses we were looking to rent. Although I straight mentioned that we haven't signed any contracts yet, he said it was not a problem. I was confused, but since the landlord earlier mentioned that we will have to take care of the electricity contract somehow I assumed I had to go ahead with it. He than quoted a couple of energy supplier's prices all way above what he quoted for Opus, so I just said let's go ahead. He than told me that he can fix the prices for three years which I was quite happy about, but still confused not understanding properly what was going on. At some point he said let us now arrange a direct debit and that he would put me on a secure line. I didn't realise still what was going on and let him know our details and he nicely tied us into a 36 months contract. Tried to call him back later but he gave me a false number and by the time I found out which supplier he tied us up with (opus) our contract has gone through. We are now tied down for 36 months!!! and there is NO WAY OUT other than moving out of the premises. I admit that this is my fault as well, but I was caught by so much surprise that I can still not believe that it happened to me. I think I am a well informed person who makes decision based on research, but due to the nature of the call I still found himself in such a messy situation. I believe that other people must be tricked left right and centre by this company. I really feel sick that people like him operate legally conning others into contracts without properly letting one know what he/she is going to be entering. This sector has to be regulated as I still don't know how the provider will turn out and if we will be treated like this further, but my first experience is so Terrible with them, that I feel sick to the core by them and already thinking maybe not even going through with the contract.
762|Contract rolled on and rate doubled, never received the renewal confirmation letter, no email was sent and so you dont even know its doubled till its too late. Complained and they offered to reduce by 40%, still a 60% increase
763|I have read a few negative reviews here, but would like to say on the whole my experience with Opus has been good. There were a couple of issues when I first started using Opus' services, but these were sorted out quickly by the customer service team. Since then I have added a smart meter for my business which I am really happy about, as now I only pay for what I use and not estimates that I have been used on in the past. I also find the pricing competitive, which again is so important if you are someone like me who owns a small business and really values the pennies!!! I would certainly recommend them to other small businesses. 
764|This is a company that tricks customers on the phone by letting you think you are signing up to payments being fixed for three years then when you ask to cancel just after 24 hours they tell you that you are fixed to them for three years and that as you are a business there is no cooling off period and that is that. customer service non existing. Stay away from this company i will be complain to the offgem as this cannot be the right way to do business.
765|I would be here all day telling of my experience, but I'm a successful business man and was totally done in by this company. I wish I could leave my name on this review. I'd gladly pay people/businesses to use anyother company. Never ever even give them the time of day when they cold call you, don't even be polite do not give any details what so ever just put the phone down.
766|one of their staff call me and said we work on behalf of n power which is I am using before opus transfer it to them and they asked me for the account number and sort code then i said why do you want my account number, he said the account and sort code is for someone to put the money into your account only, but few day later they have set up the direct debit for me.This is cheating company!!!!!Please if they call you please tell them f_ _k off or you are gonna be in treble like me.
767|We took over the site 3 months ago. They were charging us a pay as you go rate, even tho we contacted them at least 4 times confirming we are happy to be their new customer. When finally got to the point they created a new account they informed me all prices did not include VAT. I accepted it. Then they informed me payments made by card or cash (non-direct debit) will increase my bills by extra 7.5% --- we have now EXTRA 27,5%!!! but well. Still accepted the prices with VAT and signed up for a direct debit. They collected the money and now I received a letter from debt colletors. YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING M E!!!! I spent ages on the phone and written loads of emails. They are just a trouble makers.  would never - NEVER - I mean N E V E R recommend them to anyone.
768|Whatever you do, DO NOT entertain OPUS, if they call HANG UP, if they come to your door ASK THEM TO LEAVE.......... I WILL BE FORWARDING MY EXPERIENCES TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ON FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, VIBER AND TANGO to make them FOREWARNED. The more people that know, the more it will affect OPUS; people will stay away and be wary, the aim should be 'NO NEW CUSTOMERS'for Opus. MY STORY: A contract had been taken by a Co Freeholder for his business the CONTRACT clearly stated the prices but Lo and behold the INVOICES are charged at a higher rate. Amounts are taken by DD and 90 days before end of contract notice is sent to OPUS to terminate contract, OPUS refused to terminate saying it was too late when in fact it was within the time stipulated. Best thing about it is he was in CREDIT >>>> OPUS OWED HIM MONEY!!!! Again the same had happened with him for the 2nd year running he agreed to prices and the prices on the INVOICES were near enough 1.5 x TIMES more than AGREED!!!!!! In total he had paid just under GBP15000.00 but only used GBP12500.00 electricity.............. BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE for OPUS ENERGY THEY WANT ANOTHER GBP2570.00 for the OVERCHARGES ON THE TARIFFS! Now it gets even more interesting MAYBE someone can help me on this because the Co Freeholder after having enough closed up shop and left this after informing OPUS that the outstanding amounts are in dispute. I being the other Freeholder went in and started my own business but guess what after constantly banging on about getting an account and having a bill in my name (and not getting one SINCE MARCH 2013)I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO PAY GBP3900.00 without an INVOICE or a breakdown of usage by there heavy handed tactics and they are demanding a further GBP8800.00 a total of GBP12,700 this for 6 months usage, WELL OPUS I DO NOT HAVE A FACTORY BUT ONLY A GROCERY SHOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OPUS wants to disconnect next week, they have already obtained a warrant and have offered no resolution to my problem of being in supply with them but NO ACCOUNT and are charging OUT OF CONTRACT RATES (this since June 2013), but refuse to give me an account so I may get myself better tariffs. EVERYONE HERE ON THIS SITE MUST HAVE COMPLAINED TO EITHER THE OMBUDSMAN (like I) OR WATCHDOG BUT ANY ACTION????? IT SEEMS THERE ARE NO AFFECTS BUT A DROP IN SALES WILL BRING THERE ATTENTION UP SOMEWHAT. ADVICE TO ALL>>>>>>>>>>> MUST CIRCULATE TO ALL CONTACTS IN PHONE, >>>>FACEBOOK, TWITTER, WHATSAPP and emails let everyone know. 'BEWARE AND STAY AWAY FROM OPUS ENERGY LTD'.
769| I have a friend who is going through a very similar thing with Opus. A representative from Opus walked into her shop with an appointment to offer her this so called great deal. She was told that they will supply gas for her business but not her home as they do not supply domestic. They then put her home address as well as her business even though she does no run her business from that address. When she disputed it, they told her that she gave those details ( which she obviously didn't). She said she refuses to pay for her home address as she did not sign up for that. They called the police to her home while she was at work and the took her meter. She tried to get a new supplier who said they cannot do it without a meter and Opus told her that in order for her to get the meter back she will have to pay GBP2000, which she cannot afford. She has 3 children, one of them is unwell and she has had no heating for 3 weeks. When she spoke to customer service she was told that all of a sudden they DO supply for homes and they may have been a mistake. They offered no support or apology and are still requesting the payment. She has no meter and, no heating and NO hotwater. Did I mention she has children! I really want to help her but don't know how. This cannot be right. I need help on who we can turn too. Its a disgrace!
770|I recently took over a business in Newport and being new to the amazing world of electricity supply took a contract out with Eon (198 per month) and it took 1 month to transfer the contract to Eon!!!?. However, Opus had the contract on that address . I was told, they were the suppliers and even though I took a contract with Eon, I still owed them money to the tune of est GBP1600. I then supplied meter readings to them. They bill suddenly reduced to GBP817.00. I then found out they are charging me out of contract rates, which I was told they have the right to charge. I am presently disputing this with Abbot Debt Recovery who have reduced the bill to GBP500.00. So the amount that I actually owe is probably half that as Abbot will aim to make fees from a new comer. Will keep you updated. 
771|Opus energy have a clause in the fine print which enables them to put up the unit cost at any time and as many times as they wish and they do just this. So, if you believe that you have entered into a fixed rate contract for 1 year or more, forget it. They put up my unit rates 4% within 2 months of entering into a 1 year fixed contract and now the unit price is 20% more. They say it is their pass through rate clause so if their costs go up they simply pass it on directly to their customer even though the customer thinks from the outset that they are on a fixed rate. They are nonchalant when challenged and see your renewal as a drop in the ocean compared to all the new suckers ( like me) that will sign up with them on their cheap 'fixed' rates only to see them go up though the fixed price contract. 
772|Don't do it, don't use Opus. I'm a new, small business and have just been on the phone discussing my third complaint. I've only been with them since April. It's their customer service that's the problem. The prices are fine (when billed correctly). After my second refund/complaint I received excellent customer care and was happy that everything was resolved only to discover another withdrawal from my bank account without having received an invoice. All the money I have saved with them I have spent on phone bills and bank charges! Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
773|I was beginning to lose all hope in opus after I experienced constant battling with trying to have my complaint resolved. After extensive phone calls and expressing my dissatisfaction with the way in which their credit department dealt with my wife, I spoke with a representative who could not have been more helpful. After raising my complaint they seemed to redeem themselves through extensive ways of ensuring this was resolved. She kept in contact with myself when promised, something which is often promised but certainly not adhered to. As far as the customer service goes for this one, they certainly redeemed themselves and I would be more than happy to continue with them on that basis. The credit department are not so accommodating, and i believe they could certainly improve they way in which they teat their customers! however, the way in which it was followed up restored all good faith in opus energy. 
774|I am just switch my business electricity and gas to Opus. I hope to save move money of course, but when I received the contract, the price are different. I call them, and they said they can confirm my verbal agreement with this price. Yes, I did agreed on the verbal agreement but before the verbal agreement, there has a lot of conversation about the price and I am sure I have confirm the discount price with the direct debit (which I am thinking to pay by DD), so on my note, I have write down the discount price and the original price (verbal agreement), I thinks the agreement on verbal contract because they cannot guarantee the customer will going to pay by DD if they tell the discount price, and if the customer not to pay by DD then they will have the problem to increased the price back to the normal price. So I think I will get the discount price when I pay by DD, but when I call them, they told I pay this price with DD, if not DD will be more higher and this higher price I have never heard from that customer service staff. I request for the full conversation recording CD, and they said they cannot guarantee will have one in case that is not recording. I just feel like been tricks, the prove of the un-agreed price has a recording, but the details of the conversation hasn't or may be unavailable. and I found that the price are actually more expensive than my current supplier if using this price. I am trying to cancel the contract now (but it seem unlikely I can do that), but I hope I can get the full conversation CD as the prove of the price.
775|"I lost faith in human nature due to opus (hopeless Energy) there credit control staff are as Rude as you will ever get as an example, In may i this year my father sadly passed away, on the day on his funeral we traveled from Yorkshire to Birmingham after a return journey of 11 hours and as you can imagine a very stress full and emotional day we received a telephone call from opus energy at 7.50 pm, the girl from Opus asked for me, my wife explained the funeral etc etc and that i was to upset to talk to anyone, the opus employee started ranting down the phone, ""well someone must be looking after things"" my wife again explained to her, she again started ranting and threatening that we will have our supply cut off if she cant speak to me, my wife put the phone down only to be called back by the same girl shouting ""did you put the phone down on Me"" my wife said yes, "" you have alot to learn with your compassion and manors"" and again put the phone down, she called back so i took the call and was amazed at how rude and thoughtless she could be, I complained to Opus the next day but never got a single letter of apology, and guess what? we never owed a single penny at the time, our bill was paid in full the previous week online but they tried to take out a duplicate of the invoice by direct debit which i had cancelled.Opus energy break just about every code of practice going, i cancelled my contract in March 2013 for the termination on the 30th June, they refused to allow my switch to EDF stating they had not received the cancellation and so doubled my charges, i did not let it rest and today they have changed there story by admitting that they did receive my termination letter, I am now waiting a call to see what they are going to do about it,   "
776|We are a small deli (just like other people have written they are small businesses seemingly affected by opus).  When we moved into the premises we were awaiting a bill as we had no way of finding out who supplied the premises with Electricity (there is no gas at the premises) but continued to be bombarded with salesmen and phone calls to get us to go over to them.  In the meantime, I did some hefty research and found Opus to be the cheapest supplier at the time (but failed to look at any reviews).  I decided I would go for Opus as my best interest was keeping costs down as I had only just started my business, and after getting a rediculous bill for GBP350 electric from British Gas, it only paved the way to Opus.The long and short of it, we ended up with Opus on a very good tariff and whilst our bill naturally fluctuated,we never had reason to complain.  However, January this year our contract ended but I wasnt informed that our tariff would be almost double what we were on.  When I queried this, the advisor pointed me to a letter they had sent me.  It was a load of Jargon about what they are doing and how they improve services, and RIGHT AT THE BACK ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE is the new tariff - if you ask me, a clever way to disguise  the fact they are binding into another tariff that costs you twice as much, but if you want a cheaper one you have to phone up.  Well, after much conversation, the advisor put me on a tariff that was virtually the same as the previous one I was on (12p per KWh), if I stayed with them for 2 years!!!  Stupidly I agreed, as I thought that would be the end of it, but it was only to be the start.  My bills were around GBP120 - GBP170 a month, some because of winter, some because of other issues etc etc but basically I was happy, then after I joined their two year contract, I was faced with a GBP30 increase in my bill each month but no explaination why this was happening.  We have now dramatically cut down our useage (by about half) but we are receiving bills of GBP286!!! PER MONTH!!!! JUST ELECTRIC!!!I have written an email voicing my concern, but I fear they wont be doing anything about it.....Anyone help me tackle the problem?  Over the winter (when we used electric appliances and tumble dryer to keep warm) our bill was around GBP130-GBP170.  Over the summer it is now GBP286 AND we have cut our useage!
777|I had a small bussiness and a company signed me up to a 3 year contract , they were very helpfull and very understanding the were called energi save online and i lovely lady helped me to sort out my metre and there issue , i would highly recommend this company to all small bussiness

780|I run a small bussines a salesman came in and offered us rates that was better then what we where paying at the time so i said we will go with opus when our contract expires he said no need he will do it streight away i was surprised by this but said its common practise with OPUS to make up false documents in order to change from say E-ON to OPUS bare in mind i was paying 2.84 per unit with E-ON and he offered me 2.16 per unit foolishly i agreed.A week later another sales guy said he will beat any price we are paying right now after i told him the company name and what price we where paying he said its impossible what im saying and that ive been tricted, he said its the worse company ever to deal with and the first sales guy would have got paid for my contract about GBP800 and i should cancel contract ASAP.I did some reasearch and found what he said was true but OPUS would not let me have my cooling off period saying it was too late but they will see what they can do for me, time went by nothing no contact from them.Me having 2 jobs did not have time to chase them up anymore.The bills where quite reasonable at the being but about 6 months later they sent us a bill of over GBP3600 i called and immediatly they said it was right the shock was that i was paying over 5.76 per unit more then double from what i was told i complained about this the said we agreed to this ect which was not true.Payment demands came thick and fast every few days i just did not have the money to pay this amount and or would they except slow payments.They have some nasty guys there calling 1-5 times a day threating to disconnect you within 2 hours if i did not pay the bill, even i knew that they need a court order in order to do this but i tell you he was convincing.Anyway before i knew it they got a court order and they came to remove the meter they added soo many other fees to be expected i guess fortunalty all my staff paid with bill some how between them a blessing is all i can say.We paid over double the yearly bill almost closed down our business something i wish no one else to go through.HOW TO GET OUT OF YOUR CONTRACT!!!!!!!The only way i managed to get out from them was to get my landlord to agree to sell my business to another member of staff made up tenancy agreements so i can move away from them and go to another company.I did say im going to report them to watchdog trust me they did'nt care only thing that bothered them was when i said i will also report them to http://www.ombudsman-services.org/ then he went silent alittle.I HOPE EVERYONE AFFECTED MAKE A EFFECT TO MAKE A COMPLAINT SOME HOW WITH ITS JUST A REVEIW ON HERE OR MORE COMPANIES LIKE THESE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH IT.Good luck all
781|Opus Energy seem to employ agents who cold call people and persuade them to open energy accounts for a property for which the person has no authority to transfer the account. Trying to sort out the shambles that Opus Energy has created is a nightmare.
782|Recently opus sales team tricked me into new contract for the business. Electricity and gas. This contract is for 24 month. Please be aware they DO NOT OFFER ANY  COOLING OF PERIOD and their charges are sky high. Plus please remember to cancal the contract two month in advance near to the end of contract, other wise they will beind new contract without your knowledge making it impossiable to move to other provider. They also place fines for canceling the contract.My recommedition for this company stay away. Do NOT sign the contract. Stay away.
783|A tenant in the same building as us, changed supplier from Eon to Opus, Opus made the change to our supply and the tenants who requested the change. Although two individual meters, both were changed rather than the one requested, the client was subsequently charged for both meters. We have been chasing our landlord for electricity bills for 2 years, finally discovering bills being paid by this other company. By word of mouth only, this company has had the amount fully credited back to themselves and we have been sent an invoice for nearly GBP2000. This invoice penalise us for being out of contract, has hugely increased standing charge and inflated per unit tariff. The original bill to this client was GBP460.78, they are attempting to invoice us GBP1977.28The original standing charge per day was 17.32, they are charging us 76p, the original tariff was 12.881 p per kWh, they are charging us up to 17.56.We acknowledge us of the electricity and will pay a fair price, but the approach they are taking is absurd, we never entered into a contract with them and nor did the landlord who is equally angry with the outcome.
784|We are a firm of Solicitors. Our standing order was for about GBP200 per momth. Suddenly we got a bill for five times that so cancelled standing order immediatley pendind clarification. They claim existing contract ended in February and we had been written to three months earlier to advise of automatic renewal if we did not give them notice. No such letter was received and they were advised of this. I have a recording of their conversation with an unauthorised member of staff. That person claimed that was too bad but the contract had been automatically renewed and it was now too late to change. They phoned the next day offering to cut the tarriff. Staff member listened to their pitch but said,again recorded, that the figures could have been in French for all she understood.Notwithstanding they have refused to allow a transfer to another supplier which I do not believe they can do. Probably a tactic to bump up severence penalty .Avoid like the plague.Tom QueenThomas Queen SolicitorsPS I wonder when they wiil call ?
785|DO NOT TOUCH THIS VILE, ROBBING, LIEING COMPANY ~ AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE AND ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR THEM SHOULD BE ASHAMED... This company is getting away with bankrupting Britain's small businesses. They are chasing me for a couple of grand even though they robbed me blind, well sorry OPUS YOU WILL NEVER GET THIS COUPLE OF GRAND ~ AND I DO HOPE WE GO TO COURT!!! I WOULD RATHER GOTO JAIL THAN PAY THIS COMPANY WHAT THEY SAY I OWE... WAS PROMISED A GOOD DEAL FOR MY DUAL FUEL ~ GUESS WHAT HAPPENED???? YEP ~ I WAS CHARGED THE EARTH ~ DOUBLED MY BILL FROM GBP600 PER MONTH TO ATLEAST GBP1200 PER MONTH. THEN WHEN I STARTED STRUGGLING WITH PAYING DOUBLE THE COST, THEY WOULD NOT LET ME GO FREE ~ SO WHEN MY END OF CONTRACT CAME ~ DECIDED TO CHARGE DOUBLE AGAIN ~ AT ONE POINT I WAS PAYING GBP3000 PER  MONTH.... HORRENDOUS COMPANY ~ I TELL EVERY BUSINESS NOT TO USE THIS COMPANY OR YOU WILL GOTO THE WALL....
786|"Before we opened a place in town, we received a call from a ""broker"", they said opus is now our new energy supplier. ""cheapest in town"". 2 year contract. Verbal agreement.6 months later, our bills went higher and higher. After the first year, it went even higher to a stage we couldn't cope. A monthly gas and electric hit an all time high at GBP3500 a month. They said....it's in the contract. We were paying at least 40% more than the average supplier. A friend in the same business, who's business exceeds GBP20.000 a week pays less than I do 4 times the business I make.When companies were charging 3.5p per unit. OPUS were charging 5.75p per unit for gas.And electric 5 pence over the top.The ""broker""......is an employee os Opus, he was the one also chasing us for payment,.Threatening cut off letters plus charges. Nice company.Just pure lies and lies.Not to be trusted, closed down now. Due to we were working for Opus at the end of the day, not the other way round.Now they asking for proof of closed down shop and new tenancy agreement with the landlord. Beggars belief. I'm going to sign on tomorrow.Thank You Opus. You have 9 families facing the dole que."
787|OMG WERE DO I START ??? I NEED HELP THIS COMPANY !!! THEY RIP YOU OFF AND HOW THESE PEOPLE SLEEP AT NIGHT I HAVE NO IDEA. I HAVE SPENT 12 MONTHS NOW FIGHTING MY ACCOUNT THAT OPUS ENERGY NOW SAY I OWE OVER GBP2000 BUT WAS ORIGINALLY OVER GBP3000 BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THEIR MIND. THEY HAVE EVEN GOT THEIR OWN DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY, SAYS IT ALL DOESNT IT.I QUERIED MY VERY LARGE BILLS 12 MONTHS IN MARCH GONE, TO MY SURPRISE THAT I NOW OWE THEM OVER GBP2000 BECAUSE THEY HAD UNDERSTIMATED MY GBP300 BILLS, I AM A VERY SMALL BUSINESS WITH A FLAT ATTACHED SO HOW ARE MY BILLS THIS LARGE I THINK I AM PAYING FOR BLACKPOOL ILLUMINATIONS HA SINCE JUNE 2012 THEY FITTED A SMART METER AND NOW MY BILLS ARE GBP39 PER MONTH BUT THEY STILL CANT TELL ME WHY THERE IS SO MUCH DIFFERENCE, I HAVE BEEN PASSED FROM PILLAR TO POST AND NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT APART FROM WHAT I OWE THEM AND THEY DEFINATELY SAY I DO. I HAVE LOOKED ON REVIEWS AND THEY HAVE EVEN PUT PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY OWE, I WAS A POINT OF DECIDING TO GO BANKCRUPT MYSELF BUT I AM NOT GOING TO LET THEM DO THIS TO ME WHEN I HAVE WORKED SO VERY HARD SOMEONE PLEASE HELP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
788|Business owners beware! DO NOT GO WITH OPUS ENERGY FOR YOUR ELECTRICITY AND GAS SUPPLY!!! They will systematically bleed you dry. They are without doubt the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of being involved with. They disputed my start read, and my end read (multiple times) and charged in excess of GBP4000 over the course of a year! They are terrible! What's annoying is that I have to keep supplying meter readings... I have a smart meter... Which they didnt know until the end of my contract! GRADE A DOUCH BAGS! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT AND WITHOUT DOUBT THE WORST COMPANY I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH! Do not trust opus! 
789|After having no problems for the first two years upon my contract coming up for renewal I received no renewal letter. I rang Opus to check about the renewal letter and they stated they had sent one and that the period for negotiating the contract was passed.I was happy to stay with Opus originally but have I see no way that two renewal letters (Electric and Gas) got lost in the post and consider them to be using very dishonest tactics to gain extortionately higher tariffs.I will be taking it up with the ombudsman as I consider their methods totally illegitimate.
790|I stupidly open an account with these swines, they took GBP1400+ for a GBP350 bill and now refuse to refund it in case they get THE REFUND WRONG!!!I'm told to phone back on a weekly basis which I do only to get another excuse and told to call back the following week - lots of apologies etc but no money.  I'm running on an overdraft and this is the reward I get for signing up.IF YOU SO MUCH AS HEAR THE WORK OPUS RUN LIKE HELL
791|Once we had signed up to OPUS they then hit us with a GBP1,000 Security Bond and GBP408.52 reconnections fee. None of this was mentioned before we entered into the contract and when we said no we cant pay that they said pay first (we have copies of the telephone calls) then once you are reconnected you can go elsewhere and get your GBP1,000 back. They have now said by email that they have made some errors with our account but we are stuck and will not get our GBP1,000 back until the 24 months are up. We are a small business and have just started we cant afford to loose GBP1,000.00  
792|As others have said, drawn in by THE initial reasonable offer only to be hammered later with over inflated exorbitant prices on a fixed contract.No reference made to contract date on any bill.No reference made to imminent contract renewal period made on any bill.One letter a year sent, full of boring obfurscation to bury essential facts, obviously paying lip service to the law with no interest in conveying the importance of the missive, just shortsighted short term 'cleverness'.Obviously have no interest in establishing or maintaining any degree of customer loyalty, I will do my utmost to deter others.Morally unsound, only exist to prey on the harassed small business owner.Opus? 'opeless! SHAME ON YOU!!
793|While waiting for the contract to end, which we couldn't wait, being told its been rolled on for a further 6months.  By law,  rolling over contracts has been banned in 2012.Secondly, the persons name on the account, doesn't mean anything anymore, it's the companies that they are  after for the payment......according to Opus.Also, your contract is tide in with your lease of your business, so you will need to get a new lease from your landlord. Or close your business down!!!.......according to Opus.We had an estimated bill.....over 1000 units.....but we had to pay full estimated bill or they cut us off. When I argued....they said, they can reduce the next payment....by any good business, how about a correct bill sent out!!But noooooooooo........I have drafted up an email to OFGEM and WATCHDOG.Now waiting how they deal with this!!
794|Competitive rate for the 1st year to snare you. BEWARE though, because after the initial contract period, the renewal prices are hiked by 60% ++ You will be automatically locked into 12 month further contract if you don't cancel or renegotiate within 90 days before the expiry of the initial contract. As a customer you are required to remember to renegotiate within the 90 day window before the contract expires, and yes they do send a reminder, the one we received was headed 'More than just supply- Gas, Cleaner Power and Energy Efficiency advice' The 1st paragraph starts 'Lots of businesses are concerned about their carbon footprint, and saving energy is not only good for the environment but good news for your business expenses' Buried in the second paragraph and conveniently hidden on the back of the letter is a note about your 'new (grossly inflated) tariff' giving just 30 days to respond. AVOID OPUS ENERGY and choose a supplier with ethical practices and care about their customers.
795|since taking over our business in september 2012 we have been stuck with opus and being charged a ridiculously high out of contract rate to the point that they are charging us approx GBP200-GBP300 a week for electricity and not much less for the gas. when they did finally read our meters we had been overcharged by GBP500 but as the bill has escalated due to the pub business dying and not being able to afford their bills we are now threatened with having our supply disconnected. As the business premises has our living accommodation attached and i am in poor health and have a child living with us then we will lose our business and our home. subsequently my child will be put into care as we will have no where to live so opus will have succeeded in breaking up a family and taking a child away from his parents and leaving 2 people living on the streets. everytime i have tried to come to a payment arrangement with opus i am being told that paying GBP200 a week will not cover our usage. I think i am powering the whole street.hope you sleep well at nights because my partner and I don't with the stress and worry you have caused us.
796|I was called when I moved my business premises, inviting me to switch suppliers to Opus, as they were the cheapest in the area. My first months bill was completely inaccurate, although this wasn't helped by my previous supplier providing incorrect reads. Previous supplier sorted the problem relatively quickly, Opus took 7 months to update their information, with no apology for the mess about (I was informed by my previous supplier that each time they tried to provide Opus with the correct reads, Opus rejected them because they were different to the reads they had, and there was a big difference).I have since tried to cancel my contract, but have been rudely informed that I am in a 2 year contract so no way of swapping away from them, their rudeness, and ridiculous prices. Stay well away from them!
797|Set up a restaurant 2 years ago and got caught out into a gas contract with Opus from an 'independent' broker, when we tried to get out it was too late but didn't quite realise how much we were going to be overcharged as we'd just moved into a newly renovated building.  We were given estimated bills of just under GBP500 p/month until Jan 2012 when we were hit with an actual bill off GBP7,000, splitting the bill in half over 2 months was the best the customer services could do!  We've been paying about GBP5,000 a year over the odds and despite contacting them and explaining over and over how it was crippling our cash flow they did nothing to help.  They then had the cheek to call with the offer of a renewal quote nearly matching what we had been quoted from our new supplier.  Too little, too late! I would avoid this company at all costs, if we treated our customers the way they have treated me we would have closed months ago!!
798|I had just had a call from Opus Energy, during which their sales person told me to **** off.?? Why would i want to switch my business to them if they cant handle questions to their cold call.??
799|My daughter has just taken over a premises for a screen printing shop . She was in the process of dealing with a reputable supplier for her electric/gas 
800|Hi, STAY AWAY from this company, they will overcharge you, keep you in a long c0ntract, rude customer service, will c0n you in to believing they are the cheapest energy company around via cold callers who work on commission. Their Process for getting out of a c0ntract is a complete nightmare. Had a 2 year contract but moved premises after a year due to silly energy bills (GBP300 a month for a few lights and one computer). You would imagine leaving an energy company would be easy but its a lengthy and stressful procedure involving solicitors.After I had cancelled my direct debit due to no longer at the unit they still wanted to charge even though the electric was switched off by the landlord, to make matters worse after 30 days they sent threatening letters including a bill from the solicitors for GBP5000When moving in to a new unit got numerous phone calls from cold callers asking me I am on an emergency rate and I need to switch urgently to opus energy as they are the cheapest in the area. The emergency rate is still cheaper than Opus Energy according to my first bill.Avoid all the hassle and silly prices by sticking with a familiar name.And tell their cold callers to $$$$ $$$
801|I took over a business in November 2012, the previous owners monthly bill was approximately GBP70 per month, mine have been around the GBP200 mark each month & after a few calls I still didn't get a good answer, I asked for a new Smart Meter & was told that I'd have to pay for it, it cost a lot to phone up & your waiting ages for a answer to any question, I will not be staying with them after my year is up.      
802|"out of GBP57 they make GBP117 as I have ""paid too late"" but I never received a letter saying that I have to pay anything. "
803|The worst company I made mistke join ds one  I'm warnin pepole dnt join opsy energy they scank pepole join eon.they the best 
804|Opus Energy was recommended by an energy comparison website for my small pub. I have a smart meter but the bills were never correct, I then got a bill for over GBP4,000 
805|We enter a business contract with Opus for 1 year, because they previous supplier and they offered an excellent rate. But, problems started after first invoice. They tried invoice us for previous tenants energy usage, which was never paid. After two months, this was resolved, after many phone calls.The latest problem, is that we forgot that our contract was going to expire and Opus never sent a letter or email to inform this going to happen. At beginning year, they started charging us 7p more for a unit and 5p more a day for the standing charge. But, the worst part, was that Opus Energy informed us that we automatically entered another contract for a year. Even though that we had not signed anything or agreed to this new price!Be warned, the suck you in with a great price, but they penalize you don't change suppliers at end of the 1st year!  
806|"I am ashamed to say I have been duped into a contract with OPUS by their cold call team (which they then absolutely refuse to refer to when complaining), they caught us at a vulnerable time when setting up our new business and they promise the best offer out there ""which beats everyone"" then you end up with the worst and ""you need to sign now to avoid big charges"".Their complaints team have one instruction ! under no circumstances give anyone their money back or end their contact. the way they work actually reminds me of the film boiler-house I cannot believe in this age a company is allowed to operate in the manner that these guys do ! they have no integrity or conscienceStay well away !!!!!!!"
807|i tried ti transfer to another COMPANY, british gas when i took over a empty SHOP. next thing opus energy phone up and say i owe the previuos tennents BILL. i refused to pay his bill and supplied the tenency AGREEMENT. by then i am on a contract at rediculas RATES. i had never spoken to any one or signed any THING. now i owe GBP4,800 in 6 MONTHS.  never go near these PEOPLE. they will end up in JAIL. the quicker the BETTER.  please note any good reviews have no name ATTACHED. i wonder WHY. frank dowdall
808|I would not reccomend anyone to go with this company!!!!Myself and my partner run a pub it is our first buisness and is finally doing well after a long 7months, however the energy cost with opus has been so ridiculous that we now owe GBP9,000 how is this possible???  Not only can't we afford to pay we are continually harassed by the workers!! Our only alternative now is to go to our court date and proberbly be disconnected!!!I have heard off other land lords that they found opus very expensive and not recommended but we can't get out of the contract either!!!! 
809|I AM VERY GLAD NOW TO FIND THAT MY BILLS ARE CHAEAPER THIS IS THE ONLY SOLOUTION I GOT & THE SOLOUTION IS OPUS ENERGY.THANK GOD I GET RID OFF FROM BRITISH GAS.
810|We have a small business and are very disappointed with this company. We were conned 2 years ago into a supposedly independent energy adviser whom we think was a opus member of staff telling us there tariffs etc were the best. We were meant to be on emergency tariff which was very high like emergency tax. Being a new first business we were far too trusting. After checking this out we rang Opus back within a few hours to terminate contract but were told there was no cooling off period which we have now been informed is illegal. We stuck with it as didn't know what to do but have now found gone on to a rollover tariff which had doubled our already high bills. We should have received a letter 90 days prior to contract ending so we could cancel contract and give 30 days notice but it never came. We have spoken to customer services but have not got anywhere at all and inform us tied in for yet another 12 months. We are now seeking advice from Ombudsman and Ofgen. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
811|In 30 years of business, Opus is the worst organisation I have ever had to deal with!  I took over premises to open a new branch of my shop.  I wanted to use my regular electricity supplier but the previous tenants had been with Opus and they would not let me change until they had seen a copy of my lease!  They then sent me an estimated bill - based on the previous tenants (a cafe occupying 3 floors) whereas I am a handbag shop on the ground floor only.  I sent them a final reading and moved to the new supplier, but they refused to change the bill!  No one seems to know what anyone else is doing.  I have been told that my new supplier did not give them the figures in the correct way, told a lot of rubbish about 'industry standard practice' etc. etc.  I have received threatening letters from Abbotts Debt Recovery (who by the way appear to be owned by Opus)  but I have refused to back down and they have finally agree to settle for me paying what I actually owe them and write off the rest of my 'debt'.  Threatening to report them to Ofgen  appears to work quite well.
812|"First I must say its good to see that I am not the only one in this situation. So here it goes... My dad (the business owner) cannot speak English and therefore I tend to deal with most things but obviously I don't know everything about his business. He receives a call from someone on the 8th Feb 2013, passes my number to them so they can speak to me, and they call me (at 20:30). They tell me that they are calling from Npower (who from what I knew was the energy supplier), that the director of the business has recently changed (which is true, my dad took over a couple of months ago), and that we are being charged 30% higher because there is no contract with a supplier. So they tell me in order to not be charged this amount that we should renew the contract. They ask me if I am authorised to speak and I tell them that I tend to deal with most things because my father cannot speak English. They proceed to renew the contract (and notice, I still think I am dealing with NPower when in fact I am not), and ask me questions as to when my dad took over. I tell them I need to speak to him first because I don't know any of the information they want from me. They force me to give them any date, so I don't get off the phone and speak to my dad. I repeat that I need to speak to him, and again they find a way to keep me on the call. He then says that he needs any bank details so he can proceed to renew it. He takes my card details (and assures me that this is not to take any payment, its just to show that we have a valid English bank account), and tells me that he will call me back in 2 minutes because ""he needs to switch desks"". So he calls me back, and reads out the terms and conditions (at 200 mph speed), so that I can't understand anything. I accept it, and thats the end of it.My dad receives a letter from a company called 'Opus energy' (addressed to me, not my dad)on the 14th Feb 2013 thanking us for switching to them and confirming the direct debit details. I ring them up and ask them what the hell this means, and I get told that I have verbally agreed to a legally binding contract with them through a broker called 'Energy Direct' (I think that was the name). I explain the situation to her, confirms that its a valid contract, but if I wish to cancel then I need to wait for 5 working days for someone to get in contact me with because they need to investigate the issue. I rang NPower straight after, and they said that we are already in a contract with them until 2014, and that Opus shouldn't have been able to do this. She assures me that she will object (I can't remember the energy term she used), but basically it means that they shouldn't have been able to do this because we were already in a valid contract with them. She assures me that I shouldn't worry, and that if and when they ring, I should tell them thats in the hands of our current supplier and they will get in touch. Sigh of relief.... I receive a call this morning (Saturday, 16th Feb) from Opus, they tell me that they've investigates the issue, and listened to the recording, and concluded that there is a legally binding contract because I verbally agreed to it . Apparently I was told that I am dealing with Opus 4 times, and I told them that I was authorized to speak. I kept explaining the situation but she kept repeating herself like a parrot and by the by she was the RUDEST person I have ever dealt with in my life! I said I already have a contract with another supplier, she said they didn't object to it, and now Npower will send an objection but that Opus will reject it. She said that she'll send the verbal recording to me. But from some of the reviews I read the whole ""I'll call you back, I am switching to another desk"" was part of it! They only recorded the agreement and not the whole conversation in which they misrepresented the facts and their identity! I absolutely hate myself for falling into this trap, but as I can see they organise it in such a way that its virtually impossible not to. Is there anything that we can do? I will call NPower on Monday morning, the Ombudsman too. But can anyone advise me anything else? My dad does not want to deal with this company! "
813|Just found out that because i didn't ring up and negotiate a new contract opus have switched me to a new tariff of their choice which is nearly double the tariff i agreed with them. I never got a reminder, just a verbal contract so now i have a year of high bill.When will companies rely on service and price to keep customers and not black tactics.I will be putting my notice in at my other business addresses asell.Very PoorUntil now we had no problem with opus, the billing ect was fine. I will be spreading the bad word to let people know what they are letting themselves in for!!!
814|Its a shame that Opus Energy do not believe in investing in customer loyalty.This company have a dubious renewal system which rests on a fictitious letter sent in the post. If their is no response within a short period you will be placed on a rolling contract of 12 moths with over inflated rates. I am now taking steps against this company.
815|WITHOUT PREJUDICEI am one of the Trustees of a pension fund which owned and rented out an office premises. Unfortunately the tenants left with unpaid rent and had chosen to change electricity supplier to Opus during their tenancy. The trustees of the pension fund then became liable for the premises, but when I told our agent that I wanted to revert to the original electricity supplier, I was advised that Opus would require a not inconsiderable amount of money, already accrued apparently at their elevated prices, before they would allow the changeover. I was advised by the agent that in the interests of a quiet life it would be simpler to continue with them. The outcome was that Opus seem to have then made a verbal agreement with the agent to continue the supply, not advising me that two meters were present at the premises (ie twice the standing charge etc), and not registering my address on their system. OPUS had not made any direct contact with me or either of the other two trustees at all yet were convinced they had a formal contract with us. The pension fund sold the premises last August having paid the standing charges and minimal usage (at not necessarily minimal cost). It transpired however that one invoice had been overlooked, not surprisingly as it related to a time period already paid for, but for the second meter.This January, some 5 months after the sale of the premises, I was greeted with a letter from a debt collection agency, interestingly to my correct address although remember, I had been assured by OPUS that they had no record of it. The demand was not for a great amount - approx GBP60 - but I saw fit to complain as a) I was not aware there were two meters connected at the premises, and b) I saw no reason why OPUS themselves didn't simply call or write asking for the money.Customer complaint informed me that they had written twice previously to the letter form the debt collection agency, but admitted to sending the letters to the wrong addres. I guess the final insult was the polite man from customer complaints who sought to justify everything of course, but when I asked for a token reduction in the interest of good customer relations, and after a good deal of repeat requests, offered just 10% off the standing charge! What'll that be - a fiver? Better than nothing I guess, but not in this one instance in line with my suggested mission statement for OPUS - 'too much for too little' Anyway, it seems that I am not alone in my dissatisfaction with this supplier, so let's hope their future business is commensurate with their customer satisfaction rating.C JonesTrustee of Adrem PR SSAS
816|I completed on a pub on the 3rd December and was immediately advised to change from Opus energy for both electric and gas. I understand that they have not delayed the switch which should go through soon. Last week I was invoiced over GBP1000 for 13 days gas and electric at 95p per day and 21p per unit (6p per unit for gas) GBP24,000 a year. This is completely above board as I do not have a contract with them (we weren't open for business in this time though!).What I find quite sinister is the shameless false representation undertaken by their agents. One Scots lady calling herself Elizabeth said she was calling from the Energy Efficiancy Board once. When I asked her to clarify that she kept repeating it until becoming quite curt and hanging up. 2 Days later she called saying she was from Opus. I asked her about the earlier call and she said 'sorry, must have been having a bad day, happy christmas, bye bye!' and hung up again. She phoned again yesterday saying she was 'The Electricity, meter read department' and proceeded to ask about supply.This morning I received a very OTT 'DEMAND FOR PAYMENT' threatening legal action or disconnection proceedings over 'the debt' followed by another threat to instruct their solicitors if I do not pay immediately. Signed 'Debt Recovery Department'I am yet to receive a final invoice based on an actual meter read.Threatening, sinister, immoral - the only shame is that you're probably only reading this because you've dealt with them. If not - please don't. I'm really concerned that people are bullied into all sorts with this mob. 
817|i unfortunatly have the displeasure of dealing with this company, they conned us into switching with them. the customer service is extremly bad. so rude and no one knew what they were talking about everytime i rang there was a different story.this has been going on for over a year now and we are still battling with these people.the ammount i owe the company changes from week to week, sometimes its GBP100 more or less.cannot get a correct answer of these people, highly reccomened NO ONE to use this company, it would be far simpler to to train a hamster to run on a wheel for electric.
818|I have a small new business and was conned (by a supposedly independent energy adviser...who I now believe was part of the Opus sale team) by Opus into using them to supply my electricity! DO NOT MAKE the same mistake. Customer service is appalling (rude, ill-mannered and unhelpful) and they are so much more expensive than competitors. Unfortunately I am tied in to a 2 year contract...hopefully the ombudsman will sort out this mess! 
819|im amazed, andy nash does not exist, trust me on this, staff in the call centre are taught to be arrogant, never a manager or supervisor available, im starting to thing the energy ombudsman is stationed in the same building.please everybody complain to you local MP if you being treated like dirt by opus energy. they havent provided me with a single unit of electricity, yet they seem to bill me ? basically depressing company to deal with and i dont know how they are allowed to continue ripping small business roots out of this country, also they have avery active web presence and threaten people with legal action if you write bad thing about them. 
820|I have run a successful business for the last 12 years; recently a company adjacent to me opened and were convinced by Opus to supply their electricity. The company now say its the worst decision theyve ever made. To compound things Opus got it all wrong, they took my account with their meter number and stole my existing contract away from Scottish Power. Opus informed SP that the business had closed down and it was therefore a new contract and to release the contract to Opus, which SP did. That was May 2012, since then I have not had an electricity bill or been able to pay SP. Ive asked SP to get my account re-instated with them but they cannot as Opus wont release the account. They have now (Opus) removed my electricity meter from the national database but having spent a lot of time and effort writing to them, theyve started sending me bills. My secretary phoned them and said we were thinking of talking to The Ombudsman but Opus said that if we werent in contact to the Ombudsman why should they do anything. The electricity bills theyve now sent are incorrect and dont relate to my business or for that matter my meter, not as theyve suggest my meters(I only have one meter).They are a complete bunch of charlatans and crooks. I only hope it ends up in court as I am happy to sue their incompetent bottoms off.Idiots!
821|"I am still trying to get rid of them after several years. Beware dodgy telesales tactics. They scrupulously recorded the ""verbal contract"" but didnt record the detailed discussion where they went over my old bills told me they would save me money. When the paperwork arrived it was a lot more than I understood it would be. They then set my monthly direct debit at 3 times what I had been paying.And then, despite my best efforts to make sure I did NOT renew the contract, sure enough a contract arrived in the post. I was fuming. I only called them to give required 90 day notice. They now say I am signed up for another year and have it on disk to prove it.I wish I had just hung up on them in the first place !!!!Check them out on Consumer Forums. They are easy to find."
822|had our bills estimated over the last 6 months , even though had smart meter fitted . I called several times to rectify this however still got estimated bills !  so called to give 3 month  notice on contract, expiry Jan 2013 , and found out been paying ` out of contract rollover price ` since January 2012 .. almost twice as much as contract charges , definantly didnt recieve expiry notice last year !
823|Hi we went with this company few years ago only to find out that we have been ripped off for so many years, thanks god my contract is running out and going with eon now witch is less then half price,so I suggest to all just call other company's and compare the prices before you go with opus you'll be surprise to find the differences on price.tottal ripp off.
824|Had two sites supplied both on one year contracts. All was fine untill after a year they bumped my elec unit price to over 17p per KW. On cantacting them they said the contract had rolled over. I asked why I had not been informed and they said they had written to both sires 3 months prior to the renewal quoting the renewal prices. THEY DID NOT. I am the sole person at these sites and keep all my paper work and no renewal notice was sent to either site. I questioned it with them and they said it was too late and tough basically. Will be writing to give them 9 months notice of cancellation and will request written confirmation of receipt of this notice will also be contacting Energy ombudsman about the fact I believe they are deliberately not sending out these notices to trap people into their extortionate rates. Basically don't go with them and If you do give them cancellation notice as soon as you do so they can not roll you over and screw you over.
825|Got a call yesterday, from a guy called Luke, who deals in accounts for Opus.it got a bit heated, he demanded payment as were late to pay the bill. he told me the bill was late, i told him that we didnt recieve the bill! then he said, we sent it by e-billing, i asked him who to?, he said ....Mr.XXXX, then i told him that he left the company about 6 weeks ago, and Mr.XXXX had phoned up to make last payments to clear the accounts. he replied....no records!!anyway. it was around 5.50pm. i had told him that i need a bill to pay the bill, i didnt have enough in my own account, if he could send me a bill, i can pay it, when i receive the bill.this is the conversation.Luke:So , you are saying that you cannot pay the bill?me: yes, until you send me a bill with the paying slip.Luke:There will be a charge for late payment then.....GBP67.50, for late payment.me: which energy companies charges their customers for late payments?Luke: Banks do!!!! So are you going to pay now, with your debit card or credit card then?me: i dont have enough to pay the bill then very moment as the banks are closed.Luke: ok, fine....if you dont call me back by 6pm tonight, there will be a GBP67.50 charge!(it was well gone past 6pm now!!!)Bad Opus, employing bad attitude people.JOKE
826|This company use a broker called The Business Energy Company - salesman (Kevin Mason).  I got a message from my shop that Iqram from Eon (our current supplier) had called and needed to active our account and left a number for me to call.  We had just moved into a new property, didn't give it too much though -  I was about to call Eon anyway to give a meter reading and had their paperwork in my hand ready to call.  I called and spoke to Iqram, who passed me on to Kevin Mason, who was very personable (at the time).  he was very convincing and persuaded me to go to Opus.  It was the very end of the conversation that set the alarm bells ringing when he said if you get any more phone calls from other suppliers just take no notice they will lie to you, tell you anything you want to hear to get your business.  I thought this just doesn't sound right and began to wonder who I was dealing with.  I called my husband who is the owner of our business and he blew a fuse.  He was at the shop when Iqram called earlier (claiming to be calling from Eon) and was outraged at the way they blatantly lied about who they were in order that we returned their call!!  He called Kevin straight back to cancel (this is within the hour) but all he did was give my husband lots of verbal abuse finishing off by saying that as it had been recorded basically, tough you are locked in now.  It was our understanding that in any business whether written or verbal there is a cooling off period - usually 14 days where you get a chance to change your mind when products are sold - from what is basically a cold call.  This was less than one hour!!!!!!!!!   What do I do now, I don't want to use Opus?
827|Dear readers I am one of those unlucky one's having to deal with opus energy. I am a new owner of a small takeaway and as you would first thing I did as soon as I took over the business checked the current suppliers of gas and electricity, and to my horror I find OPus energy is supplying the electricity. Having checked this site before I took over the business I read a lot of reviews about this company ripping off people, I have even read some people have had nervous breakdowns because of this good energy suplyer. I called opus energy to tell them I am the new tenant and I was asked to provide them with my tenancy agreement papers. Once I sent the documents over to them they said it will take ten days. So I called after ten days, I was told the agreement documents I sent was not sufficient and the person I need to speak with is not here and they cannot help me. From this I realised they are trying to drag this thing on because that way they can charge me out of contract rates for a while. When I finally got to speak with the relevant person she told me I need to get a solicitors document to prove I am the new tenant of this property. I didn't see why this was necessary because they asked for the agreement papers between me and the landlord which I provided so this proved that they are after the out of contract rates from me. It has now been 6 weeks, so I called consumer direct told them what's going on, they said to provide them with this solicitors letter and they will keep this case open as long as opus has not settled the matter. The day I got a letter from the solicitor I found a letter from opus energy to the current tenant, this was a bill 690 pounds that hasn't been paid by the previous tenant, the letter stated if payment was not made immediately the supply will be disconnected. This was scary as I has only been about 6 weeks I had opened the takeaway. I called opus and told them why I should pay this and I was told by a very ignorant nasty person I should pay at least 300 pounds that way they will call the disconnect tion off for 7 days if nothing was paid today then it will be disconnected within 24 hours. So I had no choice but to pay 300 pounds, I was assured this 300 pounds will be transferred to my account once the account has been put to my name. Two months has passed I finally got a call to say account has been changed to my name. I called a different energy company got into a contract with them. I have now received a bill from opus for over 600 pounds as I thought they did not deduct the 300 pounds I had paid them. I was also told they will be giving me a 20 percent discount on the final bill they send me that has not happened. I now have received another letter after 3 days stating if I don't pay them immediately my supply will be disconnected. Dear readers BEWARE of this company every single person I spoke to is RUDE, ARROGANT and a LIER. They cannot be compared with normal human beings. And by the way I read a lot of reviews were a ANDY NASH says he is sorry and he can be contacted and so on, well there is no Andy NAsh because I have tried contacting this so called andy nash. This country is a civilised country people work very hard to make an honest living, but every person who work for opus energy have lost their dignity and morality or never had any to begin with. I almost feel sorry for these people I just don't get it that after a hard day of cunning people how do you people sleep at night. I hope the readers can understand why I titled the mental depression.
828|went to take over a small hotel,and the owner was on the phone with a sales person from opus,he handed me the phone and i got talking,thinking the previous owner was just changing details over to myself, and it was a really bad line,i ended up being landed into a contract for 3 years,which proved to be very expensive.be warned.dont touch them with a barge pool.
829|Absolute rip off dearest energy supplier ever...trying to charge GBP260 for electric in a small shop for 3 months yeah right....my electric cost GBP170 for 3 months in a house will be cancelling and going to a different supplier!!!
830|I took over a small business and decided to stay with opus, but it was bad decision , every month I receive solicitor letter demanding payments for the bills I never receive and when I contact them what is payment regarding they said they sent me a bill and want payment from card right now with card which I refuse to do it , how many times it is possible that they send me a bill which I never receive.So I am thinking of contacting trading standards now as you should receive your bill by post or email and then you should have 2 weeks to pay it.Aboslutely disgusted with opus cant wait to contract finish so i can move to some other company.   
831|Took over a shop last summer, previous owner call British Gas to change user. They took the details and said will call back. 2 minutes later, a man said he was working with British Gas that everything were under control, they even have my co reg. number. 10 minutes later, The real British Gas called and went through the same thing with me. I said to them I have spoken with your colleague. Then penny dropped, British Gas called the number the other man who have left me, they turn out to be Opus Energy!!!They took over the account eventually, now I have a yearly summary bill for GBP1980.00!! I have paid my bill up to date...What can I do apart from Screaming and swearing !!!
832|My advice to anyone is stay well clear of Opus Energy, they're a rip off company that intice & encourage people to join up & sign a 2 year contract witha competitive rate & then put the rates up straight away.when I first bought my business they rfang me & quoted me a competitive rate then after I told them I would think about it I received a letter that they were transfering me from my current supplier to Opus & when I told then that I hadn't agreed to join but had told then I would consider it they said NO NO U VERBALLY SAID YES now your in a contract so eventually I stayed with them.  I've gotta small business & my average bill is GBP1200 a month & they want thir money straight away NO GRACE & before you can ask em to try & make instalment payments every week they send a solicitors threatening letter out of disconnection within 7 days plus solicitor costs, court costs, disconnection fees, reconnection fees & a further GBP5000 bond etc.a trerrible inconsiderate company  KEEP AWAY!!!!!!
833|That's what Opus should do; shed her from their payroll.Threatening, unhelpful and has no grasp of customer care.  If Andy Nash (Opus Operations Manager)reads this comment, I would suggest that people of this ilk are one of the main reason's that you are receiving so many adverse comments about your company.I will be emailing you soon to explain in full
834|this company id the pitts they border on the fraudulent they had my supply because someone who did not have the lease in my property changed the supplier because of there reviews and what they wanted to charge i would not go with them trying to get away from them is a nightmare as none of them seem to know what the other ones in there company do i have a price quoted from scottish and southern 10.75 and what do they want 19.50 this has been going on for monrhs and what good are energywatch this watchdog is a toothless wonder i asume they are sudsidised by the energy companies because the seem inept to say the least if i had to avise anyone it would be dont dont dont go with this company tell all your fiends to avoid this company tell all there friends not to go with this company
835|well, well, well... all these complaints its a wonder you havent been investigated by watchdog...  i recently relocated to new premises and then was inundated with phone calls from electricity providers.. im trying to move and all these calls are really annoying until i got a so called independent business company telling me im on the wrong tariff and they can sort it out for us... he put it to me that they were a non profitable organisation so i gave the phone to my tech guy and he said their ok with the price they can get you.. turns out to be opus!!!!im part of a 6 unit compound and it turns out that im not in charge of electric and the cafe next door is. they refused opus and stayed with scottish power 6 WEEKS AGO..  so thats it?   no!!   this morning i notice GBP390.20 gone from my account... rings customer service and they dont have  us as customers and said they havent a clue whats going on can you send an email regarding this... why?luckily i check my bank online everyday because of previous cowboy company's so was able to call my bank manager and get her to recall it instantly and cancel a direct debit they had set up...where the hell did they get that amount from and how cheeky to take that after being refused... this company need seriously looking at....
836|Signed up for a years contract. They never sent the renewal letter to end the contract, then decided to sign me up for another year but with a 90% increase in the tariff.  Nasty company. Complaints department is even worse. Stay away from them!!!
837|i got a phone call from an opus worker ( calling from India) telling me he could reduce my bill. he promised me i would pay GBP125 per month for a 1year contract. I was really happy with this but was still very wary that this sounded to good to be true. realising i was going to deny his offer he then started to tell me not to worry as everything was being recorded,and this was  a verbal contract so without the recording would be void. i then told him i was in a contract with scottish power he said not to worry as HE would make sure this was terminated! once i agreed with him i got a welcome letter and awaited my bill. when i did get my bill it was for GBP183 for 10 days! i rang complained made a lot of noise but nobody was willing to listen! i then get another bill for GBP603 for a month! i rang again but all i was told was opus NEVER told me i would pay GBP125! i then requested a copy of my verbal contract, which i was told would take 2-3 working days it has been 15 working days since that but i still have not recieved. all i am getting is constant phone calls and requests for payment (i cancelled my direct debit!), i am still with opus but will be trying very hard to finally get rid of this cowboy company!    
838|This company are terrible and never to be used by anyone. After a year our contract expired and trying to get rid of them is a nightmare. They claim they have sent you a new contract giving you the time to terminate your existing agreement but this never happens. You then if not extremely careful fail to give them the desired notice and they then rip you off with much higher charges for the next year. Do not bother appealing to the electricity ombudsman because they are useless and no help at all. Do not use opus because it will end in tears.
839|was very reasonably happy with eon, was coming in the middle of the contract, i get a call from a indian broker saying they can save me money. i say that i am in a contract and they say that thats no problem they can get me out of it !!!   A few days later and i get a welcome letter to opus( never heard of them)... i ring to dispute and i say that i never agreed, they say yes i did. i ask them to send a verbal recording of me supposedley agreeing to the contract... i tell them this but their so call experts say that it is me!!!    eventually someone says i can leave them and find a new supplier but when i try and do that they block it and say that i cant as im in a contract.      its completeley clear theres fundamental dishonest practises amongst opus, the fact thay try and insult my intelligence by telling me that its my voice when its not!!!   my advice hang up the phone when you hear the name opus 
840|My name is Andrew, a new business owner on Eltham high street. Recently i received a call from someone claiming to be from business services.After much discussing he made me sign up with opus energy and a month later my problems started. I had a peaceful and non complicated life until i recently checked my account statement to find out that opus energy has billed me 187pounds per month based on assumption and when i called customer service  a lady promised to look into the issue and threatened that i will be cut off and never get another energy supplier if i decide to cancel my direct debit agreement with them.Now, the second month bill has come and they took out 190pounds, this is now getting me frustrated, this is a new business that is finding it hard to raise 300pounds monthly and i have to pay such amount for energy bills.I am convinced that i don't use that amount of energy, when i gave them a metre reading the lady i spoke with told me my bill should be higher based on the reading. There has to be a way of tackling this energy company, they can't sit in high places and frustrate growing businesses.My only option is the court but how do i proceed? can any one advise or help me. Opus energy is trying to close down a business that is barely three months in operation.Frustrated Andrew
841|One of the worst energy companies have ever dealt with. Pricing seems initially OK but soon escalates, and estimated meter readings are way out. The customer service person I spoke to claimed that it was a legal requirement to have the meter in full and open view (in a shop!) and that health & safety rules prevented the meter reader from opening a cupboard door to take a reading. If you have a dispute, expect a call from a mobile number from someone pretending to be a 'warrant officer' who has popped round to cut you off in order to frighten staff into paying. They are an absolutely despicable company - I wish I'd read the other reviews here before dealing with them. Needless to say we won't be renewing our contract. 
842|I own a small family business where every minute of every day counts. You have to rely on your suppliers to provide there commitments. I honestly spent more time managing this 'tin pot' outfit than actually getting service from them. Like most companies they are fine whilst they are taking the money, but wow are they incompetent when it comes to resolving issues. If you ask to speak to someone senior - forget it, they read from a script and state that someone will call back - which of course they don't. Never, ever, ever again, I'd rather generate it myself. By the way, its just as painful leaving them and switching to another supplier!!!! If you're thinking of Opus' smart meter, would advise against it - mine was/is constantly faulty and it cannot be read by other Electricity companies if you switch.
843|Like so many others writing reviews of Opus energy I am appalled at the massive rate hike from the end of my first 12 month contarct , an increase from 10p to 16p. They say they have written to me 3 times, I have received nothing, and now even though I have still got 5 weeks remaining I have been told that I am tied in to another 12 months at a 60% increase. I am aware now that this the terms state 90 adys notice or 30 from the renewal letter but having not received a renewal letter I decided to phone them only to be told too late!!!! Do not go with this company.
844|My husband got fooled from a consultant called Anil who works for this company, he approached my husband offering 50% off our bill.  This company only deals with business and we are a household, he cleaverly chaged the house title to tution centre, every month I got a bill of GBP800 which was 3 times more than I got from British gas, when we approached the consultant Anil he refuse to pay half of the bill, I then tried to change it back to bristling gas and opus would not allow us as they locked our account so that we cannot change.I will now be seeking legal advice and go to watch dog.I am very upset and angry for what they have done, I would never recommend this company to anyone.
845|I wish I'd read the reviews before going with this company.  They failed to set up my direct debit correctly, and have (are still!) hounding and threatening ME!  They are the WORST company I have ever dealt with.  Don't go near them.
846|the worst people i ever dealt with, customer service is rude and disrespectful. never ever go near to them
847|Not sure if this company is trying to rip me off or if they totally in incompetent. They keep try to invoice for the previous consumer's usage, who went bust and did a runner.I have been in contact with Opus numerous times, but they keep invoicing me for previous consumer. We will be changing supplier!      
848|These guys must have s..t for brains the customer service is crap  iv proberly rang them 4 times last year asking If I could change the direct debit date by 1 week they said yes I thought allrightNot a problem then on the original day the payment was due came out of my accountAnd I had 2 cheques going out and a direct debit going outI knew I was going to be shafted by the bank and the company whoI owed money to I rang them up and believe it or some girl called vicky Said I never rang into say I wanted to change the date I told her check your Records she rang me back saying we only have a conversion with you beforeNot the date in question, so I put the phone down got my bt bill as proof which had their phoneNumber and length of the conversation and gave it to my friend who is a solicitorAnd straight away they paid all the charges from the bank and the other businessesAnd paid me GBP700 for compensation and ended my contract early Just as long I didn't take them to court which I agreed.In a nutshell AVOID THEM and if you know your in the and have evidence (eg phone bill, recording of the call) get a good solicitor and letThem sought it out.
849|Shameful tactics by Opus Energy attempting to switch our energy supply from our existing supplier to Opus.On the first day of opening our business I was subjected to underhand tactics, lies and bullying in order to get an agreement to move to Opus energy. Thankfully they were unsuccessful in their attempts to switch us over as our existing supplier wouldn't play ball with them.I was called multiple times by them on our first day of trading. The people who called me were rude, deceitful and boorish, tormenting me with their continual harassment, to the extent that I was in tears. Their selection of such an opportune moment to attempt to forcefully bully someone into a verbal contract shows that they are not a pleasant firm to deal with. We have already relayed our feedback and concerns to their customer service department, but they really weren't interested and did everything they could to again convince me they were in the right and that we agreed to switch to them!Horrendous company.
850|They are the most unrespectful terrible enery supplier should not be allowed to operate.  As a business they send blue bills out for bill payment at the same time they send debt collecters letters and then phone four five times a day on the day the bill is due.  Be warned read other reviews what the other say is exactly how it is, overpriced fuel get you on verbal contracts, and they hassall you non stop, this should not be allowed, we are getting out of our contract this is less than six months with them, i would not be with them one day if i had read the reviews,,,, please do not use opus you will thank the other reviewers in the end.
851|I honestly don't understand how can a company like Opus Energy be operating in this country where we have laws, rules and regulations. Why watchdog and other company's who can do something are not doing anything.  I have been with this company for sometime and I can assure you no one in this entire country will help me get out of the problems I am going through with them.  I have tried calling everyone who could help me but the same answer from all is sort it out with Opus, this company have ruined my life as many other peoples lives and businesses so why will not any one do anything about it. The only thing left for me to do is get a lawyer or talk to my local M.P. It is disgraceful that a energy company can ruin your life and disgraceful that no one will help. If there is anyone who can help please say something here and i will write back. I urge to anyone who is reading this if you want a normal or a happy life stay away form Opus Energy if you ever find a representative tell him to go to HELL. There has to be someone who can help, please someone help help help.
852|In short these guys are horrendous they charged us for the wrong meter at two different sites we ran over a 5 month period we must have spent 20 hours on the phone trying to sort this out only to be told last week we are not under contract to them because the meter they have been charging us for is in a shop about 100 metres up the road not evan in the same street! despite them having our address all along and sending us bills there. Do not under any circumstances have anything to do with these people. The only good review here was probably written by themselves STAY CLEAR!!!
853|I am the owner of a commercial property which is rented out to two tenants. There is one landlord's electric supply contract for the site which is billed to each tenant via individual sub meters.On making contact with my contracted supplier recently I was astonished to be told that the supply had been switched to a new supplier, Opus Energy,  well before the end of the contract. I was further advised that I would be liable for an early redemption penalty charge.On enquiring with my tenants I was told that a sales rep had made contact but in no way was any contract entered into as they knew they could not do so. This resulted in a protracted correspondence with Opus who at every juncture were polite but totally unhelpful. They spoke about an unwritten contract with the tenant as recorded on their system. At one stage I was asked to produce a copy of my lease agreement with my tenant to prove that he was not authorised to enter into a contract. What a cheek. It was only when I phoned that I achieved some success. I had to speak very firmly. The so called contract was cancelled and returned back to my original contracted supplier. This is an appalling company engaging in very questionable practices. It doesn't actually make the initial sales call itself, this is carried out by an outfit named Active Energy Direct who then presumably sell the contract on. Any contract which is dependent upon a telephone discussion when unit rates, contract duration etc cancellation clauses etc must be treated with every suspicion.In conclusion I would add that the rates Opus Energy proposed to charge my tenant were considerably more than I charge my tenants. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. 
854|Do not involve you self or your company with Opus Energy.Poor Customer Service
855|Hi - I am sharing a terrible experience my partner has had with OPUS since she took ownership of the supply at a convenience store back in December 2010.  Apparently and unkown to us the previous owner was disconnected by OPUS in Novemeber 2010 and subsequently reconnected himself some days later.  OPUS discovered this quickly and escalated the matter (quite within their rights).  As I said, in December my partner took ownership of the property, notified OPUS and supplied them with meter readings.  An account was setup in her name and she has been paying by direct debit every since.  The property has remained empty and not trading since she took ownership - something OPUS were aware of.  In July 2011 OPUS forced entry to the property and removed the meter. Why? we are not sure and cannot get any reasonable explanation from them.  They never notified us of the previous tenants activities nor that there was ongoing action - they simply took our money.  They are now demanding over GBP400 to reconnect, asking for GBP1700+ in supply charges for an empty property and a GBP5000 bond.  They take weeks to answer emails and never answer the questions being asked, avoiding all difficult questions raised.  They refuse to acknowledge the obvious that the previous tenant was responsibile and not my partner but are simpy trying to get money from the easiest person.  It has taken 3 attempts to get escallation procedures from them which we will do and follow with legal action if needed.  AVOID OPUS AT ALL COSTS - they have no concept of fair play and are the worst company I have ever had to deal with.
856|I am currently in dispute with Opus as my power supplier has switched to Opus, when speaking to the broker, he had stated that he had spoken to my landlord, and that I will not be changing supplier just updating details on records, and that I need to understand all terms and conditions. They call you on your first day of trading at your busiest time, which to me owning a cafe was at lunch. In hindsight i should have said call back, but I was trying to get everything together as soon as possible. Anything that was said prior to recording is lost so they have you over a barrel. I am not the responsible person for my meter as I pay my landlord which we agreed at contract signing as the meters are shared with another business. I cant access meter as in the factory adjacent to me, and is a heavey metla firm and I am not covered by insurance to enter this area. I am being billed over 300% more for power than before, as I ma in dispute with Opus and they have only estimated, I have not paid and I have explained that what they are asking is more that I make so is not practical. I now have threats from debt collectors and disconnection of my poewr. My landlord is furious as he is in a contract with another firm and is facing a penalty by them because of this. Energy Ombudsman now involved as the customer services at Opus are not customer friendly. If this continues I will be bankrupt before I reach 6 months trading. I hope your happy Opus?Soon to be bankrupt..... 
857|We have had nothing but trouble with this company.  They took advantage of my father who is deaf and in his eighties, ended up paying for years for nothing, we had an empty shop that was never going to be used again.  You can never get them to understand an issue.  Sent a final meter reading 5 months ago.  Still getting monthly bills inspite of trying to explain my father no longer lives at the property and that it is being sold for residential use only.  It seems unless the person on the phone can tick a box they can not deal with your problem.  My advise is never use this company, my Father is not the only person to have experienced problems and bills that do not belong to them. A PERSON WHO CAN MAKE DECEICIONS OTHER THAN TICKING BOXES WOULD MAKE LIFE EASIER FROM THEM AND THE CUSTOMER.  THEY ARE A NIGHTMARE stay away from this company.
858|Today i got a contract with npower through a service that find you the cheapest for what you want (i dont remeber the name) After ending our conversation within 10 mins i recieved another call from a man that was cutrious of who i had for my energy supplier so without thinking i told him npower without explaining why he wanted to no or telling who he was he just hung up... a short while later i revied another call from a man and he quoted everything i had said in my preivious phone call to the man that called and he said he was from npower but he sounded really familiar he said i had to call opus because they had deenergized somthing and i couldnt go with any other suplier so i hung up and called the number he gave me straig awayhad i plan on opening on saturday and need electricy asap! when the man answered i new he sounded familer because it was the man that caLLED TO ASK WHO I WAS WITH AND HE WAS THE ERXACT SAME VOICE I HAD HEARD FROM 
859|I have been with OPUS ENERGY a year and am unfortunately tied into a 2 year contract.  They underestimated my small business electricity bill by GBP2000 despite taking regular meter readings.  They then tried to take the full amount by Direct Debit and sent bailiffs to my shop demanding payment in full.  The eventually set up a payment plan which they later cancelled and demanded the amount in full again.I had to pay them GBP1400 in full!I strongly discourage anyone to use them as a supplier.  The business next door to me also uses them and has had the exact same problem!  Their Customer Service staff are rude and aggressive and have no intention of helping to resolve complaints.I wish I had looked into Opus Energy before signing up with them as I notice that there a few companies with a good word to say about them.  If I had read these reviews I would have known not to join them!
860|I've been a customer of Opus for almost 5 years and I have to say that any time I have had an issue, I've only had to make a call to them and everything has been sorted.  My monthly bills reflect what I use and being on fixed rates only benefits me and my business.  I always get calls from other competitors trying to sign me up but I have no desire to move away.I'd really encourage customers to make contact if you have a problem - I'd be really suprised if they didn't want to help you.
861|was with opus for 4yrs they told me i had verbal contract what rubbish only was with them as previous owner was.  nothing but hasle from day one now with eon yesssssssssss
862|please please please DO NOT SIGN UP WITH OPUS ENERGY. This company needs to be reigned in by a protective body, my son has just opened a pet shop, and after telling our broker to find us a new supplier, we settled on scottish power as their rates were the cheapest there was. Scottish power dragged their heels a bit and the sharks that Opus are phoned my son and pestered him all morning to sign up with them. With him being new to business i told him to send all calls to me. They kept refusing, and when they finally buckled and had to speak to me they phoned me up and gave me the prices. They were very acceptable so i phoned my son back and told him that it was ok to sign up with them. They consequently phoned him  back and gave him different prices when he agreed to a verbal contract. We only knew about this when they sent us details of the contract. When i tackled them about this they said they could only send a recording of the verbal contract with my son and not the one with me, HOW CONVENIENT! They eventually gave us a tiny reduction in the price which we still have not received notification of, just a letter saying sorry and a charter for complaints which wasn't in the letter, HOW CONVENIENT! I am setting up a campaign to make sure small business or any business for that matter doesn't sign up with these liars. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT SIGN UP WITH OPUS ENERGY, THEY WILL FLEECE YOU, if they offered me electricity half the price of every other company i would never renew with them, can't wait for the contract to end so i can tell them where to go.
863|My wife was misled into a contract with these cowboys last August.  The figures speak for themselves.  12 months electricity with EDF was GBP2251.62 So far for Opus since last November over GBP4300 thats for just 7 months.  They will treat you like a mug and will explain nothing in plain English.  I find them evil and inhumane in there approach to customer service.  You will only ever get to speak to a junior member of staff on the phone who sit there calmly as you heart races and blood boils as they must be resilient to all the complaints they handle every day.  They clearly breech there contracts with not delivering there promises, but when you try and get out of the contract they cant help you. I asked for a recording of my wifes conversation with the theifs who sold us the opus package and get this.  They sent us a CD of someone else, a hairdressing salon in Bedfordshire about 400 miles away from us.  So I got a CD with someone giving their full name, address, date of birth bank account details and sort code.  Hows that for data protection, makes you think about who my information has been shared with.  Anyone who has had the misfortune to deal with this company should do this in my opinion.  Join the federation of small businesses and your own professional body for example the federation of fish friers if you have a chip shop, or national federation of hairdressers if you have a hairdressing business.  Please inform your own professional body of opus energy and there working practices, then ask them to warn all there members not to enter into any contract with Opus under any circumstances.  Hopefully Opus will get the message and stop bullying small businesses.
864|I've started a new business and I was rang by these people telling me I was on an off contract charge system and it was costing me a fortune (turned out to be a lie) that they were the cheapest supplier (another lie) and that I was responsible for the electricity ( I wasn't)They started a recording taking details and I asked if there was a cooling down period, they told me there was. I then spoke to my new landlord who informed me he has a contract already and that I wasn't responsible at all. So I rang back and explained the situation within 24 hours and they said the agreement was cancelled, I asked for that in writing and they said because I had contacted them so quickly it wouldn't even be processed so I wouldn't hear anything else.10 days later I get a contract through the post, I rang Opus and went through the whole story again, they kept me on hold for ages and then said their objection Department was busy and would call me back today, they didn't. I rang again the next morning at 8am when they open and they told me that there was in fact no cooling down period at all and they would get back to me, they haven't.It's all getting very stressful as your trying to start a new business, anyone have any advice?
865|I run a small hotel and like one of the previous reviews I had enough on my plate starting up and signed a 4 year contract with Opus, unwittingly.  Their prices are horrendous and my electricity  bills are between GBP500 - GBP700 per month.  We only have a bar and three letting rooms.  They put a smart meter in my premises which I can't read, so therefore have no idea if I am being charged correctly or not.  Like other customers I phoned them about the rates I am being charged, and was told there was nothing I could do, and they would not allow me to terminate the contract.  I then spoke to my solicitor who reviewed my contract terms, and he informed me that I am stuck in the contract until 2012.  Went onto the Ofgem site, then found that they don't actually have a say in what people are charged and you cannot contact them, they tell you to go to your supplier, what good are they if they can't help the consumer? 
866|i just took contract with opus energy few month ago.they have put me in so stressfull.after the bill arrived 1 day .next day i get another bill say this is final demand and alot of phone call at least 4 time a day.i ask them i would like to leave opus energy because the way opus energy treat customer ,i feel it is awfull and all the letter seem they are very angry and rude. event your bill are not due yet.they said i can not leave them.i have contract with other company before i never have the daily problem like this.i really really want to get out of them.and use the supplier like EDF/ukpower.i feel very sorry that i thougth every one will be the same.
867|hello,    I recently started a new business venture 2 months ago and took over an existing premises.  With enough to be getting on with I left my gas and electric as the current suppliers with a view to shopping around for the best quote in a month's time - I knew both suppliers  but was busy setting up a small business so I put it off on day 1 - in hindsight this was a mistake.    The next thing I knew 3 weeks into our business I got a call from Opus Energy stating that they were now my Electric and Gas supplier for my property and had me tied into a contract for 2 years.  I had never heard of them before and they said they had a verbal contract from someone on the premises.  A quick google search and it seems I am not alone.    The person who they caught out with the verbal contract is my partner and yes legally she does have authority to speak for our company - but she is not from the UK and her English is not great.  I am still awaiting a recording of the contract from Opus but this has been delayed in coming through ??? As a result Opus have our wrong company name and my partners wrong personal name on all our contracts. My partner does not remember the call, has never heard of Opus and runs our busy front of shop so diverts all business related calls to myself as she deals with customers.    Opus have managed to take the electricity supply and now billing me at over 33% above the best rate I since got quoted through 'GoCompare'.  They also have now sent me a electricity contract in the post with all the details and all their T&C;'s for a 2 year contract at this rate !!! With significant penalty fees for early cancellation - I said I was not happy about how they obtained the contract, raised a formal complaint and asked for a recording of the verbal contract which they have sent out to me but I have not received yet.  I was offered a price reduction in my rates following my complaint - but I have said I would like to hear the recording of the verbal contract first.    They also are now taking the invoice on an estimate basis charge from my bank account and have all my direct debit details.  My business has been open 2 months and the only company I gave my bank details to are my existing gas supplier.  However, a few weeks down the line my original gas supplier does not have my details as I have to by my 1st month by debit card, but low and behold Opus are already diving into my bank account !!!      I don't want to say to much more as this is still ongoing, and my gas supply is also up in the air.  Opus are trying to tie me into their 2 year contract again for gas at a rate that is actually DOUBLE !!! what my existing suppliers are quoting me.    My current postion is I don't want to be tied into Opus for anything ( even more so now out of principal as I find their business conduct absolutely disgusting !! ) never mind 2 years at inflated rates !! - however, they do have my electricity supply and am worried they effectivley have me by the balls as obviosuly I need electricity to run my business.    I have 2 jobs and work in 2 very different industries - in both of these industries 'customer service' is paramount !!! I have come across companies that aren't very good, companies that have made mistakes but this is the first time I have come across a company that I find to be intentionally malicious.  I know these companies exist and are out there but I have been fortunate or able to avoid them till now.  We will wait and see how this pans out and if anyone has any advice or similar experience or advice of how to get rid of Opus then please let me know.   
868|I took out a contract with OPUS ENERGY(business) I had a computer shop. When the recession hit I had to downsize and work from home. I informed OPUS of this and tried to get out of the contract after all I would be paying 17.5% VAT instead of the lower domestic rate. They told me they needed at least three months notice on cancellation and the contract was for 18 months and I was only into about 1 month of it.My partner who owns the house and pays the bills was in dispute with them about the VAT and the contract, when we tried to switch over to a new energy provider using USWITCH, OPUS blocked it and started adding costs onto the BILL.  At the end of all this we owe them over GBP900 they have a court order to install a meter into our domestic residence which is set at GBP150 a week minimum and we havent got that sort of money.Because it was a BUSINESS account we are not protected by comsumer laws that apply to domestic utilities suppliers.Looks like we will be sitting in the dark before too long, no fridge, no washer, no TV, etc. And a two year old child.  A cautionary tale. DONT TAKE OUT A BUSINESS TARIF NO MATTER HOW LOW THE UNITS COST AS YOU WILL PAY THE HIGHER RATE OF VAT AND ARE NOT COVERED BY CONSUMER PROTECTION.  AND DONT SIGN UP WITH OPUS AS YOU WILL PROBABLY NEVER GET OUT OF THE CONTRACT. AND YOU WILL LEFT IN THE DARK!!  
869|Having paid Southern electric monthly for my gas for the last 7 years, I was shocked to discover I had a bill for GBP1800 outstanding when I moved house. Closer inspection of bills showed that, according to the meter, my gas consumption had increased by 5 times over the last year - physically impossible you would think. Maybe a faulty meter? No - they will not check it as we do not live there any more. Do the new owners use Southern Electric? Yes. Will they contact them? No. I now need to contact our buyers to ensure that they are not ripped off like we have been.
870|I was given an estimate for bills which persuaded me to sign up. I had 3 visits from SE to check the meter with one of those visits supposedly to make my bills even cheaper based on my usage.3 months later my bill was over GBP200 and they said my whole time with them had been undercharged. They had also told me various lies over the phone which led me to ask for the telephone recordings. It took them months to process the request for the outcome 'they've now been deleted'. I have refused to pay and told them to take me to court but they've persisted in sending countless threats in writing and phone calls which resulted in me being forced to change my number. Beware of them.
871|I have been a customer of SSE for over 8 years and I have noticed their customer service that was the best is now poor. As I had found a much cheaper deal I decided to leave them. When I rang them to give my final readings the other day, the woman was more interested in selling me broadband. She didn't bother to ask why I was leaving.  Despite telling her I could not be reached by phone, I had a missed call from them. I can only guess this phone call was prompted by me cancelling my direct debits. As I am now with another company and I have already paid SSE in full, I certainly wasn't going to leave these direct debits active and continue paying SSE for energy that I do not owe. They can always write if they have a problem. SSe have become expensive compared to the smaller providers, and they won't pass on the drop in gas prices to to their customers. I have voted with my feet and switched. Although I doubt I will be missed.
872|been customer for 4 years but since last year they are charging me so high.every 3 months i kept having problem with my payment.they kept on increasing my direct debit without warning even though i said them i will pay at the end of the year wholesome money whatever i have owed them.every time i call them customer service staff said different things and got me very confused.now i changed my provider the final and bill came up to GBP413 even though i manage my account before i moved on.they have ripped me off totally.they have so many excuses and the way they handle customer service is so ridiculous.its been very stressful.i really warn u all not to use this provider at all.
873|"After death of my mother I had an absolutely dreadful experience trying to sort out continuing electricity supply to her house with Southern Electric.  43 minutes on the phone trying to simply change over to my name/details as Executor, in the interim, before house is sold. Their customer service is poor.  Typically ""reading from a script"", The operator asked me 4 times to confirm my name during the exasperating conversation, not to mention all the other stuff they had to read through, repeat, repeat etc etc.  No wonder they take so long to answer their calls, if each operator is on the phone for 40+ minutes. If you are feeling bereaved, don't call them until you feel better!  I had to go for a stiff drink afterwards, as so fuming and angry.I will definitely NEVER use this company again."
874|Good luck in getting anyone on the phone as the number is constantly engaged or no one answers! and this is the line to pay your bill!!!!! Time to change supplier for me.
875|This is probably the worst energy supplier in England. Customer service is so rude that is unbelievable. I was trying to pay a bill and had to phone 4 times, every time waiting on the line for over 15 minutes to be answered by a rude person. Awful, avoid!
876|near impossible to access online billing, site is a pile of Poo.Instant chat has a wait of 25 mins! And then booted out due to activity. Don't even bother trying to phone them they never answer. Am leaving after they put direct debit and prices up with no warning.Almost as bad as EDF!!!!!
877|DONT USE THIS COMPANY!! TERRIBLE!!! WAS INITALLY PAYING 80 POUNDS DIRECT DEBIT AND THEY INCREASE IT TO 142 WITHOUT ANY WARNING!! 
878|Took hours to get an answer on phone , after several long calls waiting. I received a plan and stuck to it. Two days later no electric again. More phone calls and more money wasted to be told the first person I spoke to had got my plan wrong. Cost me another GBP60.00 to be reconnected.Disgusted.
879|Why does it take these numpties 3 hours to answer the phone?
880|I was made to feel awful for asking her to explain some of the jargon to me and go in to a bit more detail to explain the tariffs. I'd been on hold for so long and I only have a a few hours to sort this so didn't think asking questions would be a problem. She may be familiar with her script but I am not. I've been left on hold for 1 hour 3 minutes and counting......,I'll await the documents.
881|"Poor, pricing, no compromise. Calls cast 10p per minute and it takes them almost half an hour every time to ""connect me to an adviser"" upon which it seems i have been transferred to someone with the intelligence little above that of a chimp. It is theorised that a monkey after a while would type the entire works of shakespeare which seems to be a damn sight more likely than someone picking up the phone and actually being capable to sort any problem. I mean seriusly, where do they find these people? "
882|Today a meter reader arrived and told me he had a right to come into my home and read my meter.I told him he couldn't because my cupboard was full. He then told me that it was the law that he could come in and I told him this was incorrect. He said that he knew I was lying and told me i'd be getting a bill for thousands. I live in a semi detached private home and I'm stunned by his attitude. I called to complain and this took an hour. The meter reader almost tried to push past me but I stood in his way and told him to leave my drive. He shouted 'i'll be back tomorrow'.I don't know what kind of commission or targets these people have, but this situation is a first for me.
883|We needed to call as we had no electric when we woke up this morning.  Was slightly annoyed that there was an automated message with areas with faults that didn't have our area.  Pressed the button to speak to someon and got through very quickly.  Called the them from my mobile (with not much battery), they said they would call back soon with a time the engineer would be out, and I explained my battery was low on my phone.  They said they would text instead.  When the power came back on a short while later, I phoned them back to say we no longer needed an engineer, and they were very good with advice on checking for shorts, and other possible problems.  
884|I recently moved into a property using Southern electric. When I moved in, it took over two months to get in touch with Southern electric to set up my account, despite constant assurances that they would ring or email me back. In the mean time I kept getting increasingly large and threatening bills from them and claims that I owed them money from the previous tenants.Once I finally managed to set up an account, it took a further month and constant calls to set up any kind of payment method, which they promptly forgot to then send me bills about. I tried contacting them only to eventually find out that they had cancelled my paper bills but forgotten to confirm my online account, meaning that I now owed them a lot of money without knowing - a fact that only became clear when I got fed up and tried to change account only to find out that they were refusing to release me.Unfortunately, the stress didn't end there as two weeks after having started with my new supplier I received another email saying that I still owed Southern electric over GBP200. I rang them up to hear that this was the closing balance based on the meter reading given by my new supplier, far higher than my actual one. A reading that, after more phone calls, I find out was not only not sent by my new supplier but that had been generated by Southern electric without any consultation. They advised me to wait a few days and ring back to see if Southern electric would get in touch with them or else they would dispute it for me but what a hassle!

887|Moved into a rental property and decided to go with Npower. Three months in and receive a letter from Npower saying I need to contact Southern Electric as they have rejected them letting us change. Contacted Southern Electric and was told that the previous guy moved out which is fine but no-one told them who was moving in yet they had the agents detail on file. So instead of contacting the agents or US who now live at the property within this three month period they just decided to keep billing the property, to who they are billing I don't know but now it is my bill. The gentlemen on the phone was trying to use NLP techniques on me which I did not appreciate and he did not realise that what he was explaining in his terms as my fault was actually their lack of communication. I also had to wait 25 minutes for someone to answer the line. Utterly ridiculous!
888|Everything about this company is rubbish

891|"4 TIMES, over 2 days my pre-paid meter has shut down - ""no gas, call help""each time, i have to wait 4 hours for it to be reset. at 2.30am I have to wait between 8 and 12 tomorrow ?  whats with that?  i moved here and it was already installed, but I have not got good credit so can't get it changed, which is ridiculous because I've never failed to pay an energy bill. My previous address I had a pre-pay 17 years never a fault, that however was british gas,  although it was inconvenient I didn't like the idea of having to pay a huge deposit they hold for a year! just because I have a bad credit history.  I don't actually have ANY CREDIT, but that's bad apparently.if the meter is faulty surely they should waiver the GBP52 cost.  I don't owe them any money, my prepay has a lot of cash on (pre-paid) enough for my useage for next pay day, but I can't use it. I don't have a spare 52.00 like many I am on a low income - but seems just because I am on a low income and choose not to have things on credit, I am being held to ransom, with NO CHOICE.  If I'm paying 40 a month prepaid and I use less than the value of that, how is that different from paying 40.00 direct debit..  makes no sense, Southern electric are rip off merchants.   Bottom line is if your one of millions of low paid forget it, you get no help."
892|TeilenSouthern ElectricWARNING !! use SSE at your OWN RISK !! - Southern Electric Utility ServiceNewest Review: ... had been taking *actual* meter readings at my house, that they had been estimating the bills for the last year and a half, and now they ... moreOverviewRead 10 ReviewsWrite a ReviewWARNING !! use SSE at your OWN RISK !!Southern ElectricProduct:Southern ElectricDate: 03/04/13Rating:Advantages: CheapDisadvantages: definately *not* cheerfulRecently, SSE walloped me with a massively inflated bill . Having been with them for almost 2 years i was shocked. I had always paid my bills on time and in full, and the bills were based upon meter readings that THEY (or their agents) had taken at my house.It transpires that even though they had been taking *actual* meter readings at my house, that they had been estimating the bills for the last year and a half, and now they were insisting that i clear off the whole debt. I found their attitude to be helpful at times but in the main they seemed not to be interested in what i thought were fair proposals to clear the outstanding debt (which in fairness was due to their incompetence)i want to clear the balance, but they insist that i do it to their chosen timetable and methods.They are utterly inflexible in their stance and regularly threaten me with court action via post.I would ONLY ever recommend SSE to a sworn enemy of mine, purely because i feel that only SSE would be able to reek the kind of vengeance upon someone, that i could only dream about.They appear to be money grabbing incompetent fools who have little concern for their own shortcomings and seem to be only interested in inflicting as much pain upon their customers as possible, while charging them for the privilege.Horrid, horrid, horrid.My advice? pay a little more to a different supplier, and at least get treated as a human being.Summary: AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
893|I have been using southern electric now for many years first at my last house for over 10 years and then at my house that I moved in to a year ago. They are easy enough to contact and will adjust any estimated bills when needed. But they are not the cheapest which is a shame, hence only 4 stars.
894|Over 20 years with the Southern Electric, on an incentivised online billing and direct debit tariff of 7% discount, I received notice that the tariff I was on was changing on October 15th, giving a measly GBP20 a year discount rather than 7%. My bills are high so this meant a vast increase. I phoned to ask whether I could be transferred to a better tariff. The answer was no, so I decided to switch. I was GBP500 in credit at the end of the month before the switch so I phoned on October 17th, when I'd made my final meter reading to ask when my refund would be paid. A very helpful call centre operator suggested that, as I was so much in credit, she should cancel my direct debit to save me being even further in credit. How kind I thought, but, when the final bill arrived, the 7% discount that should have been applied until 15th October, was not! Several very long phone calls ensued and I was gradually escalated to a more senior person. Eventually, after much wrangling, the refund was properly made, but I felt they were trying to punish me for moving my account. When the contract with my new supplier ends at the end of this year I shall not be returning to Southern Electric!
895|We have been with SE for gas & electric for over 2 years. We switched to them the day we moved into our new property, and within a week they had been out and installed a new meter as the previous one was an economy 7 meter. Our gas payment has risen by only GBP2 per month over 2 years and electricity has fallen by GBP10 over the same period. We are also always in credit. We use their new Iplan monitor for electricity, which is very helpful in managing your usage. It did break once but I was sent a replacement within a month. The call centre staff have always been very polite and knowledgeable when I have had to contact them. They may not be the cheapest on the market but you get what you pay for! I will be staying with this company and would always recommend them to a friend.
896|I have been with Southern Electric for many years. I have a dual fuel account, pay monthly by direct debit and have paperless bills. I have storage heaters and a gas fire which are obviously only used during the winter months. Until recently I was happy, I made sure that I submitted accurate readings and increased my monthly payments when I felt that the increase was needed. Obviously my bills are higher during the winter but by paying the same amount through the summer this evened out. In April my direct debit for electricity was increased by GBP9 per month. I had not been informed in advance but with price increases expected I left it as it was. On 26th September I was prompted, online, to submit my readings and did so. On 5th October I received a letter informing me that my dd was being increases by GBP28 per month which would be reviewed again at my annual review in April 2012(not a mistake). As my new bill was not showing online, I called customer services to find out how much I owed. I am, in fact, in credit!! When I asked that my dd stayed as it was I was told that it would not cover my usage for the winter. I know that, but it more than covers my summer usage leaving me in credit!!! When I explained that I had always received good customer service in the past and was managing my accounts by speaking to them regularly I was told that they had been too lenient in the past and that I would have to increase the dd by GBP28 per month because I should be in credit going into the next quarter. I am in credit!! I was also told that my annual review is in January and not April. After asking to speak to a manager and threatening to switch providers I was put on hold. Eventually the same person returned and told me that his manager had agreed that my dd would not be increased now but could be at my review in January. I am a 63 and a widow. I am still working and pay most bills monthly by dd as it makes it easier to budget. GBP28 per month is a huge amount to me especially when I don't owe anything. Why should my money be earning interest for SE? I will have to cut back to avoid this increase so it's going to be a cold winter.
897|I am having trouble with is company. it first started with the electric. i currently have an old meter, i requested a new one but if i did have a new one installed then i would be accepting the current electric charges.so they offered me a meter check which i agreed because i believe i was being charged at least double compared to family and friends.four days later after i sent an email of complaint, the woman told me if they found nothing wrong with the meter (from ofgem) then i would be charged GBP70. Funny the MANAGER i spoke to never mentioned this.I would check my account online and it jumped to GBP1600? so i was like what is going off? she came back with some weird excuss and my account had been credited over GBP800?I then started to take my own meter readings, all the time i am in constant communication with them, they just keep fobbing me off.next i requested a electric monitor (which i should have been offered obviously) the readings were showing at least half of what the main meter was reading. surely that is enough proof?again didn't want to know, she keeps saying its under investigation and have to wait another week. in the meantime they want GBP107 off me per month.And don't even get me started on the gas. I pay GBP39pm, i have not used gas in about 4 months. so here's me thinking im in credit, no im GBP83 in debt WHAT?again under investigation, have to wait another week and they have decided to put up my monthly direct debit by GBP6.I am currently seeking help from the ombudsman. then the next step is going to be threatening them with watch dog!AVOID SOUTHERN ELECTRIC!
898|The price was fine but I got a better deal from British Gas. Unfortunately changing over was a complete nightmare and SE kept charging me monthly bills three months after I had changed over, on calling up I was told this was because my meter reading had given me a bill of over GBP5,000 and that they would keep charging me, they said this was obviously a mistake but why did they not contact me about it? I then had some emails which were not informative and were unhelpful and some phone calls from a very rude woman who kept calling quite late in the evening. overall very unimpressed and will never use SE again or recommend to a friend.
899|we are with SSE for a year,we changed as our previous supplier was putting the price up and SE had better deal on that time but that's it.After that is always problem with even leaving the meter reading online and on the phone as some how account is not recoginsed!!!Direct debit has been increased  twice the amount without any notice,just what I found was an information on last online bill that it will go up.I would like to know that I will pay more at least be contacted  by email.I tried several times to contact customer service but no answer by the way there is always problem with contacting them.I'm annoyed,with the way how they treat own customer,NOT RECOMENDED!!!
900|I've been with them for 8yrs, and i've never had a problem with them, always been very helpful, plus i'm in credit with them and i have been for last few yrs GBP200 and GBP400 because i pay more each month then i should, but its pays for birthdays and xmas!When i first went with them i was finding it hard t pay my bills and got in to a bit of debt witht them but my sister phoned them up for me and sorted it all out and i paid them off monthly and they where hapy with!Each month i give thema meter reading and its tells me how much i have used so i know if i have used to much!
901|Since day 1 of signing up with Southern Electric we experienced nothing but problems.  Rude members of telephone staff. Delay in set up. No paperwork. Letters every month stating that they ARE increasing direct debit and NOT asking.  When challenging this, could make it lower but did so huffing and puffing! Adding on cancellation fees whenever they feel like it.  Weeks to respond to communications.  Even if these were the lowest priced Company, I would not use them again or recommend them.  Please even for GBP10 a month saving on your Gas 
902|Currently not happy with there idea of customer help. Took me 2 days of arguing to pay the bill in the end they all seem to get what they want. One pigeon hole to fit all circumstances. So after they put in a pre-paid meter without making any real effort to tell us I paid them off in full even money I didn't owe. then they told me it was another GBP52 to get the meter changed back, after a few minutes found a supplier that was actually cheaper on pre-pay than they were on a monthly bill. Just  that now they took my choice away to find anything even cheaper. Also got to grudgingly give them 5 more weeks of my hard earned money, before I can change. I can't say I hold out much hope for them reducing the GBP1.73 per a unit even though I just paid them in full this morning.  
903|I recently was talked into switching providers by a doorstep salesman from eon he promised me the earth and nothing came of it i have a 3 bed semi he told me GBP55 would cover both my fuels and foolishly i believed him after switching i recieved a call from southern electric a helpful lady called Stacey had a long chat with me it was a sales call but she was not pushy or rude in fact she was very helpful and explained alot of things i did not understand about energy and billing i did not agree to go back that day i asked Stacey to call me after i recieved my first bill from EON and all she told me was true i had in fact gone to a provider who set my direct debits to low and if i had contiued would see myself in debt when Stacey called back as i requested later that month i quickly went back to southern electric 
904|Do NOT recommend Southern Electric poor customer service,unhelpful & rude they try and make you pay other people's debts for Gas & Electricity used they are money grabbers from hell.  They overcharge for Gas & Electricity appalling service so be warned.
905|I changed suppliers from EDF to Southern when I moved into a new rental flat. The letting agency had a deal that should see us save 6% a year. Considering the flat has storage heaters every discount was welcome!   So far so good. The last bill was pretty much what I was expecting as we had a longer winter but now the storage heaters have been off for a few months I'm hoping the next bill will be cheaper. The only problem I have had so far is a lack of a key to the meter meaning I could not update my readings online and risked getting an estimated bill. I wrote an email to Southern and got a reply after a week apologising for the delay in responding and they advised me they had posted out a replacement key so I could take the reading.  Great customer service as I hate estimated bills and I am satisfied by the response.
906|"I recently worked for the company southern electric as a stop gap and I witnessed some dodgy things. I was shown the ways in doorstep selling. Which I hated and to be honest told potential customers not to bother as southern electric are not cheaper than all the other companies on everything!!! maybe on the odd bit but we're talking pence!!! Most of the salesman lie through their teeth but its the same with all the energy companies if someone approaches you at your home to ""save you money"" look at the comparison with the salesman make sure it is correct and they are doing a comparison based on your current payment methods e.g. monthly direct debit to monthly direct debit most salesman are using quarterly payment to monthly direct debit which shows a huge saving to you the customer but really your payments could be a couple pound a month more! If they come to your house just tell them that you rent and your bills are covered by in your rent and they wont want to know you.  "
907|SHOCKING! I own a 3 bed semi and have both my gas and electric supplied by Southern Electric. I pay GBP65 per month for gas alone (GBP55 for electric) imagine my horror when I received a bill for a further GBP370 making my monthly payment GBP122 per month - TOTAL JOKE AND RIP OFF
908|This company employ extremely dodgy salesman carrying out cold calling in Oxfordshire. They make out that they are officials from the electricity board who have spotted a problem with meter readings on the meter they 'own'. They claim that customers using other providers have been over charged and should switch to their company. Very misleading, especially for the elderly and vunerable.
909|They are an extremely poor company to deal with.I have been a customer for a while and have been alerted by another source that tvs watchdog have been investigating s/e for miselling /electricty prices to customers.You will find  this report at http://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/watchdog-accuses-electricity-firm-of-misselling-572166.html.....Personally i have discovered they had been over-charging me for a while actually been doingme outofmoney for 3 yrs and now i ahve found out they are panicking.. they keep from customers a special online reduction of up 10% if customers volunteer to send their meter readings every quarter by email,they have a wesite set up for this but dont tell you, and customers can view their bill online for no extra charge they get a 10% reduction on their gas prices.Standard is 3.15 quarterly without vat and online your rate qould be 3.10, with your redcution becuz you offer to send them a meter reading s/e have expressed that they are not allowed to tell customers about special offers or sign them up over the phone for any products gas/electricity (baring in mind contracts are set up verbally?but techically they are not supposed to sign up anyone over the phone as then quoted by southern electric)but were happy  for me to sign up  for other products therem and then. Ufortunately after being their customers for a while i can say they are not the most honest or trustworthy,owell-mannered people to deal with and the fact they try to convince custmors they cannot get their gas/electrcity even 1% cheaper with them or anyone else and they are hiding this online billing facility so that they can get more money out of people is shocking.I have a regular review of my account and billing to discuss if s/e can offer me anything to lower prices..all the time they have expressed their prices are the same as most other companies and there isnt any possible way customers can recieve discounts...i found out by accident that they can they just dont tell you because they make that extra 10% out of you and of course recive a profit from that extra 10%.I would say BE WARNED....they are a really untrustworthy company who are not upfront and will if they can get as much money out of you can.Plz also be aware the they in some cases will try to put more money onto your bill..and its very difficult to get them to explain what the extra charges are for, dont allow them to bully threaten you, which they will try into making you pay for someting they cant tell you is..they are the worse and most dishonest company ive ever had dealings with and they are not going to give you the best deal or abide by the present laws on selling products and advertising they are not the cheapest and they have done me out if money they are admitting they should not have kept from me the info about their cheaper tariff online..an maybe they just forgot to tell me?RIGHT?.but now the attitude is we've done it and its to late..apparently they are gona try and find out what when wrong and offered me the 10% reduction if i signed up for it when it should have been offered to  me over a year ago or more.(had expressed a manager should have told me in my regular reviews but for some reason withheld this info s/ecant understand why?) ..and they are not really supposed to  sign anyone up on the phone for anything product like that! I ALSO HAD TO GIVE THEM A RATING OR I COULD NOT POST THIS PLZ BE AWARE MY RATING WOULD NOT EVEN BE ONE STAR THEY ARE THAT BAD.
910|i was about to join when i got a postcard through door asking to ring needing to complete before they could prcess my application so rang and they said they did point scoring and i didnt score correctly and they wanted to guarentee i made my payments i would have to pay GBP150 deposit to go through with my application which would be refunded after a year oh yes of course i am not going to do that how annoying and funny currently paying over GBP100 a month to current supplier and they worried i couldnt pay GBP60 per month so funny dont knock on my door again waste of my time   
911|Been a cus for a while and they try to con money out of you, send requests for bills already paid with amounts with no breakdown,refuse to answer direct questions and are unable to explain what unexplained amounts are,argumentative..rude,unorganised,do not have mathamatical skills...and are unco-operative,WARNING:PLZ DONT GET PHONE WITH THEM THEY WILL BILL YOU FOR CALLS YOU HAVE NOT MADE WILL REFUSE EXPLANTION,ARE AGRESSIVE,AND BACK-TRACK,AND YES,THEY LIE!..I HAVE AUDIOS SPANNING 6 MONTHS AND NOW ARE IN A POSITION TO HAND IT OVER TO WATCHDOG WITH MY PROOF.PLZ DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPNAY YOUR CARD OR DIRECT DEBIT DETAILS THEY WILL COMMIT FRAUD IF YOU DONT PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN,WARM THEM U ARE GOING TO W/D THEY WILL CO-OPERATE THEN!
912|I have had pretty good service from Southern Electric. The staff are always friendly, although it can take a while to get thorugh to them, on average, 20 mins but they are all very accomodating.   I was looking to switch to see if I could save money but after reading some of the reviews, I think I'll stick with them as I had trouble with BT for the previous tenants arrears that I was forced to pay and loads of trouble with Npower who, among other things hiked my bills right up and still owe me money after 3 years. I would definitely recommend them on their customer service but like us all, would like to get cheaper fuel bills.
913|I have been with Southern Electric (both gas and electricity) for 5 years and during that time have moved house with them.  The move itself was dealt with efficiently.  In the last year however they significantly increased my payments from GBP25 to GBP62 for gas and from GBP15 to GBP24 for electricity - with no explanation.  When I called to complain, they refused to adjust it.  I've tried to give them meter readings but they do not register them and say their systems have been down when I call to find out why.  I have just had a meter reading done and I'm in credit by GBP286 but they still refuse to take the payments down.  I'm now changing my provider.
914|We have been with Southern Electric for two years for both gas and electricity and have had no problems with them. There was a fault with the gas supply on our road last winter.  I called the helpline, the call was answered immediately, an engineer was out within half hour...Meanwhile my neighbours were still trying get hold of their suppliers (one being British Gas, the other I'm not sure of). Every person we dealt with were not just helpful but extremely friendly too! Much as paying high cost of utilities upsets me I do have to say Southern Electric gets my vote! Highly recommended.
915|Absoulte joke company - a massive con - dont even bother ringing customer services no one know what they are doing.
916|They send me bills for amount that not exist ,estimated bills are way to high, don't answered to questions, trying to get as much money as they can- making a fool from you...
917|This is really confusing. I don't know who supplies my energy. Is Scottish Power the same company as Southern Electric, yes I think it is because Southern Electric is a subsidiary of the Scottish and Southern Energy Group. Now this is where things get complex because I am actually with EBICO so I am not sure who my complaint is with.  EBICO is really cheap but they outsource their customer services to Southern Electric, which is part of Scottish and Southern Energy Group and customer services at Southern Electric are absolutely atrocious. The savings made with EBICO are offset by the worst customer service you can possibly imagine. Before I made my purchase I would have liked to know how rubbish Southern Electric are, it also wasn't clear EBICO use Southern Electric for their customer services. 
918|I've been using Southern Electric since moving into my house 3 years ago.  I chose Southern Electric as after research I found their prices very competitive.  So far I have not experienced any problems whatsoever.  From an administration point of view, the bills are well laid out, and easy to read and understand.  I've had to speak to customer services on one occasion, and was pleasantly surprised by the swift and polite response in the way they dealt with my issue.  I have recently signed up to their online management site, where I can now manage my bills online, and even enter accurate electricity readings.  Overall, very happy and would recommend.
919|Southern Electricity sales team are SO RUDE!!
920|Southern Electric - Fair pricing - easy to read billing - and ( best of all) ....genuine customer care.... I'm hooked,  yiphee! 
921|Wish there were more companies like Southern Electric. They treat their customers well and don't overcharge.
922|I am a landlord with one property supplied with gas and electricity by Southern Electric. I chose this supplier over other (cheaper) ones because of generally good customer satisfaction according to online reviews. I felt I couldn't afford hassle from utilities companies as a landlord. I definitely have no regrets - the call centre is good, everything to do with connection, absent periods between tenancies, billing, and switching bills to the new tenant has been carried out efficiently and without glitches. Would definitely recommend to others, especially landlords.
923|Southern Electric are really good. uk based call centre so you can actually understand what they are saying.just seem to be efficient. sorted out house move with no problem
924|We have just joined southern electric, and they sent us a gadget that tells us exactly how much electricity we are using. Ok it uses electricity itself, but it is VERY interesting seeing what are the higher demanding appliances. Once we have assessed how to reduce our usage we will turn it off, to save even more electric!I'm expecting their customer service to be good, as they are the same company as Atlantic, who we used to be with, and they were very good. (don't ask me why we changed, was all down to other half!)
925|I have been with Southern Electric for both my gas and electricity for a long time and up until this week I have been very satisfied with the service.I pay monthly by direct debit to spread the cost through the year. I have one gas fire, used occasionally in the winter, and storage heaters. I always make sure that my bills are not estimated.I received my statements, based on accurate readings, this week. I am in credit on both, by  GBP118 on the electricity, but I was told that I would need to increase my payments, doubling the gas payment and adding another  GBP13 to the electric, and this would be taken from my account starting this month. I phoned customer services and they couldn't understand why and changed it back to what I have been paying. I know prices have increased but not by that much.
926|Have not been with Southern Electric long but already I'm seeing benefits. Already now my bills are not as high my last supplier.
927|It is very good to be with Southern Electric. They have good prices and their customer services are polite.
928|Speedy, precise customer service in handling my request.  Very friendly and helpful staff!  Accomplished all of my business in a relatively short time.
929|"switched all our services to Utility warehouse, what a disaster. Scottish power rang me (previous supplier GBP60 a month)and realized was miss sold so went back to Scottish power. I have just had my ""actual bill"" from utility warehouse for 6 weeks GBP160 even though we were guaranteed they would be cheaper. Also told we would get fibre optic as we did with sky along with early term fees from sky paid, then after installed we was told couldn't get it, and wouldn't pay our term fee with sky GBP132 (obviously because I have cancelled energy services) now left with hefty energy bill and term fees from sky GBP132 very expensive mistake made."
930|After a misunderstanding of the date the engineer was coming to our Church, the installation went smoothly. the Lady engineer was efficient and helpful. She noticed a crack in the box where the electricity entered the Church. She phoned Western Power who came out later that day and fixed it, so altogether very satisfactory.
931|My call was answered quickly and I was treated  impeccably. I requested a new sim  for my I phone   This came the very next day. I love utility w. I never have to put on speaker phone to do other things while waiting for my query to be answered. And all requests are dealt with exellentlly.
932|Really helpful on the phone. Explain your queries simply in plain English.  Bills are easy to understand and free phone number.  No complaints 
933|Prompt in response, do their best to be flexible in timing of visits for readings,very good customer service,always polite and helpful.
934|Our experience with UW has all been good from costs to technical help.The only shortcoming is our internet speed ,it's almost quicker to send a letter by post!Having said that I realise that internet speed is not totally controlled by the provider.we still think it's the best deal going
935|The costs seen to be fair in these day's of high fuel price. Customer service have been very helpful when ever I have had call them. 
936|After trying numerous other firms for my gas and electricity I find utility warehouse to have the best customer service by a long way.   You get to speak to a real person once you get to the correct department.  They take their time to answer you enquiry and do so with patience and may I say cheerfulness.   I am elderly and don't always understand what I have to do but never once have I heard a note of frustration in the other persons voice.   Unlike their rivals customer care teams where I'm made to feel a blithering old fool at times. I can't recommend them enough.   They only employ a high caliber workforce.Many thanks.
937|Excellent customer services and great utility services. I deffenetly recommend friends and families.
938|We are so pleased with Utility Warehouse that we have recommended it to several people in our block of flats - two have already changed. The monthly billing system is ideal for us - we just email our electricity meter readings each month. A problem with the Internet was solved in no time by one of their pleasant and helpful staff on a free phone call.
939|I spoke to Partner Services after a short wait and they needed to transfer me to the Technical team which was a seamless and quick process. My question/issue was dealt with quickly and professionally and resulted in a replacement part the next day, i.e. today by lunchtime.I am not aware of any other organisation anywhere in the UK that would have taken my call yesterday afternoon and replaced the part I needed to keep operating within 24 hours!Absolutely brilliant service, starting with very short time on the phone and ending with a courier delivery the following morning.This kind of service gives me massive confidence to spread the word and is a true story that will impress prospective new customers and partners.Thank you very much for fantastic service.
940|Thank you for your help I feel I can relax now My bills are sorted.  It was easy and quick. And no hard sales or bad mouthing other companies I have been telling my friends and family Well done. 
941|I was told if I added mobile phone to my current services, my utility bills would decrease, so I decided to do it, to find that it only happens if I get land line/broadband. Still went ahead, delivery service was very poor, sent to wrong address after waiting over a WK, DPD would not give me parcel cause I didn't have doc with home address, even though they do not specify on their text. I'm still waiting for mobile phone to come :(
942|I was hesitant in changing due to not completing my contract on both broadband and mobile but my worries were eased from the moment I spoke to my advisor. He explained everything precicesly and clearly. The switch has gone very well and the couple otimes I needed help were handled efficiently and successfully. I would have no hesitation in recommending Utility Warehouse to friends and relations.
943|Overall a great service and cost.  When contacted, customer service was prompt and courteous and sorted out my dilemmas immediately.  However, they should be reviewing accounts on a 6 monthly basis not 12 monthly.  Twice I had to contact them as I had in excess of GBP300 pounds in credit in the past 10 months. I would also like to see, a chart of some sort that shows me what my meter readings and fuel usage were on a running historical basis, where I can see whether my usage is more or less than the same period the previous year.
944|I requested a meter to be moved along the same wall 50cm you said you could do it then changed your mind and said you could only move it 15cm,what point would it be to move a meter 15cm, i thought this was just an excuse to get out of doing the job, i am now thinking i should have stayed with my previous supplier and i am seriously thinking of changing back to them, i will not be recommending  you to any to my friends or colleages.
945|I have been a customer of utility warehouse for over 6 years and I've always been impressed with the savings I get, plus the extra savings from the cash back card, I have even just received a Gourmet society membership completly free so now I get extra savings from the restaurants that I already eat it, including my local curry house :)I find some reviews on here a bit troll like and some I think are just down right fake, I have recommended to all my friends and family that they join the club, which is free.I have all my services with them which makes things easier for me to keep track of and I love getting 1 bill each month so I know its paid.If your thinking of joining then do it you have nothing to lose and everything to save.
946|My mobile phone was switched with no problem at all. GREAT SERVICEHome phone and Broadband went really well very easy to set up. Lots of information regarding any problems that could arise fully covered and very helpful when it came to creating an email address. All information that I needed was right in front of me in clear English.Electricity has also been changed and everything seems to be going well.Thanks very much to a satisfied customer, agent has been very helpful and supportive. 
947|I've been with Utility Warehouse for about five years now and have always been happy with the way they look after my gas and electricity accounts. Prices are fair and there are a number of additional benefits for customers, if they want to take advantage, including phone deals.Whenever I have an enquiry, I have found the Customer Service team friendly and helpful, responding promptly to calls and emails.However, the major plus for me is the money I save by paying for my gas and electric through Utility Warehouse.I would definitely recommend them as a supplier to friends and family (and have done)!
948|Overall I find the company excellent. When speaking with customer service advisers they have been found to be Curtious and patient.. I would have no hestitation in recommending the company to others. 
949|Pleased I joined Utility Warehouse. Have told others about the service
950|Once though to your team of technical staff everyone was very helpful. Only a pity the waitng time to get through to you is  far too long!   Your staff are very  patient and understanding getting me set up  thank you. 
951|Excellent and efficient from start to finish. Ordered and arrived within 72 hours.
952|Didn't have to wait long before phone was answered and the answer was prompt.
953|Whilst I find Utility Warehouse a very good company, I have one small niggle.I have oppted to read our Dual Fuel meters at the end of each month. For various reasons this is not always possible to the exact date and is sometimes the previous or next. However,your system is not able to accept this and we get an estimated reading which, over a period can be way off target.    
954|I enjoy the cash back on my utility bill by using the cash back card. Able to use it on most items. Would enjoy more variety on the grocery side but apart from that I would not give it up. 
955|it took me three goes at getting a deal. The first person I spoke to wasnt interested. anyway third time did have someone interested and got a dealif I hadnt have used uw before I would have been put off.
956|Wish I had changed over sooner.so easy.everything explainedHow it works.&I; didn't have do anything. It was all handled for me.I have recommended to friends &family.;
957|IT WAS VERY EASY TO CONECT AND JOIN ON LINE AND ALL YOUR STAFF WHERE VERY HELPFULL
958|Saving loads on everything and the bill is simple. They nearly got 5 stars I am so pleased with the cheaper utilities, broadband etc that I have now forgiven them for the almighty massive pain in the rear they caused by not adequately communicating the mobile phone switch over protocol, which led to great inconvenience. I recommend switching everything to them but ask them to list everything you need to do in relation to them and the previous mobile provider (in advance) of the switch - and / or be prepared for a couple of days or so with no mobile.
959|The prices of my bills are great.the customer services are very polite and helpful with a sound knowledge of their products.Very helpful in finding the best deal on offer.and i have passed their name to many of my friends.Thankyou utility warehouse 
960|We dealt with the transfer of Gas, Electricity, home phone, two mobile phones and broadband to Utility Warehouse during the last month and found this to be relatively straight forward.  We experienced a slight glitch with the automated service for activating the SIM card. but this was resolved when we phoned the customer service number.  They also managed to activate the voicemail service too when the automated method didn't work.Have yet to make use of the club card and will evaluate savings over the next 12 months.  All in all the transfer of all services to Utility Warehouse has been more straight forward than we anticipated and we have no complaints.
961|Utility warehouse was sold to me as being the best customer service with local UK based call centres however my experience has been completely the opposite.My average call time on the various times I have phoned with queries on my account has been about 22 mins.I have finally made decision to close my account to which I recorded a GBP400 taken from my account without any notice.Trying to get my money back from my cash back card has not been easy either.I have since moved to another provider and have saved a small GBP75 a year savings by moving but a savings nevertheless 
962|I am very pleased with your service. Regret I cannot remember the name of your staff member when I first contacted you, but he was very helpful and clear. I was recommended to you by a family member,(a club member), a Mrs. Gillian Bulford of Pinhoe,Exeter, Devon. She told me of her experience with yourselves, and of having no problems etc. The only teething problem I had was connecting to broadband, but my 12 year old grandson solved that for me. He understood how to follow my laptop screen instruction where I could not. Being 80 years old now I am not au fait with the technicalities of the situation that arose. I did contact yourselves by phone but was unable to follow your advisor's instructions over the phone. As I say, all was well. I look forward to a future of mutual cordiality.
963|So far I have been satisfied with the personal contact and service that I have received. Change overs seem to have gone smoothly and information passed on to me quickly. 
964|Better deals available elsewhere. Additional fees added when you transfer to alternative provider - all mentioned in the small print apparently but never actually brought to your attention until they send their extra bills! Definitely would NOT recommend
965|Absolutely delighted with service from Utility Warehouse.  I have always been terrified to switch suppliers because of the hassle.  Utility Warehouse make everything run smoothly and efficiently.  No hassle at all.  Highly recommended.
966|I switched to uwclub a number of years ago now.  I do not compare prices for utilities, inertia maybe (?) but I am content that uwclub supplies my needs at an acceptable cost.
967|I need my caller display reinstating it disappeared the day your company took over my account. I get lots of unwanted calls so only answer phone to callers in my directory
968|I spoke to a representative, with regards to some advice, his Customer Service was definately over and above absolutely excellent.  Extremely helpful and understood my concerns and explained everything so clearly.Fantastic Service, really was 5 star.
969|I am delighted with the level of service UW offers. Kept up to date with details and any changes. The club is excellent I've already taken advantage of the discounts available. Will be recommending my distributor and UW to everyone Taking all services saves so much in time and money and all under one roof. Superb
970|I use utility warehouse because you don't get put on hold and they deal with all my issues...Not big stuff, getting a new SIM card, getting a phone bill from 2 years ago! Changing my gas and electric to a different address... 
971|Great help, great timing, great service all round.   The staff are extremely proficient in their attitude and experience
972|I recently moved into a flat for which the utilities are managed by UW. I had never previously heard of them and was thinking simply of rolling over my extortionate and somewhat indifferent contract with a major energy supplier. After reading seriously positive reviews of Utility Warehouse and looking at their products when I realised that they were the suppliers to our flat, I telephoned them. I was very glad that I did so. The service was friendly, efficient and effective and I am now signed up!It's early days but I have not encountered problems with Utility Warehouse. I think that, not only can they provide me with cheaper energy than my previous mega-supplier, but that I even feel good about letting them have my bank details. Previously, I was so alive to the incompetence of utility companies that I paid a little more to pay quarterly so that the giant hand could be kept out of my auto-banking wallet. Here's to the beginning of a hopefully long and great relationship.
973|pay my bills religiously, around 80 pound a month but got into financial difficulty and missed 2 months, rang up to arrange to sort this out. got a payment plan.had to pay this on top of bill (no problem) but then bill went up to 140 a month and still wanted extra 48 for missed bills, couldnt afford this struggled to pay repayment. (although 140 bill still paid religiously) missed 2 of the 48pounds and forced entry into my home with a lock smith fitted gas and electric meter, and charged me an extra 500 ontop of outstanding debt...even tho my outstanding debt was only 141 pound! absolutley disgusted with this treatment. do not use them
974|someone actually listened to me, and did their best to accomodate my plea. I was very impressed with how my problem was dealt with, and can hon estly say, at last someone listens and gives great advice. Wish all companies were the same. Well done Utility Warehouse. There waqs actually a lot I liked and nothing negative with the conversation...
975|I am so annoyed I changed to go to utility warehouse on recommendation however wish I hadn't. My wifi only connects to my phone and not my tablets which I need for work I have called UW for over two hours last night and although very polite. Problem still not fixed I haven't been able to work all day and really regretting my switch over wished I hasn't changed 
976|Been trying to activate my cashback card for over 8 days to be told the address on my debit card does not match. Ive checked with bank all.matches, then utility had to make changes to theirs, then speak to card services and still getting told.its my bank. Rang bank again to be told they can see transactions and its their machine software that is failing. Tried with another debit card same problem. After approx 15 calls they still saying its my issue now 8 days no cash back and still.no resolve. Going to cancel account with them.if not resolved in 48hours totally fed up.
977|Our local distributor has been so helpful, I've been able to call her for advice and she has always dealt with whatever query I have. It's so nice to be able to talk personally with someone instead of being on the telephone for ages and being transferred from one department to the next for assistance.
978|I am very happy with service, customer  service  is excellent. Bills are easy to understand. 
979|recently taken the full utiliy warehouse sevices, problems with my i phone 
980|Excellent service with knowledgeable people. Covers all aspects of daily lives...gas electric mobile and home phones and the benefit of cash back money cards.
981|UW takes forever to answer the phone - waited well over half an hour both times I've called! 
982|We have been good customers for several years. My husband signed up with the company for a package deal for gas, electricity, telephone, internet and my mobile telephone. I have never had such a stressful and miserable time, all of which was caused by appalling customer service from Utility Warehouse with our recent house move. They promised seamless service and a stress free move for all our requirements. The reality was they disconnected our landline before we moved, transferred the number to a property we were not moving to and disconnected my mobile service, twice. They did this quite cynically, even though they know that I am disabled, vulnerable and had no landline in the new property. There were queries for some of the gas and electricity readings, but I felt blackmailed into paying whatever they charged just to restore my mobile - which is on a contract. Finally, after many lengthy and time wasting telephone calls - it took over 45 minutes on one occasion to actually speak to someone, they promised to send a final bill for the true metre readings and guaranteed that my mobile service would be protected until I had received this. In fact they disconnected the service (again) before I received what is actually a final demand letter - not a final itemised bill, as promised. I immediately paid the demand but have to wait another 24 hours before the service will be restored, even though they know I am ill and might require urgent medical assistance. I also had to give them direct debit details for my bank account, even though I have told them I would rather pay the penalty for ending the contract than continue with this company.  To say that I am disgruntled, dissatisfied and disappointed with the lack of care and by heartless treatment I have received, does not begin to cover my true feelings. Please be advised never to deal with this disreputable, greedy and dishonest company.  
983|I wouldn't hesitate to tell a friend about the excellent service I experience with Utility warehouse! Planning to do my Gas and electric with Utility warehouse in the future! You're in great hands with Utility warehouse! BLESS.I like everything about it! Can't think of a dislike right now. 
984|From our point of view this is a versatile company giving us competitive rates in gas, electricity, TV and phone, including mobiles and not tied to one supplier. Problems with phones were speedily attended to as were the adjustments in setting up solar panels, etc.Also their receptionists are refreshingly attentive and relaxed when discussing the various questions that occur from time to time.
985|Very easy to understand billing combined with competitive prices for all offered services.I love the UW Discount club which offers discounts from a number of high street shops and lots of Online shoping,and the savings are deducted from my UW monthly bill.Utility Warehouse offers a very good service  and I even receive discounts for introducing friends to take their energy and communications services from UW.I'd recommend Utility Warehouse and it's very easy to change from your current suppliers. 
986|I dont normally do reviews good or bad!I was really frustrated with UW a couple of weeks back I discovered I was not alone!It looks like a bit of engineered reputation management has been deployed, now dont get me wrong a boost for your business is one thing but it feels to me like youre working the same old selling tactics on a review site. Personally I find that type of behaviour deplorable.Heres my story - I was a customer from 2012 - 2015My first couple of bills, started at GBP165pcm for Phone Broadband, Gas Electricity I even took on the Distributer roll as I believed that the company genuinely offered value and savings, despite being more expensive than our previous provider!Money Back promises coupled with the SAVE SAVE SAVE splattered all over everything you see/read The more you take the more you save. This was not the case for me! - Therefore I could not recommend products or services not believing the savings are genuine! (I didnt!)They codged my Bill up in month 3 it went up to GBP200, I phoned and complained so they reduced it to GBP100 Month 5 it was up to GBP120 and it started to creep up on a monthly basis after 12 months I was paying GBP140 - I got a 12 month Money Back Promise which is when really started to go wrong.Circa 10% cash back knocked off the bill and coincidently a bill revision where they decided that for the previous 12m they had under charged me!Our revised bill went back up to GBP160 which again started to increase month on month rising up to cGBP170 In November 2014 we had a government rebate of GBP12 and yet again another bill review - You guessed it UW undercharged again so our new monthly set at GBP190 In my time they striped back all the promotions, free anytime phone calls replaced with off peak - Insurance Cover replaced with Bill Protector, Cash Back Companies dropping out (Yes I took the Cash Back Card too - actually 2x payable monthly!) Enough is enough! I call to see what could be done about my ever increasing bill!These are some of their suggestions.Add Mobile as a 5th service, I explained that they were too expensive including the forecasted savings. The next suggestion, spend more money on your cash back card (I have got no money to spend on the card!) Use less energy! (are you for real?) I have a budget plan to budget, I supply you with meter readings.Pay even more and Fix rates for the next XX years!After much deliberation / arguing and with a full orchestra of violins, we eventually get to the bottom of the issue!We increase the tariff prices in Feb 2014 - The increased monthly payment incorporates paying off your arrears.. now were getting to the crux of it!Im in despair and its rubbing off! One of their advisors splurts out Were not always the cheapest Have you compared recently? This flies in the face of everything they normally tell you! Naively I had not looked elsewhere! I had mistakenly trusted the word both written and verbally communicated SAVE MONEY! GAURANTEED SAVINGS Join the Discount Club that saves you money every dayIm trying to keep this brief (Honestly, Im so annoyed with myself!)In short I went on the MSE website I very quickly discovered the truth! My new energy bill is Est at GBP100 - Im going to say GBP130 to be safe!I also switched Phone and Broadband, Including anytime calls and factoring in a cashback plus I paid the line rental upfront my total annual bill is GBP180 (GBP15pcm) The UW monthly Bill of GBP190 has been reduced to a possible GBP115 worst case GBP145 (therefore Im between GBP540 & GBP900 better off a year) thats not including any money back offers from cashback sites, loyalty points or any other misleading sales strategy - e.g I could get referral money off my bills for recommending a friend!Make your own mind up! Are all these 5* reviews genuine? Personally I think not! The various energy comparison sites now compare UW and the results were accurate to my bill, so my savings appear to be genuine and substantial! (Only time will tell)Before you switch to any other energy company compare first! Dont be hoodwinked by reviews or celebrity endorsements! 
987|I was talked into this by a workmate and regretted it as soon as their supply was connected but not working.It took 3weeks to resolve, when compared to my previous supplier their energy prices are not cheaper either even though I was promised they will be,what makes them cheaper is spending on their loyalty card.Don't bother...total waste of time
988|It is too early to judge properly. But so far our Broadband is so much more reliable, especially with the IPad.
989|helpfull, fast, friendly im sorry to say i found every body realy nice so i dont know what esle to write
990|Staff are very responsive and helpful with any queries and they are easy to contact.  It seems that 'Utility Warehouse' aim to keep prices in check for benefit of customers, but it is not clear whether or not U.W. consistently trawls the market to obtain the best deals for customers.  There is no easy comparison with other suppliers as regards prices charged.  However, taking all into consideration, i.e. service, billing, I am satisfied as a customer.
991|I like a good price for gas and electricity and the ability to have a monthly a/c plus able to submit regular readings.I enjoy cash back from various stores using the cash back card  which is pre loaded so I cannot overspend 
992|currently using telephone which is clear and easy to do.I used to use E mail which equally straight forward.
993|We have been with UW for some years for our utilities, but have recently added mobiles and broadband too. The service we have received has been brilliant, and the staff are always so thoughtful and helpful in very way. My husband who is very discerning, has got nothing but praise for UW
994|After being persuaded by a friend to move to a new supplier I went through 1 year of suffering until the contract ran out. In all the years I had been with UW I had no problems, was able to contact them easily and there where a pleasure to deal with. I trust them which means a lot in the world today.  I am very happy to be back and promise I will never move again. Cheap is not everything but trust is. There are many special deals out there but many of them seem to be not quiet what they seem.
995|I would recommend Utility Warehouse without any hesitation. Customer service is excellent.
996|Service excellent as always. This questionnaire  set up to  a bit confusing it made me want to not bother. Prob won't participate again in feed back. 
997|Well so far they've been treating me very well. They've got the one of the best customer services.
998|Had a problem with my warehouse card. It was dealt with quickly and simply with explanation and resolution.
999|Quick reply. well mannered, answered my question right away. Many thanks
1000|I have been a member of Utility Warehouse for some 20 years and have had no problems in either services or assistance with technicalities.  This telephone conversation regarded the GBP6.00/month 'Peak Saver' option which gives nearly all phone calls free.  The lady who explained it to me was very helpful and efficient and I signed up gladly.  all my services are now with Utility Warehouse.     
1001|First class service everytime I contacted them.  
1002|I remain a satisfied customer after several years. I continue to save money, I rarely need to get in touch but when I do they answer promptly and are polite and helpful, I would recommend them to everyone.
1003|Absolutely fantastic service, very friendly staff.  I tell my fiends and family what a brilliant customer service I get from Utility Warehouse
1004|We have been very pleased with the service and prices over the last few years. The energy prices are very competitive and the broadband rates have compared favourably except when competitors launch special offers. Would be nice to get a better discount for multiple products.My advice to anyone is do the sums, and I would be very surprised if you can't show a saving.
1005|There can be nothing better than to have regular correspondence and good service offering the most attractive rates for utilities.The monthly booklets helps to explain everything and make yearly and monthly comparisons of costs etc.One never needs to look any further for deals. Meters are checked regularly so no worry of under payments.
1006|A friend wanted to find out about electricity prices. Utility Warehoue were kind enough to provide all the information needed. The friend was grateful. The detailed billing which one can obtain from UW is a very useful feature.
1007|I've been with UW for several years and have had no bad experiences, am happy with the billing and breakdowns are very clear.  They've been helpful when I had phone them to cancel my direct debit once, and facilitated me to pay it the following week, with no penalties.I love that I get to speak to a UK customer services without a long wait.I have not been comparing bills online, though in comparison to my friends my bills seem good value.What I would like is more choice on the renewable energy side.A downside also is that if you haven't paid your bill, your services .. phine etc can be suspended.  However, if you contact them before the bill debits, I've found them helpful to assist a payment plan, so it seems reasonable.
1008|Positive,knowledgable and helpful staff that backs up the smart way to manage and pay for your utilities. What's not to like about single billing,competitive rates and a cash card system that if used effectively can cover your mobile bill just by you shopping where you would anyway. Utilise across both personal and business accounts so can focus on running our business and enjoying life and let UW take the hassle of managing the bills.
1009|"Just a very quick review - we was sold this idea that it would save you money etc - always happy to save money when we can.In simple terms, this place costs you more in time, effort & energy. They won't save you money, they can;t do anything right and they are a complete pain in the rear end - they are just as bad as the ""big 4"" all they care about is GBPGBPGBPGBPGBP - AVOID AVOID AVOID - they tell lies & simply do not care. We transfer both our phones to them and this was a mistake - they bill so awkward - really doesn't help. The network doesn't work - simply put, lucky to get any service and all we get is ""no service"" joke of company been dealing with issues since day one September 2014 and i've spent more money on the phone and time lost it's driving me up the wall. My advice, good luck to anyone dealing with them"
1010|Had to contact them to take me off economy 7 and onto a normal tariffDidn't have to ring expensive phone lines, got through straight away to a really helpful member of staff. The whole thing was dealt with quickly and promptlyGreat service!
1011|I had a small enquiry and contacted the company by phone. it was dealt with in a quick and satisfactory manner
1012|I had been losing my internet connection intermittently and called the tech support at Utility Warehouse for help. I did have to wait a while to speak to someone but once i did i was impressed. The chap I spoke to guided me through every step in a polite and helpful way once he had called me back on my mobile. We tried various unplugging and plugging in of filters, phone wires etc. The whole process did take a long time. Eventually it was agreed that i could benefit from a new wireless router which was dispatched and received promptly. The internet is now running very well. Thank you.
1013|Everything went fine
1014|A profesional and helpful service, which I would recommend to family and friends. Thank you!
1015|Answered call quite quickly only had a small query but was delt with quick and efficiently good service.
1016|Whenever I phone to either give meter readings or with a query, I always without fail, have a helpful member of staff who deals with my query quickly and efficiently and with a friendly manner, if unable to help me, I will be connected to another member of staff who can.I never feel rushed or that I am a nuisance. 
1017|Good professional people who always try to help
1018|Always very helpful when I phone. Excellent service never had any problems. 
1019|My new mobile phone required a micro simm card. I phoned the Utility Warehouse late Monday afternoon on the 29th of December, and received the simm card in the post on Wednesday the 31st of December! What an excellent service! I also have my Gas & Electricity from Utility Warehouse and would highly recommend them to anyone.
1020|Excellent way to save money on your bills ! More money left at the end of the monthHave been with them for many years with no regrets !Reccomend everyone to look into changing supplier and look into Utility Go ahead be sensible nothing lost by comparing
1021|  I don't have mush thing to say right now because i just started with you hopefully next time i maybe i can say more but for now i can only say this for now and hope thing will improve and i will stay with you for a long time and thing will be better.
1022|The utility wherehouse offers excellent value for money. The fact that the more services you have with them the more you save is fantastic for me as I'm on a low income. I have broadcall mobile gas electric and the peak saver allows me to call 01 02 and 03 numbers. The only thing I didn't like was that I was struggling to.pay a bill on a payment plan and an adviser from utility wherehouse wasn't sympathetic to my situation and as a result I tried to kill myself because of the stress it caused me.   The advisers need to be more sympathetic to customers situations
1023|Since joining this supplier, Utility Warehouse  has provided a good quality service. Any enquiries are dealt with efficiently with friendly staff.  Taking a monthly meter reading helps to inform customers of energy issues. It was good to receive the refund in  the bill as a result of a government refund to suppliers. It is hoped that this good service continues to offer level of quality to their customers. 
1024|You need to know who are the friendliest beasts. The one you choose should be fair in their pricingand open about how they come to their decisions on billing. They should be polite and helpful and recognise thatpeople need to be helped through what can be a very aggressive and rapacious environment.Of course, jungles don't breed or shelter angels, so I'm not about to wax too lyrical - but I've found that in most regards, the Utility Warehouse is a beast with whom I am relatively safe. So I willstick with him - and advise others to do likewise.
1025|The young man who helped me with my F.I.T application was very helpful and re-assuring. I managed to get my photos accepted before the deadline. I was very pleased by this since I had generated quite a lot of electricity.I like that you can actually talk to someone, even if it takes a wee while to get through. Well done for having pleasant staff! 
1026|Always friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They seem to make your concerns theirs and strive to find solutions. Highly recommended and competitive pricing as well!
1027|i never been less satisfied with the customer care i have reveived over the last few years.the manner of person on the other side always been polite and calm.always got the answer i was looking for.the prices always been very competitive.i cant see any reason of me looking for another supplier.one trhink i dont like is the lack of sending some one to read both meters as ofen as possible.
1028|I have reserved this review for a few weeks. I have read some dreadful reviews but my experience is great. What has impressed me the most has been the technical support staff for phone and Broadband. Quick to answer the phone, VERY clued up and helpful, actually go overboard if anything!As I am setting everything up I have called quite a bit and ALWAYS had real UK people that understand me and explain everything in a helpful way. I'll see how I get on with everything for the next few months.
1029|We are 'Gold' customers, we are abroad as 2 self employed busy people. Utility Warehouse do not offer an international package. We discovered this when at the start of a 3 week holiday in France: It took 6 days for U-Warehouse to actually connect International roaming to 1 of our 2 mobile phones, for the other we were so desperate we bought a competitors sim. Not only do they not get you connected, they charge a fortune when you are: They also don't allow 'paring' your phone to your computer, thus making our capacity to work abroad impossible. We have lost 2 days of our holiday. Chasing UW, and it has cost us a fortune calling them, as they dont offer a 'call back'. AVOID
1030|Utility Warehouse, have in the experience of my company been very helpful and assisting on the rare occasion we have had to contact them regarding any issue. My company would have absolutely no problem with recommending them.
1031|Utility Warehouse is very reasonably priced and I have had no technical difficulties. On the rare occasions when I have to call them I have been treated courteously and professionally. They have special offers which can help to lower the cost of calls. I am always astonished how cheap my monthly bill is. I buy fifty pounds worth of calls and this lasts a considerable time.
1032|expellant company to deal with whole package deal very good value for money.they can offer you so much tailored to your needs
1033|An excellent prompt and polite service and soooooo nice to speak to someone based in the UK who could:a) understand me b) me understand them 
1034|We have been with Utility Warehouse for about 5 or 6 years, the whole package Gas, Electric, Phone and Broadband and like that we have monthly bills and put our readings in every month so there are no nastly surprises and find that with the paperwork is relativly easy to understand. The only negative is we find the broadband a little slow.
1035|UW offer a one stop solution with mobile, phone, debit card, electricity, gas, broadband and mobile in all one place. Only one bill on-line and on paper which is easy to understand. Great value for money and good technical help on-line and by phone
1036|My contacts with UW have always been most professionally handled, quickly, clearly and with amiability. Thoroughly recommended!
1037|The first young man I spoke to could not help me, but after ringing back another guy tried and even though he needed to get help from a colleague he made sure everything was working fine for me and was really helpful.
1038|I reciently need to phone U/W customer service department as i had a query this was sorted out in minutes the Lady on the end of the phone was very friendly very proffesional.and i cant praise her enough
1039|I have been using utilityware house foe a number of years for both powers and pay by direct debit.  I like to think that I am getting a good deal and the honour there pledge to ensure that the price we pay is below the six largest power companies.  So far I am happy with the service but would like them to email about once a year to say yes we are offering you a price below the big six. That would make me feel valued.
1040|I was very impressed by the efficiency demonstrated by yourselves in transferring my phone and broadband which were reconnected in my new  home on moving day. Any problems I have had have been dealt with in the same way.Also it was easy to contact you as opposed to many other companies.
1041|Am in the process of moving house - second time in 7 months - and cannot praise Utility Warehouse enough for the ease of transferring gas/electricity/phone and Wifi over from one address to the other.  Great to know also that you aren't kept waiting for ages when you call - calls always answered very quickly and level of customer service is excellent.  
1042|Change was easy and well handled, it was swift and very efficient.Since then clear bills arrive following my posting meter readings.  Good to speak to someone in the UK.Overall fully recommended.
1043|I am still very happy with the service and price i get from Utility Warehouse for my gas and electricity. Every time i get a phone call from another supplier saying how good their prices are i just say i am with Utility Warehouse and they go ok sorry and hang up as they can never beat the price i get.It was easy to set up and with the cashback card it makes everything else better as the more i use the card the more money i get taken off my bill which always makes me happy.So if you haven't signed up to Utility Warehouse yet, why not. 
1044|Great service they will always ask see if you need any help they always make sure you get the best service and always asks see if you have any questions  I enjoy being with them they are also quick at answering your call and when I had a problem with my meater they got someone out as as they could 
1045|all communication with utility has been brilliant everything gets sorted very quickly and the staff are always very polite, cheerful and professional would always recommend to friends and family.
1046|Just been cold called by another utility firm, which I usually hang up on to be fair, but had a change of heart this evening. I listened to their pricing, their comparison to UW and when they said they would save me GBP85 a month, I politely told them I'd get back to them, assuming this to be inaccurate. However, I then checked on Uswitch, and presto, this also shows that on the Value tariff for UW, the First Utility saving is over GBP1000 a year.I don't mind paying a premium for excellent service, good products, piece of mind, but I don't like being ripped off! GBP1000 a year difference is beyond a joke. Of course I will now make the switch, but have emailed UW to find out why after promising so much 8 years ago when I joined them, they are now shafting me on the price. Even with their Double Gold rates, I would still save over GBP800 a year.However, looking back at the comments, seems that UW do have a habit of replying to every customer complaint, with exactly the same spiel 'I cannot locate your records, please contact customer support'. No explanation ever. Would be nice to see a reply that explains why their prices are so uncompetitive without needing to know the customers account information, to show a little honesty and transparency, more than I can expect here I am sure, but would be a refreshing change.When I started out with UW, their lower rates and ability to refer people with adiscount per customer referral, seemed like a good gesture. Plus Sainsburys discount cashback was 5 or 6%, now just 3%, so even that benefit is eroded.The Discount Club is not worthwhile, and we spend GBP800 a month in Sainsburys, so get back about GBP20 off our utilities still GBP60 more per month than First Utility, which will hold prices for 18 months.I'm disgusted that my utility costs are so much higher than UW competitors. No doubt I will find something wrong when I move, but on first encounters, First Utility seem reasonable and came top of the Uswitch savings table.I am giving UW a 1 Star Rating, because in my view, a company should never be 50% higher on their products, which is effectively the situation with my bills. 
1047|I was very happy with the service I received, staff answered all my questions, and offered relavant information, but I do not need them to ask me how my day has been, that is not relavant and does not take away from the staff being helpful by not asking I still get a good call and go away very satisfied
1048|Whenever I've called the staff have always been very helpful and seem to deal with my requests efficiently. We have our home phone with utility warehouse because they offer the best rates that we could find for international calls. 
1049|I was glad I phoned my queries were answered to my absolute satisfaction and thengentleman  was very polite
1050|I HAVE BEEN WITH THESE A WHILE NOW AND FIND THEM VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY AND DISABLED FRIENDLY I AM VERY HAPPY WITH RATES I PAY 
1051|I changed to U W 4 years ago and have never had reason to regret my decision.  Customer service is excellent which is very rare theses days. The biggest plus for me is the cash back card.
1052|I feel it is good value for money and the information provided monthly helps to monitor usage.
1053|I swapped from Scottish Power as I thought the electricity we was using was going far to fast. I have found now that I have increased the weekly spend on electricity.The agent to who came to our house was great, no problem with him, but the actual spend has increased. I have yet to receive a bill for the Gas, but to be honest I am dreading this now. 
1054|I appreciate the good value products provided by UW and the service provided. I have never been tempted by ads, by other providers, to swap.  I believe that UW is consistently lower priced.I have always found the staff very helpful when I have needed to 'phone. The paperwork is easy to understand.
1055|After meeting the local agent I decided to change my electricity supplier and it was the best deal I have done. I had very few problems, and any queries about my account since  have always been quickly answered with the help of the agent who is very helpful and efficient. I keep a regular check, via the internet of tariffs etc and am still more than happy with my deal and your service.
1056|I have been using UW since Jun 2011 and I have moved 3 times since then.  Each time the service has been very friendly and extremely helpful.  A great utility company I can fully endorse them to anyone lost in the Utility maze.  Thanks UW
1057|Since I have been with this company I have been more than satisfied with there performance and would  recamend them to any one.
1058|Am happy with the service and everything is working perfectly good. Will recommend others to join in
1059|One of the best utility companies i have dealt with. No hassle with easily understood monthly bills. Good value for money.
1060|I found the staff of U W to be very polite and helpful and they don't make you feel silly with your questions. I would recommend them to anybody, who wants to change there utilities without a lot of hassle and save money. 
1061|I am over 80 so have had plenty of experience in dealing with Utility companies.I have found this organisation a cut above the rest. If you have a query or request the staff go out of their way to help and solve the problem.
1062|It was well worth the move from one supplier to The utility warehouse,from staff helping to complete the paperwork the form (PV installation) is not the clearest form to complete nothing was to much effort was well impressed. I believe that if you where able to use the smart meter technology would be a step forward you would have all the information to see how individual customers making use of there energy and more accurate bills generated.
1063|I have been a satisfied customer of Utility Warehouse for almost two years, and recommended my brother-in-law to sign up too. When he died recently, I had to call U/W to report the death and arrange for his telephone service to be continued in the name of his executors for the time being. I spoke to two different people, who readily understood what was required, and dealt with the matter quickly and sensitively. 
1064|Once we managed to get our account up and running there have been no problems with supply or billing.  The statement arrives on time and is always exact and not estimated.  The fact there is no fixed contract length makes this a good choice.
1065|IF I HAVE A PROBLEM OR A QUERY AND I PHONE ABOUT IT I GET HELPFUL ADVICE IN A PLEASANT MANNER FROM A HUMAN BEING AND NOT AN ANSWER MACHINE, BEING OLD AND A BIT BRAIN DEAD I NEED YO TALK TO PEOPLE NOT PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM WHEN I HAD TO WORK FOR A LIVING AND I DO NOT WANT THEM IN MY LIFE ANYMORE. I HAVE NO RESERVATIONS AT ALL ABOUT UTILITY WAREHOUSE AND I WOULD AND HAVE RECOMMENDED THEM TO FAMILY AND CLOSE FRIENDS. THEY AS GOOD AS IT GETS THESE DAYS.   
1066|Although the lady was very helpful and assured me it the form was in the post over 2 weeks ago...I am still waiting! We have tried to sort this out twice previously and still the issue has NOT  been sorted and loath to spend ages on the phone yet again. Its a simple change of name on the mobile but it seems to be rocket science trying to get it done! Not impressedin this instance!
1067|Very good service but no nano sim so I can't use the phone I can't call 0800 numbers
1068|Answer telephone quickly. Always polite and always manage to  solve problem. I can always understand what they are saying and they obviouslyunderstand me. This is very important as it means you can get yourproblem understood quickly and solved.
1069|Regular meter readings, happy to change direct debit amounts regularly depending on usage so you don't end up in massive amounts of credit or debit, understandable detailed bills - what's not to like?! I have never felt so secure and trusting of a utilities company before - I didn't feel like they were trying to get the most money possible out of me, and let me submit regular meter readings online, which were always then updated on the next bill, and if it looked like I was paying too much or too little, the direct debit was amended accordingly. 
1070|Miss one month payment and they send a debt collector to your door. Miss 2 months payment and they take you to court without prior notification to force entry into your property to fit card meters and charge you approx GBP750 in fees to do this. 5 guys turn up to do this and it feels very much like the mafia have arrived. I'm going back to British Gas who treat their customers with respect and I can pay my bill quarterly. 
1071|I am sick of receiving sales calls, mostly from the Far East it seems, so I decided to check our status. Your customer relations lady. The very tone of her voice was right from the beginning and she quickly established a good rapport by understanding my frustration. She explained that our number was in fact on the 'preference list' but explained that many of the call-centres concerned withheld their numbers making it impossible to block further contact. She said that where a number could be traced action could be taken to stop future calls. Altogether, her manner was understanding and sympathetic. I have been checking 1471 ever since and intend to follow her advice when the opportunity arises. She is an excellent ambassador for Ulility Warehouse.    Frank Farmer 
1072|I can honestly say that I have never regretted signing up with Utility Warehouse. I am confident that I get the best deal for my energy, I get cash back on my shopping, and the few times that I have telephoned with an enquiry they have been extremely helpful.  I can't ask for more! My agent is really attentive, sending reminders to read meters and informing us of any deals or offers. I recommend you to people all the time.
1073|I like the idea that someone is looking out for the best deals for me.  I do get fed up with having to read my meters every month but if it saves money it's OK.  It took a time to settle down with the FIT administration but that is also now running smoothly. Their customer service is excellent, the staff are very polite and helpful.  All in all the best deal I've found.
1074|There is always someone on the other end of the phone immediately if you need help.  It is very rare I have waited more than a few seconds to speak to anyone, and when I do, they are always courteous, polite and most of all, offer solutions to my problems.  My bills are AT LEAST GBP50 cheaper every month.  If you haven't joined Utility Warehouse yet, you are wasting your time and money!!
1075|the person on phone was polite friendly and professional .she chatted a little but kept to what i had called about,she explained it had been done and also asked if there was anything else she could help me with.  
1076|PLUS: For those with Solar PV, UW's concession whereby Club Members can pay by Variable Direct Debit in ARREARS, with the FIT credited monthly against the Electricity Bill, provided the customer  reports on-line/by phone the Supply and Generation meter readings on the last day of the month, is a perfect solution to the huge variation over the Solar year between Grid Usage and Generation, and resulting 'swings & roundabouts' of the monthly bill.  The system reallu does work, faultlessly.UW's monthlu Invoices are now. after much refinement, very good: accurate, easy the read, comprehensive and informative.MINUS: Getting UW Customer Services to reply to an email is like getting blood from a stone:  usually impossible.UW needs to sharpen its act in this area.  Monthly bills waste a lot (up to 15%) of paper with blank pages.Don't understand the Length of Review Traffic Light bar chart below
1077|I so like this service provider. If I have a query, it is so easy to speak to someone on the telephone and they can always help.And I know where I stand with my budget on a monthly basis.
1078|my monthly gas and electric plus two mobile sim is a price i think fair and acceptable. cheaper than when i was with e.on and orange. every time i ring call center they are nice and helpful. i will not switch to another company. but i am not sure about your internet speed, i use virgin because with them for 7 years. if your broadband fast and never stop i will use yours. 
1079|We had our scepticism at the start but we were told it's easy to get things sorted out and they weren't wrong any problems or queries regarding service or supply any you are only to happy to help and calls are answered ASAP without a 40 min hanging on the line can't fault the level of service and hope to stay for many years to come 
1080|For the past 5 years you have supplied the house I used to live with Electricity and Gas, also with Internet and Phone for 3 years. We never had any problems with the bills or anything of that kind. I was very pleased with your services and your client service operators have been always very helpfull at all times when we needed. I would definitely recomend your company to anyone. Thank you very much!
1081|Happy with service etc. Helpful and polite when you ring up.
1082|So easy to switch my electricity over. Huge savings to be had with all the regular cash back deals.No problems at all so far, wish I'd have changed earlier.
1083|First time on the website and found it friendly and straight forward.
1084|I am very impressed by the service,everything was explained in an easy to understand way,the sales people were really friendly and I  am sure to benefit on my bills 
1085|"Customer service 10 out of 10, excellent rates. Couldn't fault them. Recently moved into property utility warehouse were previous home owners provider, I had the opportunity to switch but after talking to the extremely friendly customer service team, I didn't want to switch. I have used the the ""big six"" in the past, never been blown away by service or rates but I am genuinely a happy customer now.Thank you"
1086|I was puzzled why my consumption of power seemed to vary so much.  no obvious ideas were put forward.  odd as I doubt if my needs vary much.
1087|I have been a member for some years. I find them reasonably priced, and as I have PV panels it is easy to run the electricity I produce in with the electricity and gas that I buyThere is always someone to speak to during office hours. There is a good web site. Although I don't use their other packages but it is still a good deal
1088|I needed to change bank account details which I'm pleased to say I couldn't do online, so keeping my details safe.This was dealt with in a two or three minute 'phone call.
1089|Meter readings are not always taken when sent by e mail but when telephoned through always ok. When that happens an incorrect bill is then submitted, leading to frustration.  Staff always helpful when communicating by phone.
1090|just always like the service i get, always very nice and helpful, not a lot else i can say.
1091|great service answer the phone fast and are very helpful.
1092|this is one of several services I purchase onn a monthly basis through Utility Warehouse. I find the company quick and responsive to phone calls with well spoken helpful staff who answer the calls quickly and clearly. Always polite and helpful- any queries are handled immediately. Prices remain competitive - as I understand it they readily match competitors and offer customers the est prices available. Going on line is simple and the web site is clear and simple to use. Although I have arranged a monthly regular charge to spread the cost throughout the year, I like the fact that Utility Warehouse re-assess this annually with out being asked. However, I can alter it sooner if I want.
1093|i have no problem with gas and electricity supply.   I have a problem with broadband and mobile. Neither of these services work properly at this address despite your engineers trying to fix problem.  You mobile section suggested I purchase pay as you go sim card which I did from Tesco works perfectly.  I still have to pay your contract intil April not pleased when you sold me the iPhone you knew my address and that your signal would not work properly here.  Broadband seemed to work until a couple of months ago when I contact your engineers they tried hard (which I appreciated) to fix my problem but had to admit that I was only getting 2.5 speed.  As I said gas and electricity I can not fault  and would recommend but broadband and iPhone not.I have mentioned before that whenever I need to report a fault with phone or broadband call is not answered for 15 to 20 minutes just keep getting (we are experiencing high number of calls you may wish to call later). In fairness when the call is finally answered I must say  the staff are very courteous and helpful
1094|I was able to resolve an issue with sending monthly FIT meter readings with one phonecall.It does take a while to get connected to a actual person but once I was; the matter was speedily dealt with. I have no complaints about the way I was dealt with and as I usually do all my contact via the UW website this was reassuring that there is someone there to help when the need arises.
1095|Very pleased with the help given have now decided will be back in touch soonAsked about broad band and phone providers and costs
1096|"1. Don't like that we spend time in collecting and submitting meter readings and you make no allowance for it whereas you pay when you send your own meter reader. Its time you put in "" Remote readable meters "" or gave customer an allowance same as what you pay your meter reader.2. Not happy that you don't consider debiting our Utility Cash Back Card for our Utility Bills and give us some Cash Back just as you do with purchases from other suppliers.3. Do like the fact that we are not tied down to a long contract."
1097|I wanted to know about moving and the process was explained to me and any questions I had were answered first time. great service
1098|As a new customer of 3 months I am amazed to have waited since September to get my hands on an iPhone 6, 8 weeks and numerous phone calls and each answer is different 
1099|I have been with Utility Warehouse for a number of years now and have never had a problem with them. They are relatively easy to get hold of, if you have a problem, and you do get to speak to a human being who you can understand, without jumping through hoops! Recently, my phone connection chose to give up on me and after reporting it and being told it was a network problem -( something to do with a jumper!!!), I was kept informed of progress reasonably well. Although it took longer than I would have liked to be completely sorted, this was largely my own fault in that they were unable to get access to the property to find the cause of the secondary fault, once the jumper had been replaced. All in all pretty satisfied with them.
1100|After more than a decade buying my electricity, gas, telephone and internet service from Utilities Warehouse, I have been very satisfied with the price and service. I like the utilities package delivered from a single company and I especially like the monthly billing arrangement   all on one bill. It works for me and I would recommend Utilities Warehouse every time. I check around the market a couple of times a year and I don't find any compelling reason to change supplier. Provided Utilities Warehouse continues to sell me these utilities services in the same reasonable and cost effective manner as for the previous decade, I will remain a customer.
1101|The young man was extremely helpful in taking me through the steps necessary to reorganise my rooter in order that I was once again linked to the outside world.  He did this in a relaxed manner using straight forward vocabulary - a pleasure to deal with.
1102|I like the clear bills .and easy to send my metre readings to.A nice person to speak to on moving hpuse.If you ate thinking of changing to an other suplyer i can recomend ,Utilty ware house. They are not ghe cheapest but midway 
1103|I love that I can trust Utilities Warehouse 100% to give me great prices for my Gas, Electricity, Home phone (with line rental) and broadband! One bill...One direct debit...zero stresses and strains. I have ways found the customer service exemplary and friendly too.I have no hesitation to recommend Utilities Warehouse 100%!Thank you...3 addresses later and I'm still with you!
1104|"After numerous lengthy telephone calls to UW regarding my faulty iphone, and unable to sort the issue, they have now decided to arrange a courier to pick up phone and issue me with a new one.  My Daughter had explained to them that I am going on holiday this week and need a phone, ""so please do not send her any old phone""  I have my fingers crossed that Monday's delivery will be favourable.On an entirely different subject, I emailed customer service to ask if they would send me details of prices for using my phone in Cape Verde and if I needed to top up my funds.  They have failed to answer.  I know it has been received as the person I was speaking to on the phone quoted it even though we were talking about a different issue."
1105|Electricity and gas just taken ,too early to commentBroadband/fone too expensive and not as flexible as AOL/TalkTalkMobile offer also.
1106|Spoke to a customer services employee and was so pleased about how he handled my enquiry, have to honestly say that there's not many companies out there that would inform you that they are due YOU money. Thanks Utility Warehouse. Great service . 
1107|My wife and I have used the Utility Warehouse for many years both at the house where we now live in Dorset and where we used to live in London. We have found the prices to be consistently good value. I particularly like the monthly bill, which is clear and easy to understand. The staff have been helpful and polite when I have had occasion to phone them. It is difficult to think of anything that I do not like. I have already recommended to friends. 
1108|wish I had changed years ago
1109|I have spoken to several different people at Utility Warehouse and they have all been helpful and friendly. They have explained everything in clear terms, and have been happy to find the answers to all my questions. I went to Utility Warehouse in the first place because I was impressed by reviews, particularly in the Which magazine site. So far I have found the reviews to be correct. 
1110|The question was answered quickly and politely
1111|Exactly as it was explained, has been how it has been, and it is only money I would be spending anyway
1112|Very understanding and supportive. Pointed me in the right direction and matter is now resolved. 
1113|thank you for my monthly statement it keeps my account book up to date 
1114|I have been a UW customer for about 9 or 10years I should think. I have all their services - gas, electric, broadband, mobile and home phone. In the past I have also had two 0800 numbers (for different businesses)as well. I find it very convenient to have all my charges on one bill as I can't stand paperwork! Whenever I've had to ring customer services I have found them to be helpful & knowledgeable. I first joined when I met my distributor as a networking meeting and he also has been very helpful whenever I've needed his assistance. It's also great when on receiving those sales calls or bumping into other utility companies selling their services when I'm out shopping, I can say I'm with Utility Warehouse and they immediately back off! Hurray! I'm happy with UW and I won't be looking to change any time soon.
1115|I like the way you can enter the readings for electric and gas readings over the phone. There is always someone on the phone to listen to your queries.
1116|We have been with Utility Warehouse for about 3 years now and have ne reservations in recommending anyone to consider them for their utilities needs.  Also their Customer Service is excellent - and clear and concise.
1117|Having joined the Club at least five years ago, [ have nothing  but praise for it. The original agent has dropped by the wayside but the UW Club continues to fulfill all my requirements
1118|I have been with uwclub for some years and have always found them to be efficient. But I recently moved house and I was disappointed to hear that there would be 2 weeks delay before my phone/broadband could be connected.
1119|NO SOONER THAN I SIGN UP WITH UTILITY WAREHOUSE FOR FREE LANDLINE AND INTERNATIONAL CALLS AND THE FREE CALLS GO AND THE COSTS GO UP AND UP.DESPITE THIS, PHONING FOR HELP IS PROMPT. I HAVE BEEN KEPT WAITING OVER ONE HOUR WITH OTHER ENERGY SUPPLIERS. WELL DONE.
1120|I joined Utility Warehouse last year to benefit from FREE LANDLINE AND INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE CALLS.No sooner than I am signed up, Free Calls are STOPPED, and now even local calls are costing AN ARM AND A LEG. Is Utility Warehouse like everybody else. 'As soon as they have you, they squeeze you for more and more'.I am disappointed, but still recommend you for the prompt response and help given on the 'free'? telephone helpline.
1121|I had problem with the after effects of a lightning strike and found the advise very valuable and was able to reconnect broadband quickly. Tech guy was great and had a lot of patience with a customer who was not particularly competed litterate
1122|happy to be able to communicate with a pleasant and understanding person
1123|I have been a customer of the Utility Warehouse since I moved in my new flat in February this year.Previously I was on a dual fuel and electricity monthly direct debit deal with British Gas.I first thought about switching the pre-paid meter to a conventional one as I thought it would be an added fuss to having to remember to top up the card but there are pay points (normally in corner shops) everywhere.I have found that the pre-paid meter runs waaaaaay cheaper than the BG deal for gas, I think I have spend less than GBP80 since March!This is for a two bedroom flat with a large kitchen/dinner area (over 10sq feet), in total we have 8 radiators and we use the gas for hot baths/showers and cooking stove daily.Besides, the customer service from the UW so far has been really good, and I mean really good, dedicated, friendly and hassle free.Based on my experience I would thoroughly recommend them.We also have the electricity with them and is also cheaper than BG.
1124|When contacting Utility Warehouse last week I was treated extremely professionally.  I was in a pretty distressed state regarding repeated abusive phone calls and the person I spoke to was sincerely concerned and helped me sort things out.  She was clear, patient and gave me excellent guidelines to follow.  She took time and I felt incredibly confident as a result of her support.  Thank you again. 
1125|i was searching for a cheap contract phone saw the utility warehouse and was talking to one of there customer care team   i now have my contract phone and electric,gas,and internet all on 1 bill life is so easy with the utility warehouse i would recommend then to anyone 
1126|Just like to say that since I changed to Utility Warehouse I've never looked back! Their customer services are second to non!I've used a few of the other big providers and have been totally fed up with them all! Utility Warehouse are like a breath of fresh air! Long may it continue!
1127|The service of utility warehouse was generally good. We had been with BT for ages with our internet and never had any problems but since changing the internet is ridiculously slow past 5 o clock to the point where I can't download files watch videos or load pages. This can be a real problem for when I need to do work on my laptop.
1128|Since joining Utility Warehouse, we have enjoyed an excellent introduction and a fast efficient response to the few queries we have had. 
1129|Very easy to talk to and helpful in their understanding of my situation, the person I spoke to made me feel at ease and gave me reassurance. 
1130|"if u want all of your house hold utility""s at the best price and inclusive discounts all in one bill here is the place."
1131|A query about my transfer billing was swiftly and efficiently dealt with. So different to my former supplier.
1132|My phone call was answered quickly -no hanging on listening to tinny music - by an operator who couldn't have been more polite and keen to sort out my issues which she did efficiently and cheerfully -well done and a refreshing change from most call responses.
1133|phoned up about a fault on my internet and the repair was done after a few minuits person on the phone was great .
1134|We phoned about our phone not working. Firstly we went to the person who started us with the company and he dealt with it all. Fast efficient service. No problems at all
1135|I had always used the on-line search engines to make sure my gas and electricity bills stayed as low as possible. Then my son told me about Utility Warehouse. He explained how the more utilities you ask them to provide, the bigger the discount you receive. Switching was easy, Utility warehouse provide my gas, electric, telephone and broadband and I saved about GBP30 a month. I don't think there is anything I don't like about the service and I'm now looking into how much I could save if I switch to the mobile phone service too 
1136|"My name is Christopher and I have been with The Utility Warehouse for many years. What always gives me great satisfaction is when I'm stopped at my local super market by a rival energy supplier and they ask me who I'm with and I tell them ""The utility warehouse"" they say""sorry we can not compete."
1137|Really good experience - the local rep who signed me up helped all the way through the transfer process and is always available to respond to any questions.  Phone calls to the call centre are always dealt with promptly and efficiently, and if the issue has been complicated or been delayed for any reason I have always been kept informed of progress.
1138|I have been with Utility Warehouse for quite a while and will remain with them because of their customer service. They don't leave you waiting for ages on the end of the phone and actually have people answering the phone who seem to have the authority to sort problems without passing you on endlessly to other people.
1139|"I have been a customer of Utilit Warehouse for 2 years and had no problems until a few weeks ago.My Blackberry that I had on contract had stoppped working, battery depleted. I called to see if it coud be fixed and they said that as my contract was due up for renewal in a month, I might as well upgrade. i asked about an I phone and the guy said that I coud have one but in his opionion the Samsung Galaxy is a better phone. I agreed to go with his recommendation as I don't know much about phones and just wanted to pay the same amount of money each month that I was paying for my Blackberry.He said I could have the Galaxy S4 for the price i was currently paying.The phone arived and when I opened it, I discovered it was an S5, not the S4 I had ordered. I called UW and asked if this woud be the same price we had discussed and was told no it woud be more. I said I didnt agree to an S5 so can you send me the phone I asked for. They said they would need to listen to the sales call to make sure I had asked for the S4! They agreed it was their mistake and would send mre the S4. At that point I said I woud actually prefer the I phone 4 instead and they said that was fine. They agreed to send out my I phone and all I had to do was give the courier the Samsung S5 in return.All was fine until 3 days after getting my Iphone, the phone stopped working. I called to UW to ask why and they said I had been""blacklisted"". When I asked what for they said that the Samsung Galaxy S5 I had sent back, had been recieved b them but it was water damaged and beyond repair. They also said that the IMEI numbers on the phone did not match the one thay had sent me, thereby suggesting that I had swapped the handset they sent me for a faulty replacement. Numerours phone calls and emails later, I ws told I had been ""unblacklisted"", i was not financially liable for the phone and they were now conducting an investigation with the police, the courier and their own warehouse depot. I thought that was the end of the matter until I received a text message from them yesterday to say that my delivery has been dispatched. I called them to say I am not expecting anything from you, only to be told that after conducting their ""investigation"" they are certain that no third party could have been involved and i therefore was once again the major suspect!I have called them repeatedly and everyone you speak to has no idea of wha the other person has said, to say they are grossly incompetent is putting it mildly. The fact that they would blame their customer of stealing a phone instead of looking closer at the courier and warehouse staff is beyond my comprehension. I refused to sign for the phone they sent me back and have asked for a chief executive to call me back within the hour and that was 4 hours ago. I will be going to my Citizens Advice Bureaux about this matter but wanted to warn people about their appalling customer service."
1140|I have made use of the Utility Warehouse for several years and have found the service excellent.  Queries are answered promptly and helpfully. IT support is particularly good. As a result I have arranged for UW Club to take on our local community centre and am considering introducing them to another site.
1141|I have only recently joined U. W. having moved into a new (to us) house.I wanted to take over all the previous occupiers services, gas, electricity and Internet. However the internet take over it seems could not be done seamlessly, and I had little help from the U.W. advisor on the subject. I took the gas and Electric, and signed up for another provider for internet. As it turned out, despite assurances that it would be an easy quick job, it took the best part of 4 weeks to get connected. It maybe the UK system which is ponderous and inflexible, and I may have been better to stay with U.W. but in the light of little or no advise at the time, I chose to use another provider. When the current contract comes to an end, I intend to talk to U.W. to see if I can change back relatively seamlessly, and if so I will. Here's hoping. Dennis Flanagan
1142|Being a Senior Citizen now and for the last three years also having been with Utility Warehouse for nearly eight years following a U -Switch search I find them very fair in most things they deliver although the general price hikes have cost me a fortune in the purchasing of Just for Men but like everything else we tend to ride the storm. I am on the Standard/Value tariff monthly D/D which fair very well alongside my solar panel income,so all in all in comparison to the competition I find very little to winge about and wiil continue as a loyal customer.  
1143|Service on the phone is very good. Very little waiting time, and often straight through to someone who can help. The full package, gas, electricity, phone, mobile and broadband offers a decent discount. The cash card helps with monthly budgeting.
1144|My mobile phone was not charging properly. I sent it to utility warehouse two days shy of one month ago as it was still in warranty. I have had to ring twice to find out what is happening- the first time they said it would be returned within one week - did nt happen. One week later I rang to see what was happening and was told it had been sent to Apple but not quite sure what was happening. I sent an email to U.W. on Wednesday but have had no reply yet (Sunday). Not impressed. 
1145|"I had to ring recently to complain about my ipad reception, after about 10 mins. of following orders I eventually got the reception,.  I have just had the same problem, and on calling ""service"" I am told that you were ""out of hours"".  (Sat. 18.40). What Do I do now?? I presume that when I call on Monday I will be in a queue too long to hold on for.What next? "
1146|"In May I had taken out all my services with utilities warehouse,  I found out that the mobile phone service did not offer me what I was told. A sales rep attended my home and told me they could over me a phone contract using the EE network at a cheaper rate,  he said "" it is a like for like service, you get all the same facilities except you will deal with our award winning customers services"", well it's not and when I pointed it out it took a couple of weeks for their technical team to get involved who then agreed with me that they cannot offer this service that I require, but agreed the information on their system should not be there so they removed it straight away,  they apologised and admitted they could not offer those facilities.  After talking to higher members of staff (Team leaders) they told me there was nothing that could be done as I was over my cooling of period,   that's when I found out there was another facility with the phone that I could not use,  I'm now dealing with the ceo directly but still they want me to buy myself out if I want to leave.I am now in a position to leave this with the ombudsman, the sales rep has backed of and has now denied what he said but if that was the case why send emails/text saying he had escalated my problem to try and resolve this issue. The sales rep had his hand slapped and is now not communicating with me due to now refusing to admit what he said.What I would like to know is there anyone else out there that had a problem with their mobile agreement?"
1147|You had better not have a dispute on your account. If you do their debt collection arm acts like a speeding bullet to rack up unnecessary charges which they then force you to pay. Meanwhile their customer service arm responds at a snail's pace and is incapable of answering more than one point at a time. These two don't seem to talk to each other.They are very polite but totally incompetent.I have four official complaints which I have initiated against them. They have not responded to a single one of them yet.Best of luck if you choose them.Regards,Tim.
1148|You can be confident that all arrangements are correctly set up, and that you will be kept informed of any changes or developmentsIt is easy to contact the utility warehouse, whether on-line or by phone, and you speak to real human beings, without being kept waiting.As a result, you can relax, and know that your account is being managed well.I hope to go on to a more advantageous tariff once I move house and alter telephone arrangements.
1149|The service that I have experienced has been very good , well spoken staff that I can understand . The help I have received has been responded to and queries resolved quickly .
1150|Not sure of price & put me on hold other wise he was first class.
1151|Very helpfull  when we moved home . I would recommend them for all their services
1152|I have been with Utility Warehouse for twelve months and would not hesitate to recommend them. I am paying less for my utilities now than I have paid for years and I am getting rewards for recommending them! Fantastic customer service whenever I have had to speak to them. I can't think of anything to complain about, it's a no brainer. First class.
1153|I wanted to include the internet on my phone. One quick call was all it took just provided a few simple details and the internet for my phone was instant great service and a pleasant lady on the other end of the phone -easy to understand
1154|I have a health problem and need to have medical supplies which are kept in a medical fridge, I rang to request that I be put on your priority list as per advice given to me by my nurse's, to ensure that should power fail, that Utility Warehouse would ensure supply would be returned to me asap.  Your staff member could not have been more helpful, she asked all questions pertinent to my query and even checked with another member of staff to make sure that she was doing her best for me.  What fantastic service, this was all done in a friendly professional manner, well done to her.Many thanks for your kind help and assistance.
1155|We had a fault on our telephone line. It was dealt with speedily and efficiently.
1156|Very good customer service and always  very polite and helpful. My father is the account holder but has hearing problems. They totally understood and  authorised me to speak in his behalf. The lady I spoke to was very understanding. 
1157|very happy with them BUT the design and layout of the bills are somewhat confusing ... and whoever designed them must have been left-handed as the bills open the wrong way round!!! they should open like a book, with the crease on the LEFT hand side.
1158|up to fairly recent got quite a lot of telephone calls free.Now they are no longer free, and have to upgrade my package, ort pay connection charges
1159|I have been using Utilities Warehouse for some time now and I find their prices OK, although sometimes the changes made to their billing system is not always clear.    It took a while to get my SVP panel account set up and working but that seems OK now.  However it would be nice to be able to register the readings on-line, not possible at the moment as I have a larger than standard system.   I would like to take advantage of their multiple account discount but as we do not have gas in this area this somewhat limits my choice.
1160|Replaced within a week with out a problem, Easy to fit into incoming phone line.
1161|I have been most impressed on the whole with Utility Warehouse my only grumble has been my inability to actually speak to someone as I had a query and found it impossible to speak to anyone due to the volume of calls every time I have phoned.  I gave up which has resulted me not using the cashback card anymore.In the past when I have got through to technical people in the beginning for my mobile they were excellent.
1162|I have lost count of the number of years I have been using this company. Even when I had financial problems and appeared to be messing them about they were patient and courteous.Everything is straightforward. The staff are helpful and deal with the situation in hand.
1163|Needed a new phone-line and broadband installed and was given a quick and efficient service.   Advisor was helpful and efficient. 
1164|I am very pleased that we chose utility warehouse as our energy supplier they keep in constent contact and have recently identified that my electric meter is not working properly and that i have probably been paying too much.  They also confirmed that would be fitting a new meter in a the near future.  So thankyou very much.
1165|We have been with Utility Warehouse since May, 2004 and found the company good to deal with and having compared prices and services elsewhere believe we are getting a competitive package. One aspect of dealing with UWDC is that you can speak to someone quickly and directly if you have a concern and this is dealt with efficiently and in a friendly manner.Having dealt with some of the bigger suppliers we do not feel the level of service is as good and there is not the added advantage of UWDC club offers.We have no hesitation in recommending Utility Warehouse to friends and family.
1166|FIRST TIME I DEALT WITH YOU AND IT WENT VERY WELL
1167|As well as saving costs on energy and telecoms we use the cashback card which saves us a few hundred pounds every year on our shopping! It took a while for the real benefits of the cashback card to sink in and we were slow on getting to use it. Wish we'd realised sooner - especially for online shopping. Also the company have really helpful customer support.
1168|UW club is great! You can have all your utilities together and get one bill. It is quite easy to save money. Prices are competitive for gas, electricity, broadband and home phone which I use. Advice and help is a free call away and waiting time for connection to a British call centre is short. Quibbles? Very few but perhaps a tad more info when partners on their very useful cashback card change. I recently had the experience of not getting cashback on a fairly large purchase because a few days earlier this partner had ceased to be a partner. But, when I rang up to query this I was given a cashback as a matter of goodwill. Great service!
1169|I've been with Utilities Warehouse for several years buying Electricity, Phone, Broadband. The product is great, and the cost seems good overall. There are some deals which appear better from time to time, but overall I can highly recommend UW. The more you put with them the better the deal. 
1170|We are concerned about the continued increase in bills and feel that there should be much better communication to try and improve them.
1171|i like the accurate bills,my representative reminds me every month to provide a meter reading which keeps my bill accurate for my usage. the bill format is easy to understand. i don't like the fact that when my meter needs to be read they always arrive during the daytime when i am at work,a convenient time should be arranged to ensure nobody wastes their time
1172|My 85yr old father was lured into a tariff of GBP21.99 / month but has actually been set bat GBP1300 since October. The Ombudsman is about to take the case up.
1173|Queries are always answered swiftly. Customer care is excellent. We still feel after four years that we are getting value for money
1174|Till present,U.W. are the best I.P. I have found! I can now relax knowing I am getting what I pay for, consistently steady service, no dropped connections,speed or standards.In one word: Reliable.Sincerely,J.B.
1175|been a customer for 2 years , always payed dd on time every month , upgraded 1/2 way through to inc phone + broadband . aprox bill GBP120 pm . i never had a problem dealing with them , even recommeded to my friends. when i joined i assured they gave me a saving on both gas , elec. my bill has been cheaper than all my friends untill i realised i hadnt EVER had a paper bill ! i phoned and requested at least 3 times this year[ into my 3rd yaer with company ], in may my 1st bill came showing a GBP900 aprox debt with gas !! i was NEVER NOTIFIED of this , always giving meter reading every 3 months at least , all they had to do was write to me and let me increse my dd. but they had no intention of this , I have now left and now paying bill elsewere and paying off a huge debt , i cant afford they know i was a single mum on a budged plan NEVER USE THEM AGIAN  
1176|This is the worst company I have ever had dealings with. They fail to meet their promises and are totally very difficult to deal with. I would advise all people to keep away.
1177|I was kept informed all the time of when the delivery would be.
1178|Having initially been semi-strong armed into switching to gas and electric with Utility Warehouse on the basis that the cash back card rewards would basically cancel any gas/electric charges and we would get everything for free (!), the sales person neglected to mention any of the charges:GBP1 for having each card (no mention of this when you apply for sibling card)GBP.35 for EACH top up!! Again, no mention of this by the sales people and it isn't on their billit just turned up on our bank statement.We spend a lot at Sainsburys so thought it would be worthwhile however you have two choices:1. Do a massive top up to avoid spending 35p four times a month, thus you have just given UW GBP800 of your cash (unprotected and unsecured in the event of an insolvency) and have to pay 35p for the privilege2. Top up small amounts often, negating any benefit.RIP OFF and so so cross that we switched. Even more annoying is when we signed up for the cards, I specifically asked if there were any charges and was told that no, it is literally like spending money off your debit card. The least transparent company model I have ever encountered - it is almost criminal. I am appalled by Utility Warehouse's cashback scheme
1179|I'd be very careful signing up with this company as they sound initially brilliant the cashback card sounds great but actually there are a lot of exclusion criteria is and there is also a hidden charges on being told that we had no contract we were able to leave whenever we felt we were then told are leaving there would be an admin charge and a charge for the router which we were never told about so I'll be a bit cautious and I they are not the cheapest their Internet is got very poor connection and is a lot slower than the sky which we just signed back up to so I'd be cautious
1180|Utility warehouse promise you the earth then they rescind on their promises. Their lack of customer service stinks, they send out extortionate electric & gas bills for summer months. They don't answer emails, put the phone down on customers and generally ignorant. I would sincerely advise that no one bothers purchasing utilities from this company. I regret the day I went to utility warehouse for my gas and electric. There is absolutely no pleasantries to say about this company.Please,please any potential customers think twice before going to utility warehouse. I'm leaving this rotten company as soon as I can, DONT bother wasting your time. 
1181|Took over the account when I moved house but was not happy with their charges so asked for a final bill, this I settled and changed supplier. About 4 months later I received a further bill which I disputed as I had closed the account but they were sure that I owed it and the next thing I knew was a call from a debt collector. I have never owed money to anyone.I would not use this company again due to their bully tactics. 
1182|I like the consistency of UW's service. Also the clarity of the billing process. The prices are not bad either. 
1183| am an O.A.P. and have difficulty understanding what is explained, however the gentleman who dealt with was understanding and helpful, giving me the information I required in simple terms.A good service which I pass on to my friends as and when I can.
1184|My only negative comment is about the lenght of time I had to wait to speak with someone. the technical assistant was helpful, understanding that I was nor a technical wizard polite and patient.many thanks
1185|AGENT EFFICIENT AND HELPFUL AS HE LISTENED CAREFULLY TO MY ISSUE AND GAVE GOOD ADVICE.
1186|It was quick and easy to change ownership of a property without all the correct account numbers and info to hand, great help from customer services who happily found all the correct details and has transferred all our details over, in a painless fashion.one less thing to worry about when you move house.Huge thanks to Utility Warehouse.
1187|Call centre based in UK and staff  speak good understandable English are always pleasant, polite and helpful  Regular bills which are clear and prices very competitive.  Overall excellent
1188|Definitely the cheapest on the market for your utilities. We switched from two different companies who provided our phone/broadband and gas/electric to 'Utility Warehouse' and saved a packet each month. It's great to be able to have one company supply all your utility needs with such excellent value and excellent service, I also like the fact you have one bill for your utilities. I have recommended Utility Warehouse to family and friends and they are impressed with the value you get. The only negative comment I have is that the standard broadband speed is too slow if you use a lot of internet but hey, nothings perfect. If you think you are paying too much money for your utilities, I recommend you look into changing to Utility Warehouse and see how much you can save. 
1189|"I was a Utility Warehouse customer on 2 properties. The first was for the period 01/05/2012 to 30/04/2013. We settled that bill in May 2013 and started using them for the ""new"" property. In January 2014 an amount of 294.13 was taken out of my account. I thought it was an adjustment due to a meter reading i had given through for the second property. I have now moved from the second property and on receiving my final bill I saw that the 294.13 was not credited against this account.When querying it i was told that the 294.13 was an adjustment for the first property due to the readings for day and night being mixed up. The problem i have is 2 fold. 1 they adjusted the account 9 months after we had left the property and it is a year later. How can I dispute this. The second and more worrying issue is the fact that they just took the money out of my account without explaining to me. I have also had endless trouble trying to have my details updated. I would suggest you stay away from Utility Warehouse at all costs."
1190|I'll start by stating that I have been a long time UW customer, and to be honest, I have never had any real problems with them, until the last year.We moved house in February 2013, and I transferred my UW account for gas and electricity to the new property.  During the first 12 months of ownership I was paying c GBP115 per month combined, but in March 2014 I recieved a letter stating that I had used c GBP900 more electricity than the cGBP800 that I had paid for, and as a result my monthly bills for gas an electric have gone up to GBP270 per month.There are only two of us in the house and my neighbours (generally families of 4 or 5) use approximately GBP800 - GBP1,000 of electricity per year, compared to my GBP1,700. They say that they took a meter reading in July, so I can only assume that if I had been billed correctly up to August 2013, that this GBP900 deficit had been accrued in a 6 month period (although their small print does say that if the meter reader takes the wrong details, it's still our fault).I genuinely have no idea how I can have used so much electricty, and it takes weeks to get any answers from them.  Their customer service is one of the worst I have ever encountered, and my last email remains unanswered after 8 days.  (Their average response time appears to be about 8 days, but they never answer your questions when they do finally get round to responding).Until 3 months ago I would have actually recommended these people, but after this, I wouldn't wish them on my arch enemies.Next stop a complaint to the regulatory body.
1191|"I have had nothing but trouble since joining the ""club"". My broadband speed runs at an almost constant 2.5mb/s. No reasonable attempt on warehouse's behalf to correct it. I feel the whole package was miss sold. I was told by the rep that my orange phone would swap over automatically, where in fact It took an 80 mile round trip to get my phone unlocked, all at my expense. Phone works sporadically at best. I have spoken to people on the phone who seem incapable of making a decision, let alone being able to use any common sense.  All in all I am left at a loss. How can companies operate with such a disregard for their customers?"
1192|"One word ""Rubbish"".  I will never use again. They don't know what they are doing? Just get commission and sending collection people for no reason. "
1193|Excelent customer service. Answered quickly, listend and explained properly.
1194|Been with uw for a few years now service has been excellent started with gas n electric 2 years ago we added phone n broadband now In process of adding mobile I love all services on one bill always clear if I have had to contact customer services always polite n helpful have rated 4 stars because I think that even the best can improve as an example had a big problem wit current mobile supplier was talked through all choices including staying we're I was have had time to process because no pressure from uw great service
1195|I like the fact that you get a personal visit from one of the members to go over the best possible package for you. Nothing is too much trouble, and they help you to get all the information you need to change providers.  I have saved considerable money since moving to the discount warehouse and would and have recommend to anyone to join this great service.
1196|Utility Warehouse were able to provide us with the advice other companies had not given us regarding our new printer and problems setting it up on line. They then supplied us with a new router very quickly.
1197|Great to know that there are very helpful staff who can see you through the whole process, not having to wait on the phone and be put through to varies sections without any resolution.Have already recommended you to family and my sister is now looking into joining you hopefully very soon as I have told her the positive way in which I have always found you to be. The services are very good and I have always been very happy with any help I have asked for.It is just nice to know that if you need to know anything about the services offered that the staff are there without not having to wait too long and you also have the peace of mind as a bonus that the call will cost nothing.
1198|Very helful and very good customer experience!
1199|U/WAREHOUSE IS VERY GOOD ON HELPPING YOU.WE HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE.WHEN WE HAVE PHONED THEM UP.THE STAFF ARE VERY HELPFULL.THANK YOU.
1200|The general alround service is very good. However when ever I have phoned customer service I have alway felt that that the agent at the other end as understood what need sorting. As of now this as alway been done at a very speedy rate. It's great to speck to people that also speck English. Because some time overseas agents may be able to speck England but get lost with regional sying.
1201|Switched to UW when we moved from a 2 bed house to a 1 bed house. We thought UW would be cheaper but they turned out to be more expensive. We have had huge bills. We are now paying more for our 1 bed house than we were for the 2 bed house. EON are cheaper than this company and that is saying something. I am now in the process of contacting the Ombudsman.I also do not like the fact they get their own employees to write good reviews.Avoid this company. I am going to try EBICO.
1202|Energy prices and telecoms are all much of a muchness, but when you buy everything from Utility Warehouse, you not only have to deal with just the one supplier, you get great tariffs and the opportunity to have the UW Cashback Card, the best kept secret on the market!  For buying stuff you buy anyway (especially good if you are a Sainsburys shopper), like groceries, petrol, clothes, meals out, car stuff, household goods, if you preload your cashback card with your money and buy from that accountant rather than via your bank account, you earn tons of discount of your UW bill.  I get about GBP30 a month off for my regular spend at Sainsburys (GBP130 pw groceries, GBP35 pw petrol).  If I buy anything from anywhere else, including ebay/paypal, I always try to use my cashback card to bag even more cashback.  When I moved into this house, UW brought in a new landline, connected my broadband, changed electricity and gas suppliers from the one set up, all done quickly and efficiently.  I even have a budget plan for my energy.  I have to move again soon and I've only had to make one phone call to sort out all that lot.  Highly recommend UW, especially my distributor Bryan Hoare.
1203|I have had little problems if I have had to contact this company. Problems have been sorted out efficiently.I have used this company for 10 years now, so I think that shows my feelings towards it.
1204|One of the best decisions I have made was to switch to Utility Warehouse. The changeover for all utilities was dealt with smoothly and professionally and the layout of the bills is the clearest I have ever come across in my experience of a number of utility providers. Telephone support is excellent and I would recommend this company without hesitation.
1205|We find that U.W. give us a fair price compared to some other companies.The service seems to be efficient in the way it does business.On the occasions that we have had to contact U.W. we have been treated with a friendly helpful manner,
1206|I've had nothing but problems since day one! I will never use them again and recommend no one else does. The customer service is appalling. I have had 4 problems with them and not 1 was resolved. The staff aren't trained and are always telling you the wrong thing. The prices are extortionate and once I gave my meter reading they tripled my prices. I was also told by a distributer that I was in a rolling monthly contract, and when I phoned to cancel I was told I was signed into a 24 month contact and had to pay very high prices to cancel. Avoid avoid avoid!
1207|This company seems to think they can collect a previous shop tenants debt from new tenant despite having legal letters telling them of change of tenancy. They are absolutely disgusting send numerous letters threatening court action for a bill before my time. Don't respond to complaints customer service worst I have ever come accross. OFGEM sort these fools out, I am not the only shop this is happening to either. Avoid and go direct you will get it cheaper. The other shop has gone though the same process their previous tenant went into liquidation however, these idiots don't understand that new companies are not responsible for others debt.
1208|I have tried to look for a cheaper supplier and there isn't one. Customer service is ok. Would recommend to friends and family. I have been with the Company for 4 years and have no intention of changing in the near future.
1209|"We are very disappointed at the recent service we have received which we have found profoundly misleading not to say dishonest. You are hiding a 37% increase in gas charges. How? By sending out an April bill for GBP105.33 (Our gas bill was GBP53 from April to December 2013 and GBP59.85 for January - March 2014.) You overcharge us by nearly GBP50, then offer to ""spread the credit balance you (Utility Warehouse) need to pay back"" to us over 10 month giving you the use of our money on top of the 37.7% increase. Very sneaky!  This clever device you said would apply ""to all customers affected"" so we were clearly not an isolated case.We would like you to repay instantly in full the amount you overcharged us. We will then adjust the direct debit for future payments. This is the second change in our membership which has left us getting much less service for higher charges. The terms of our  Gold plus membership were altered depriving us of the telephone service we previously had. These alterations appeared to be sold as a way of avoiding high gas prices. Very short lived. How can you justify a 37% increase in gas prices?There seems to be a discernible change of ethos in your organisation? Perhaps a change in management team? From a customer perspective I am not impressed. You have lost our trust and we will now actively be seeking to switch all our services.  "
1210|I have never been signed up with a supplier so competitively priced!I don't usually write reviews but this is one I felt I shouldn't miss.Everybody out there should be with this company, & forget all the others. The staff are friendly & polite, & nothing you ask is too much trouble for them. My son recommended them to me, & I haven't looked back. Wish I'd known about them years ago, as I could have saved myself a small fortune...........can't fault them with anything.
1211|The one thing that I really love about utility warehouse is that when you need to speak to someone you actually get to speak to a human and not automated system.  This makes all the difference when you need to get help, no stressful calls just real help. Also I have to say the staff are very friendly and will do everything they can to make a stressful situation easier. I would highly recommend utility warehouse as your main gas and electric provider.  I would never change to any other provider. 
1212|I was recommended these by family and I found switching to be very straight forward, I just went online and filled out the form.  Once switched they like you to give a meter reading on the last day of each month, no letters/emails asking for one.  I found this easy enough to deal with as it just becomes routine and easy to remember.Payments are made by direct debit and they review your bill annually (I think) but if you require a change of payment, up or down, then that is easy enough to do, their customer services is a free phone number.Any questions I've had with my bill have been sorted out in a straight forward manner.  Customer service reps on the phone are really friendly and very helpful.I took out gas and electricity with them, but other services are on offer and as I understand, the more you take out, the bigger the discounts.
1213|It takes too long to get through to a human being.  Once through, thye service is very good.
1214|I  switched to Utility Warehouse from advice off a family member.My bills had shot up with my previous suppliers and I really did not know what to do.The Representative that came to see me was very good, explained things in great detail and made me feel comfortable.On listening to the Representative's advice to me my partner also switched.We now have our gas, electricity and phone all in one.Plus my family member received a Marks and Spencer voucher for her part in recommending you to us.  
1215|My email saying I was moving house was not noticed or acted on, unfortunately. This has meant we have no landline, no internet and hence working from home is impossible and we feel uncontactable. This is causing major inconvenience and we hope UW are going to put things as they should be as soon as possible. Although you can never talk to the same helpline person twice, the advisers are UK based and with good knowledge; so to be told 'there's too many emails and not enough staff to read them' was a disappointment, especially with the delay we now face. Looking forward to reconnection!
1216|I have always found the customer service pleasent and polite and quick to grasp any queries I have made. And yes I have recommended them to a number of people.
1217|First of all they underestimated your monthly bill eg what I would be paying so I didn't realise I was getting more and more in arrears until after 14 months when they upped my bill. My mobile phone stopped working when their network went down - after several weeks. Despite several hours of trying my laptop won't except the wifi router they provided me at coat they put me on the wrong electricity tarriff costing me GBP180 it's just been dreadful and now I'm indebted to them so that I don't feel like I can leave! 
1218|I was not sure about signing untill I met Gareth Davies the company Rep who made an appointment to meet with me he was on time which is always a good sign. At one point I needed to ask  Gareth to repeat what he had said because I dont always take things in first time, nothing was too much trouble he was happy to tel me again by the end of our appointment I was happy to sign up I was even more happy after 3 month's of using the service for my Gas and Electric and I could see how much money I had saved. I got in touch with Gareth again and made a second appointment for him to call this time I signed up for the Mobile phone offer he told me about at our last meeting the service was very fast to set up Gareth also called me to check if I was happy with the way the phone servcie had been set in place, I informed him I was happy with my new service. I would recommend Utiltywarehouse to anyone 
1219|Do not make the mistake of signing up with this joke of a company.  Expensive, rude and understaffed!
1220|I'm. Not the best when it comes to technology but this guy's patients was superb.  When I couldn't put in code as it was capital alpha and numerical he kept calm and went through everything again with my grandaughter as well until we eventually achieve logging on to internet.
1221|In my experience with Utility Warehouse, whenever I, ve had a problem, the person I, m talking to listens to the problem, which in my opinion is the most important thing they can do as they are working from a blank sheet. I have also found them to be very polite and helpful.  I have been with them for many years and would not change to any other supplier. 
1222|service is very good ad straight forwrd,  queries are handled well and by actual people, only a few selections on the phone key[ad needed but you get a decent, understanding person handling your query who answers questions in plain english and a courtious mannerpoint to note; they ask for a meter reading at the end of every month, i don't mind this as i always know when to read the meter so it saves me being caught out by that
1223|I have always been happy with UW it suits my needs and i know that you always have my interests or more important my pocket at heart.I have had several different companies canvas me on the doorstep for new business with their company, but i always send them away again.I know that you always compare prices all the time and try and get the cheapest value for money.You always let me know if things are going to happen and prepare me well in advance if there are going to be any price rises.My only niggle is trying to get through to you ,the other day i was holding for over 30 minutes, however the person i eventually spoke to was very apologetic and answered my query quickly and efficiently and in a very friendly manner so i couldn't be cross with them for long having explained to me the problems.I am always promoting your company to people i knowKeep up the good work and cheap prices.
1224|From the moment I telephoned Utilities Warehouse my problem was dealt very professionaly  and nothing was too much trouble.  When one of my questions could not be answered I was transferred to another department and the problem was sorted out very promptly. Very friendly people and  was very quick dealing with my inquiry.  Would recommend Utilities to my friends.
1225|the service and  perfection every thing is good and also i recommend my friends so every thing is very good.
1226|I had to contact UW as my card which feeds the UW discount card was about to expire, and I was unable to update it from the website - I was asked for my birthday, and there was nowhere to write it.I explained what was happening to the contact, and was put through to a more appropriate department. Both people I spoke to were really helpful, and the impression was that they were genuinely interested in putting things right.- I could not tell from the options on the phone which one to choose for the website problem.Hopefully the website is fixed.

1228|Pre contact service excellent. Once you sign the contract you are treated in an appalling manner. Probably the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.
1229|I found the person I spoke to was helpful, polite and knowledgeable. I felt as though I was being well looked after by a competent person. This took any pressure and worries away from me and as this is the first time that I have had to organise a utility supplier I found their expertise and guidance extremely reassuring.
1230|I called to explain I wanted to cancel my cashback card as I'm not able to use it enough to warrant the GBP1 per month charge.  The customer service advisor was helpful, polite, clear and easy to understand and the matter was dealt with extremely easily.  There was no pressure from her to keep the card going and she provided straightforward instructions and information on the outstanding balance on the card and how long I had to spend it.Was just a pleasure to receive such pleasant and efficient customer service.
1231|I like the idea of cheaper electricity and I am soon to move house which will have gas heating which I am sure will be cheaper than the oil I am now using, also presumably it won't run out, which is what I am always concerned about with my oil tank.
1232|The Rep who came to see  me was very knolagable and informative in all the products i was asking about and extremely very patient (as i am a silver surfer just learnjng and not very tachnically minded . What ever my dealings with Utillity Warehouse have always been excellent and have always recommended them.   please let me know where and when the party is !!!!!
1233|I wanted to change my telephone tariff to include a monthly payment for all calls since it would be cheaper foe me. I had tried to contact you earlier but could not access you. Your advisor chaged it as requested then backdated the change to 1st Feb. Lovely, thanks!
1234|Apart from one initial slip up U/W have been most helpful and their technical people were really good. Well done lads and lassies.
1235|Since switching my electricity supply to Utility Warehouse 8 months ago I haven't looked back. My previous supplier gave incorrect opening readings but UW sorted it - in may favour too which meant I recieved a cheque from the other supplier. The call in service for metre readings is quick and easy (no need to remember pass words or codes) just call from your tel no. After clearing up the confusion about my opening readings and seeing my pattern of usage my monthly payments were recently lowered by GBP15. I now pay almost half of what my other supplier was proposing I should pay. When I've called I've found staff to be knowledgeable, courteous and helpful. So far the proof is in the pudding and I will consider using other services in the future. For the first time in a long time I feel as though they are watching my back not the other way around. It's refreshing to be recieving an honest and reliable service at a fare price. I'm a customer for life. 
1236|"Eventually got my code but still can't make calls. Your staff don't seem to understand that there are still people that need step by step guidance.I decided to take this phone to keep up with new technology but am beginning to regret it . Where can I get a proper guide to help !In the meantime I have to borrow my partners ""simple"" phone !!! "
1237|Over the years I have been pleased with the services of Gas and Electricity supplied by your company. Your phone in meter reading service is quick and easy to do. I have never had a service issue, it has always been very goodHowever I have very recently had solar panels fitted and your feedintariff department are not up to the standard I would have expected from your company. So much so I am considering changing provider over this one issue as the help I received was so out of order once it is eventually brought on line.
1238|Having been customers of Utility Warehouse for a number of years, I would like to say how easy they are to deal with. Their bills are quite easy to understand and they adjust your monthly amounts up or down by an amount agreed by yourself until the amount is just right. When you call them they are very polite and have always been extremely helpful and able to answer all questions quickly and concisely. I contacted them recently as we will be moving house in a few weeks time and the person I spoke to could not have been more helpful. I cannot say for sure if they are cheaper than other companies, but I am happy with what we are charged and have no desire to change supplier.
1239|The UW assistant was very helpful, professional and knowledgeable.  Problem resolved in a matter of seconds even though I had only been a UW customer for 5 days.  Great confidence builder and I ;look forward to many years of being a UW customer
1240|I have been with Utility Warehouse since we moved in to our property three years ago and must say their prices, customer service and efficiency are fantastic! Paperless bills means we are doing our bit for the environment, whilst still receiving everything we need to keep track of our energy on a monthly basis and the Customer Service Advsiors I have spoken to for various reasons have always been extremely happy and helpful.I have received good advice about how to bring my energy bills down, my meter reading reminders and checks have meant I haven't got in to problems with my bills and have in fact received credit back an dmost importantly this is an energy provider I feel I can trust! 
1241|you got me to change saying my bills would be less, and now you just put them up to what ever you want with no customer consultation and don't ask me if I can afford it!
1242|Have been with UW for many years and its good to know that they shop around for the best deals and adjust tariffs accordingly. Great IT technical support too. Only moved off their broadband service to get BT sport free from BT. Am still a happy customer for gas and electric
1243|I was with UW because I had a six month contract on a flat and this was what the landlords used so I kept them on.  I didn't set up a DD because I was only there for six months.  They have no way to pay by internet so I was happy to pay by phone. Only I could never get ahold of them.  20-40 minutes here and there of being on hold.  Honestly, I don't have that kind of time.  They have an automated system but this only comes on out of hours.  This time, I called and after being put on hold for 5 mins, there was an automated response saying they were conducting a fire alarm and no one could answer the phone and was cut off.  Would not recommend this company.  Terrible. And one of the highest tariffs around ... Avoid at all cost
1244| over to them with out my knolage i had been paying another company for nearly two year with i was more than happy with and way after 4 months of telephone calls uw wins my meter yet because I've been paying some one else i owe then 500+ not that it was my fault ! So I have a meter with gas card and the debt is on there i rand them as they were taking alot out of our 25 a week budget for gas an leaving us with none I rang they did reduce it a little how ever I've had a new meter now witch it broke on a Saturday and I was unable to get some one out till Monday cos surprise surprise this company has no emergency out of hours number if I need to talk to some one I just have to wait with no heating or hot water any way the meter broke a day after putting 20 on I ring them once it's fixed and I a mother 2 4 kids have been told over a week to get that credit back at all if they can see it on there system ! Had a new card for meter delivered and it's put meter back on to paying full debt and a bit more I think as we put 30 on new card and was gone over night 30 bloody quid !! As soon as I can get away from this company the better were acculey considering not using the gas at all and just putting extra on electric to heat water ! To top all this off were currently on a 2 month jsa sanction our main income for 2 months is gone ! I will be ringing them first thing recored phone call as I've been advised by ofgem as this company's practise isn't good enough by far ! To add to this my meter has displayed the call help message while I was on the phone to them so I'm having a new meter put in in the next four hours they say I have asked about the 50 I've put on in the week in to there faulty meter witch was seen by an engineer at the beginning of this week as the call help sign appeared last week end too I've been told I must of used it and I wont see a penny of it I explained our money situation and still nothing im awaiting a phone call Monday morning from the manager but I don't hold out much 
1245|Easy to get through on the phone, contact via email and text. Arrived on time, delivery men very helpful. Overall service excellent will definitely use again
1246|Overall I am very pleased, but I had my Router delivered on Saturday when I was out and I came home to find that the person delivering this item had broken my letterbox on my door.  I came home to find the opener on the ground, I am not very happy about this, and the router had a notice on it to say 'Please push through letterbox' obviously the postman struggled (the packaging shows signs of struggle) but kept on pushing and finally broke my letterbox.  I would have thought that common sense would prevail.  I am in the process of trying to get this sorted out but am not holding out much hope.  I know it is not your fault but somebody has to be responsible for this.  I will be making some more phone calls tomorrow to try and resolve this problem.  Also because the router dropped onto the floor having been forced through the letterbox, will the router still work?
1247|Great helpful friendly telephone assistants
1248|Spoke t.o an excellent agent yesterday and arranged to pay money off my debt today.Spent 10 minutes waiting to do so only to be told after i need to ring another number..annoyingSpoke to a guy about paying and found him very miserable!I KNOW I OWE MONEY AND I AM PAYING IT DONT NEED REMINDING
1249|I have been a very happy customer now for about 12 months. The service I receive is fantastic. I love that all my services are on bill every month and it is way cheaper that what I was paying previously. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending utility warehouse to everyone I know. keep up the great works.  
1250|I have been with go-plus or Utility Warehouse for around 15 years and have saved so much money, but not only that - I have the assurance and confidence of a brilliant team of advisors who have looked after my energy bills, broadband, landline, mobile............. need I say more ?  only one occasion I found a less than friendly advisor, but all the rest have been superb.  thank you.
1251|We went off the phone 20/2/14 at 11.30 ish,its now 21/2/14 14.11 and still no land line,surely when we are still paying line fee's you should push BT harder to repair the fault.
1252|my pre-paid meter said call help when I put my gas card in, I made a phone call first thing in the morning, it was sorted within 2 hrs, & a new card the following morning, I'm more than pleased with the service, we were up and running with gas in less than 2 hrs.
1253|Called about adding more services, namely telephone & broadband but seems they're not as competitive as they used to be. They can't get anywhere near my my current service provider on price, plus UW want to charge for the insallation. Shame really as I've been with UW for years. I really did hope to be pleasantly surprised and thought they'd be able to make me an offer I couldn't refuse. Time for me to check around some comparison site to see if I'm getting the best deal on my domestic energy supply too!:-(
1254|"Was really pleased with the excellent personal service I got from my UW representative. Not pushy and fully explained everything and made switching easy and painless.  So nice to deal with a physical person for a chsnge. The switch was trouble free and happened flawlessly. I was kept fully informed and updated. Submitting meter readings is easy online but I would like to see an iPhone and iPad app as I do miss this having switched from my previous supplier who have an excellent app. I like the online shopping discounts and discount card though.  That's a bonus. I am getting used to using this and clocking up quite a bit of cash back. I've phoned customer services just once. Having a UK based call centre greatly influenced my decision to change. I no longer deal with companies who do not have UK based customer services. The service I received was excellent but I did have to wait 20 minutes to speak to someone which was poor and unacceptable. Otherwise I would have awarded 5 stars. Being ""busy"" is just an excuse. Sufficient staff should be employed for ""busy"" periods.   I have been overall very pleased though and have recommended my elderly father who now saves over GBP100 a month on all of the services as he took the lot.  He is on a limited pension so this was a massive saving for him.  Several friends I have also recommended have switched to UW via the same representative.  Add an app and improve call answering times and I will happily award 5 stars. "
1255|I highly impressed with your service and I was happy to introduce three of my friends to Unility in first year of my contract. I will like 150 call to be free to customers instead been charged any time customers call. Please kindly work on the network because sometimes I do have network failure. 
1256|Utility Warehouse charge customers based on unrealistic estimated bills and pressure customers for an up-front deposit for gas and electricity not yet used if you are not prepared to set up a direct debit.  We supplied meter readings for a rental property we bought and asked for a bill based on usage for the dates we were liable for but received a threatening disconnection letter and could not get UW to accept the dates and readings provided.  The dates provided were governed by the date the property was transferred into our ownership and the date our tenant moved into the property, so are confirmed by legal documents, yet UW disputed them!  Meter readings were supplied by the previous owner and confirmed by us when we bought the property and then provided by our letting agent when the tenant moved in, i.e. provided by a third party, yet again UW disputed them, all to try and charge us for gas and electricity we had not used by basing their bills on (vastly over-estimated) readings.  This is a predatory and cynical company out to exploit any customer it can.  Avoid this company at all costs.
1257|I had a problem with my mobile phone it kept turning itself on and off and in the process discharging the battery.  I rang Utility Warehouse and was guided very patiently by a young man on how to download a programme onto my computer in order to save my contacts and photos before I had to return my phone to factory settings.  I followed his advice and it corrected the problem.
1258|I was impressed with the response time to my call. The staff member was concise in dealing with my questions and also provided additional information without prompting. She was friendly without being over familiar.  An excellent service.
1259|Change to Utility Warehouse after being approached by one of their local representatives. I had seen that UW had had a good rating in Which Magazine. .During the actual change over process they changed their terms and conditions and now I am receiving much higher bills than my previous supplier. Had no response to e mail and no help on the phone (takes hours to get an answer).  Wish I had stayed with previous suppliers, Plusnet, British Gas and Southern Electric. At least they were professional in their dealing with the public.  Big mistakes and waste of my time.   
1260|great value for money, simple and easy to deal with no complications, if only they could get a boiler cover cover plans or plans and that would be great!
1261|We have been members since your early days and enjoyed a very happy relationship. I have tried, and will continue to try, to encourage friends & relatives to use UWClub. Unfortunately,  we are now seriously considering changing our phone/broadband requirements to BT. We are extremely reluctant to do this and would prefer to stay with UWClub. However, we only have two phone sockets and these are very badly situated: one in the hall near front door, & one on the other side of the same wall, in the dining room. No sockets in lounge or bedrooms. For nearly twenty years we have had to put up with wires & extensions throughout the house , up the stairs , across the landing etc,to accommodate our phones & PC (which is upstairs). Now we have changed to Wi-Fi, with the router down stairs & PC upstairs, the long extensions are causing problems with WiFi . We desperately need a phone socket downstairs and as this , I presume is outside your remit, we are considering BT's offer of free ( usually GBP130)  installation of socket with their Broadband package. With recent price changes in all companies, there is now little to choose on price, particularly if we pay the annual line rental up front which reduces the cost to GBP11.75 per month.We will stay with UWClub for our energy and would sincerely regret moving our phone to BT if we decide to do it. After 20 years of accepting badly sited sockets and trailing wire extensions we have had enough and, in spite of our preference for UW , we feel it is time to, at least, think about rectifying the problem.
1262|I have been very pleased up to now but have recently had an unpleasant surprise with the notification of the recent increase in prices.The increase in unit charges is competitive but the nasty shock is the increase in Standing charges.     Taking gas and electricity together is going to add around GBP7 per month to our bill.The Standing charge for electricity has gone up from 9.57p per day to 17.96p per day, which is a 87% increase, well above inflation to say the least. The Standing charge for gas, however, has gone up from 4.17p per day to 17.17p per day, which is a 312% increase, worthy of the Mafia. You have also sneakingly imposed the increases in the middle of the month, making it more difficult to make a comparison.This is most unworthy of you, a blot on your previous good record. 
1263|I had a problem with nuisance calls which over time was getting increasingly worse. I decided to seek help from Utility Warehouse (my service provider)and spoke with a member of the customer services team.  He was very understanding and helpful, we discussed a couple of options and I decided to change my phone number. It was a very easy transaction and was completed really quickly with no problems. I use UW for gas, electric, internet, phone and mobile and I can't fault the quality of service that I get from UW and would definitely recommend to anyone.
1264|Your operator was asked to explain the new GBP2 charge on my accountInitially I was going  to ask for it to be deleted as I am retired but when she explained that It included life cover I decided to keep itWhere can I find details of the cover's inclusions?
1265|Its very good the people are so friendly and helpful
1266|Be warned do not touch them with a barge pole. They are bandits! Signed up with them in june last year and only noticed that they were drawing twice as much as they should have done from the direct debit.When I complained in writing got no reply. I then spoke to the agent who had signed us up and was told that the matter would be corrected on the next month billing ie october.It wasn't and they drew again the same amount that they had been drawing, leaving me in credit with them of more than GBP500. I was then told it would be corrected on the November payment. It wasn't and this time I instructed the bank to return the money and cancelled the direct debit. Not satisfied with what they had done two weeks later they then then tied to draw it through my wife's debit card. Thank fully we were able to claim that back as well. Going through there switchboard system is a nightmare and most calls will take you ten minutes to get through and another ten going through their security before you speak to a different operator and having to explain the whole problem all over. No single operator will ever call you back ! The only redress was to complain again through the agent. I finally received a call back from an officious lady who told me that UW were quite entitled to do what they had done as it was in the small print! I told them that in that case I was cancelling the contract. I returned to scottish power and bt. Both are more reliable and professional and cheaper too! 
1267|After being convinced by my father that UW is the 'best' all round, I cancelled my 4 years t-mobile mobile phone contract and started a new one with UW. Believing it would be cheaper than my GBP26/month unlimited data, 300 mins and unlimited texts deal at t-mobile I changed to UW's middle price plan with 1GB data a month, 300 mins and unlimited texts. I very rarely use my phone for mobile data as i am usually connected to wifi the majority of the time, however after 14 days of this calendar month, UW have barred my phone for mobile data claiming I have used over my allowance. I use an independent app on my iphone called 'Onavo counter' which creates a VPN on my phone that monitors my data usage when I am not connected to wifi. Onavo says I have used 234MB in the last 30 days not the extortianate amount UW are claiming i have. Tried to phone UW to explain and they said 'the app isn't trustworthy', funny they said that, anyone would think they're trying to pull the wool over my eyes. I am so angry with this extremely poor mobile service and general lack of help and rudeness from UW's staff. I am telling anyone who reads this, DO NOT START A MOBILE CONTRACT WITH THESE GUYS. Conveniently they are only contactable over phone too so they can facelessly lie to you whilst your bills rocket up into their account. I'm appalled and will be trying to take this further.
1268|I would not recommend this energy provider if they were the last on earth with a supply.  Not to be trusted - they are extremely expensive once they have reeled you in and only taking more and more of their products will bring your bills back down.  Awful customer service - different answer from everyone you speak to - most can't be bothered and just want you off the phone.  On hold for a long time every time.  If you are with them already check your tariff - it will be your own fault if you are on the wrong one - this company does not accept responsibility for anything they do.  Maybe that's because their changes and charges are done by stealth and never upfront.  Awful pyramid scheme set up to line the pockets of a chosen few.  Avoid at all costs.
1269|Where to start? I sold my house on 10th January 2014 and the house was left vacant since 17th august 2013 when my tenants left the house. But little did I know but they had switched to the utility warehouse back in 2011 (Gasp). So when my tenants left I rang British Gas gave them the meter readings, my forwarding address and asked for a quarterly bill, which is the usual procedure. My house sold in September and took 4 months to finally complete. As the house was vacant there was minor usage GBP17 ish over the time it was empty (5 months). When I handed the keys over on the 10th Jan I found the meters had been removed, the utility warehouse had taken me to court using estimated meter readings and issued a court order. All this comes to GBP795. After numerous protracted phone calls, letters and emails they will not change their ridiculous bill and cannot accept they couldn't even read the meters at the back of my house. See it was vacant and had minor usage! Instead they issued estimated bills, sent final warnings and kept compounding more charges for a tiny little bill! Frankly it's insane, they are just after profit and are abusing their power!
1270|After 10+ years with UW they'r going down the Swanny. Gas and Electric is not cheap and I have never seen the so called double gold discount. Also very disappointed by their recent war-n-peace tome on terms and conditions all in ludicrously small print and drafted by Philadelphian lawyers and all quickly followed up by the charging of land line calls allied to some ridiculous concept of a connection fee. For what; other than some theoretical charge for using a line you already pay for. I've spent some time today reading the 'reviews' and, while it may be the cynic in me, I cannot believe in the light of my experience, the gushing reviews of unadulterated five star brilliance - they're an energy provider for god sake and we're all aware of the energy rip-off. In essence Telecom + are just extending the rip-ff mantra to their services and extracting the Michael from their gullible consumers.
1271|so far so good - still cheaper than most
1272|Utility warehouse are courteous and easy to use.  There is no problem getting through to a person - yes an actual human being.  No pressing lots of numbers to get an automated answer. (gas and electricity)Setting up an account was easy and quick be it with a representitive or online again was quick and easy. My problem was solved even though I was grumpy and was determined to stay grumpy with you the rep made sure she did not give up and continued until I was happy.  I was a little disgruntled that no one called me about my payment as it was the first payment instead I received a nasty letter with a charge.  The reason it hadn't been paid was a mix up of numbers on my sort code..  This could of been rectified with a call instead of receiving a letter that really upset me.  Still all sorted by talking to an actually person.  Still can't get over that. 
1273|We have dealt with Unity Warehouse for some 7 years or so and it works out excellent for us.  The Gas and Electric prices are competitive and if you use the cash back card at Sainsbury, M&S; etc you are reducing your fuel bill all the time with the cash back.  It works well for us and saves us money !!
1274|really easy to move over to utility warehouse.and our bills have drastically reduced
1275|First day of Broadband service I needed help in setting up my router. These days we often make our first call to a help centre concerned about how easy it will be to communicate.I need not have worried, the technical helpline was fantastic and quickly resolved the issue. They even rang me back to check that the broadband was working to my satisfaction.
1276|I have been a dual fuel customer for many years and have been very satisfied with the prices charged.  Proper notice is always given for price changes and these are always reasonable, compared with those made by the big six energy companies.  I have a solar PV system and the small additional payment by UW has been very welcome.  A very good service. 
1277|I switched over to utility service a year ago thinking it gives us some benefits but think i am fooled by the offer. They simply promise you and then they change their mind even without giving  notice to any customers. I had a very poor service with the internet they gave excuses telling it could be due to our website streams. I finally upgraded to infinity but it seems they are only squeezing me out of my money with service being nothing better. Also they started charging me for my landline without notice , they claimed sending out letters which i have never received , i read a review which stated the same, so it seems they are fooling us and trying to only increase bill and not helping out. i would never recommend this terrible network to anyone. Worst service i ever came across. 
1278|We have been with the Utility Warehouse for just over a year now and I have to say, I would never recommend this company to any of my friends/family.We initially took out 4 services with them (gas, electric, phone, Internet) meaning that provided we gave meter readings at certain times during our first year, we were told we'd get 10% back on our yearly bill. I therefore phoned up at the beginning of December only to bee told that this would be in the form of vouchers. We'd never been told this at the time when I argued the point they just said it was illegal to credit our account as we'd initially believed would happen, I'm still however yet to receive our vouchers nearly 2 months later.The Internet connection is extremely poor and is always failing, the only time it ever seems to work is when the weather is fine and so we've been left without Internet access for long periods during the recent windy/rainy weather.We also got our latest bill from them and it was approx GBP40 more than usual. I noticed that we'd been charged for a load of landline calls which must have been a mistake as our deal clearly stated that landline calls were free. I again queried this with them only to find out that they'd changed our deal to free landline calls AFTER 7pm without even telling us that our deal had been changed. They claim to have sent us a letter informing us of this change but I have never received such a letter and have been left feeling completely ripped off.Needless to say I will be switching energy, phone and Internet providers, the service we have received from Utility Warehouse has been nothing short of extremely poor. 
1279|"Three months ago, I would have recommended Utility Warehouse. They had pretty much lived up to everything they had said they would.When it came time to move (leave country, even), I dutifully phoned, gave readings and was told that my phone/internet would be disconnected (I would get a small bill for early-release of contract - okay) as expected and that until the house was sold/rented, I'd just have to give them readings... What they didn't tell me is that I would owe HUGE amounts of money after they did their ""budget plan reconciliation"" which has given me a bill that equates what most people pay for an entire YEAR.  How? I was only with them for 12 months, so this equates to them having under-charged me by over GBP50 per month per utility (so over GBP100/monthly). I guess I understand how they can claim to be the cheapest now - they only charge you 50% of the bill until you want to leave - then they hold you hostage until you pay the other 50%!Furthermore, when I rented out my house, they refused to believe that I was no longer responsible for the bill - despite my tenants showing them the council tax bill. They wanted to give my tenants a pre-payment meter due to my ""outstanding"" charges - and refused to let them switch companies, in violation of CAB-advised standard practice.Now, they're hounding me and threatening me - all because they are greedy so-and-so's.  Guess what? OFGEM will be hearing from me soon."
1280|I am very pleased with all services and I have tried my best to   recommend my friends and neighbours, but they don't seem to be interested. I like the way I get a bill every month it helps me keep track of what I need to pay each month, instead of getting a big bill every three months or more. If I have to get in touch with U W Club every one is most helpful and polite.  
1281|My request to have bill protector taken off my account was actioned without fuss.  I would recommend Utility Warehouse to anybody that wants good value for money and personal service. When contacting customer services at Utility Warehouse they make you feel that you are an important customer not just a number like other service providers.
1282|Have been a customer for nearly 3 years. When I moved home they were fantastic, sorting my switch over very effectively. When ever I have had a tech problem their team are on the ball, able to fix anything that's been wrong. I initially didn't use the cash back card, and I regret that, as now I am making great savings each month. I have 4/5 services ATM and will be changing mobile next month.Couldn't think of being with anyone elseCharlie
1283|We have our gas, electricity and telephone with Utility Warehouse, and have been delighted with the service and money-saving. When we purchased solar panels we have been even more satisfied. Wonderful! Service is second to none, and no other company can compare. When we have door-to-door energy companies touting, they give up when we say who we are with. They cannot give us better.
1284|Great customer service. On my wavelength so feel comfortable
1285|Whenever I have had to contact the UWD I have always found the representatives to be extremely helpful and most of all patient (especially when explaining how my electricity bill was worked out)!! Billing issues have always been sorted quickly and efficiently and its great to get confirmation paperwork by return of post.  On rare occasions when we have had problems with telephone or broadband they too are always sorted quickly.My only negative issue is that I wish the broadband could be a bit quicker and if we do move to another provider, that will be the only reason!
1286|So far, I am very pleased with Everything. Will have to wait for the year to be up before I make up my mindas to how much savings have been made.have not always been happy with the Mobile receptionas it loses the signal quite often.
1287|Thank you again, you are very responsive and easy to talk to to resolve problems.
1288|I have only been with UW for six months and cannot therefore give much of a feedback except to say, so far, I am happy with the service I receive. I find it very helpful and secure to have direct contact with you local representative who, when asked, attends to assist very readily.
1289|GOOD SERVICE. ALL AGENTS/ADVISORS VERY WELL INFORMED,PLEASANT AND PATIENT.
1290|Thank you for the prompt service. I received my new mobile phone in really good time and was connected without any difficulties.
1291|I was recommended to Utility Warehouse by a friend when I moved in 2009 for my gas & electricity and have never thought of changing suppliers as I've been more than satisfied. I like the fact that my bill seems to be lower than other people I've spoken to which means I don't have to go through the trauma of deciding to switch suppliers even though it's allegedly easier now. I phoned this week to have my home phone & broadband switched to Utility Warehouse as my recent suppliers prices have soared over the last 18 months and the bonus for doing this is even more discount, my mobile will be next in line no doubt. I'd also like to comment on how simple it was to get through and how helpful & pleasant they where, asking if there is anything that needs explaining or any other service they can assist me with. I new before I phoned to update that this service has a  good reputation. Keep up the good work Utility Warehouse during these times of hardship.
1292|I had a problem of no internet availability.  This was traced to a battery fault on the BT line.Thanks to UW BNT responded rapidly and fault was rectified as promised within 24 hours.texts kept me informed of progressGood service.
1293|"For few years now I have been fighting off my friends ""pushy"" approach to join ""save me money"", but I finally has to day OK as a return favour. From what she was saying I knew It was not realistic it would save me money but I only did not want to be worse off... I thought I can't loose. I opted in for minimum service which she would be happy with and this was home phone, broadband and mobile. After giving me the selling spin of ( no payment, cancel any time, covering switching cost, guaranteed cheapest) I have ended up with a bill that has doubled to what I was already paying?!?!?!?! ( + a 12 months contract!) I am now struggling to get this service cancelled! I am only grateful I have not transferred my gas & electricity.Word of advice, don't be lazy to shop around you will save yourself more money they UW can ever save you. It is a marketing spin... so much for trusting friendship!!!"
1294|I was a little sceptical when first started but it's great.Good prices beat all previous gas and electric.Love the cash back card and getting money off bill by using it just wish it was a little easier as u have to have the right amount on there and when shopping it's easy to go over, also remembering to top up card. Also like the fact we give meter readings every month so it's updated and don't need to pay for gas or electric that we don't use.
1295|Not sure that we are being offered the best deals available.  Eg. To include TV and multiple iPhones on one account.  All members I speak to are always very helpful.  I would like to know how long my iPhone battery should last and what settings are best for power savings.
1296|We moved to a new home recently whose electricity and gas where provided by Utility Warehouse.  I found the gentleman at the call centre most helpful and efficient in setting up our direct debits straight away and agreeing on the amount to be paid.  I will certainly be contacting them regarding other services they may provide with a view to considering switching if the price is competitive  
1297|I have been with this company for a long time now. You don't really have to check price comparisons often;they have a track record of regularly proving to be one of the most competitive,with a very good customer offer.Whenever there are increases or decreases ( yes decreases )in tariff,Utility Warehouse always provide notice well in advance with no nasty surprises;unlike previous experiences with some of the Big 6 companies.I would recommend this company to my friends and family.
1298|Good advise given. Not pushed into making choices.
1299|Best summarized by saying I am well represented in all the products - hassle-free and efficient.
1300|I have been with Utility Warehouse for some years now and I have been happy with the prices of tariffs - the customer service has been excellent. I have Gas, Electricity, home phone, broadband and a mobile. The bills are very easy to read - I would certainly recommend this company - first Class.
1301|Have been with Utility Warehouse for the past 9 years. Wouldn't use anyone else. They have deals that can't be beaten. Cheaper utilities than all others. They don't pay to go on comparison sites as this uses customer's money. Bills are easy to read and they list all utilities. Easy to contact with a freephone number. Everyone is easy to talk to and answer any questions.Join them as soon as possible and you won't be disappointed.
1302|One utilities bill and all at the best price, electricity, gas, phone, broadband and mobile. In addition, the club discount card gives great savings  on shopping from a very broad range of retail outlets; we pay the usual retail price to the shop then get the discounts in reductions off that month's utility bill!
1303|My bills have gone down! My service has also gone down, net speed and telephone calls seem to be poor quality, mobile and landline!I was ok about the above.....cheaper bills so overlooked things. Just wonder why a company chasing a gas reading, they sent someone out without notifying me, I was at work. They have now text three times whilst I'm away! Only a week or so has passed!! Get a grip, don't text on a sunday afternoon and when I call to complain, no sod is available because you supposedly don't operate weekends!Poor!
1304|Our internet was working intermittantly. This was very frustrating. I would try watching 'You Tube' and within seconds the video that I was watching would stop. After contacting Utility Warehouse and reporting the fault this was sorted out and I could again watch 'You Tube' without the video stopping. The person who I spoke to was very clear, respectful and organised. Thank you. Paul.
1305|Excellent customer service
1306|This company is good.I do have difficulty understanding their presentation of your card balance.I am used to accounts showing credits, debits and balances in real time.It may be difficult to do this.
1307|Im happy with Utility Warehouse because they are saving me money on my energy bills. I like the way it is easy to speak to anyone if you  have a query and the staff are understanding and helpful.   I have recently become a Gold customer and am waiting for this to be completed. I am hopeful that I will benefit from using all that Utility Warehouse have to offer.
1308|I recently had the need to speak to the accounts people as I had been notified that my diect debit  amount would be significantly increasing due to my high usage. After explaining the situation with my electric AGA we agreed that my present DD was more than adequate. I have always found the staff very helpful and understanding and I would definitely recommend The Utility Warehouse.to anyone. Why change if you are completely satisfied?
1309|I have been a customer of Utility Warehouse for a number of years. Their prices are very competitive, everything is managed on the internet, and on the very odd occasions that I have phoned them, I have received top quality service. Their call centre appears to be UK based, as their handlers are very efficient and there are no language problems. I would not consider going elsewhere to large impersonal foreign - owned businesses who are too regularly happy to increase their prices and who only appear to operate in the interests of the profits of their shareholders and the greed of their board members at the expense of putting customer care and service first.
1310|We decided to stay with Utilities Warehouse as the bills are printed with clarity and no hidden surprises. The fact that we  are able to make one phone call for both our meter readings monthly with a no nonsense phone all is a bonus. It is a pleasure to actually speak to an advisor if there are any queries and they actually  seem to like their jobs . This is amazing! More and more companies seem to prefer the touch tone system that takes forever to actually be in a position to speak to anyone human.  We have tried various energy companies and can honestly say that Utilities Warehouse was a relief and the best energy swap option for us. 
1311|It's good to find an Energy Company who:1. Do their best to charge fairly;2. Don't falsify Meter Readings like one of the big boys who admitted (when I caught them alleging they'd read the meter on a Sunday) that they substitute their own falsehoods for genuine readings; and3. Have a delightful Customer Service set up which is genuinely designed to be helpful to the Customer.Incidentally, their phone service is just as good!100% from me.
1312|The clearly stated rate for gas and electricity consumption made it easy for me to budget effectively and make comparisons with other suppliers.The customer service staff were friendly and I didn't have to wait long to have my call answered.
1313|They will bill you for services you don't have! I have been billed for BB and telephone, even though they had not ptovided me the same. And when I have tried to dispute it and get my money back, they refused! They took my money through other means even though I cancelled my DD. They refused to cancel my services even though I put it in writing! All in all - DO NOT USE THEM!!!!
1314|Had problem with electricity supply. Very helpful staff member. Problem resolved within 3 hours of reporting it. Thanks for being so briliant with customer service and problem solving.
1315|"I have had nothing but trouble from this company on October the 6th I ordered myself a phone deal from them and still to this day December 23rd I still have no phone and it is always me contacting them to find out the reason why I still haven't received my phone. Sometimes the reasons for me still not having the phone have been valid and understandable but they have also messed up along the way. But the thing that angers me the most is that I'm always chasing them not once have they updated me on the situation and contacted me about problems they are having which could be easily sorted if they rang me. when I ask them why they haven't contacted me they say "" sorry someone should have contacted you"". Well sorry that's not good enough."
1316|excellent service, excellent rates for gas, electric, phone, mobile and broadband, almost impossible to beat
1317|I have been a customer now for two years and have been absolutely delighted with Utility Warehouse. The Customer service is excellent and the cash back card is so valuable. I have recommended them to my family and friends and the ones that have become customers are just as pleased as I am. 
1318|When contacting Utilty Warehouse by telephone or email response is always very quick and helpful. The statements are easy to understand and well laid out,it would take something drastick to change supplier.  
1319|I am generally very happy with the Utility Warehouse.  However, I recently phoned to explain that I had cancelled my direct debit because of changing pay dates with a new job.  I explained that I would be starting the direct debit again as soon as I had my new pay date and would phone to pay any missed payments by direct debit.  All was well, until I discovered that the payment had been taken out of the account anyway.  Why did they nopt tell me that that would happen when I phoned???????
1320|I have only had to contact this company twice and both times the service has been fantastic. Polite staff and efficient service .They allow you control of your account and will always recommend the best option for you but leave you to make the decision. I would recommend them to all. 
1321|Very satisfied. Also staff very helpful. Happy with way utility Warehouse pass on increases. Keep them as low as possible. From our understanding. 
1322|Whilst energy costs are rising, friends are surprised when we tell them what we pay for our package of gas,electricity telephone and broadband.On the rare occasion we have needed to contact uwclub it is refreshing to speak to a real person who has time to address our query in a friendly and efficient manner. When the telephone connection once went down uwclub dealt with it quickly and efficiently maintaining regular contact to ensure the repair was effected both at the time and some days later.Billing is very clear and explanations as to any changes in rates clearly explained. The sums of money other providers use in advertising to generate custom with countless mail shots and unsolicited phone calls at often inconvenient times is not uwclub's way. Such expense is used to keep the cost to their customers as low as possible. New custom is generated by personal recommendation. This speaks for itself! Well done uwclub. Joining you was one of our best decisions.
1323|I have always found Utility Warehouse customer service over the phone to be very polite and top quality. They never aggressively try to sell you additional services. Moreover, their communication with customers through emails about changes to services is very transparent and detailed. 
1324|Easy to understand bill, really good new free customer number &helpful; customer service people.The right tariff ,easpecially when on a very tight budget&I; your circumstances have changed.Cash cash card useful especially at Xmas Competitive prices always 4 electric. Able to keep an eye on expenditures .
1325|At the time of telephone call to your staff, I was satisfied with the help to change Bank details, ( Change form LLoyds to Santander)However, subsequently I find that the DD (NOV) was refused, not surprising since the new account with Santander had only just been set up and monies had not arrived into account.I believe that your staff should have made it very clear to me that the next Bill (NOV) should have been paid by cheque or Phoning with debit card.In fact I discovered myself (02/12) that the November DD had not been made and rang to find out what was the problem. I then Paid by Debit card.I subsequently receieved both Text/Letter, the letter arriving on the 5th Dec.     
1326|I have recently had solar panels installed on my property, and U.W. has been extremely helpful in advising me, and giving me options about the method of providing the information they need.  It was easy to deal with the people I spoke to, and they were patient and explained clearly.The only problem was an incorrect telephone number which was left on my answerphone, which meant I spent some time getting through to the correct department.
1327|Easy to have one bill per month for 4 services, and I especially like being able to phone in at the end of each month and give my gas and electric readings. I feel I have not lost control.The monthly statement is easy to read.When I have needed to phone for information/help, the person at the end of the line has been very helpful and clear.
1328|Great Internet service even I'm only on standard broadband which is free for 6 month no buffering at all compared to EE / orange broadband were on fibre optic paying more than GBP18 excluding the landline rental so expensive yet not a good server of Internet at all 
1329|I have had problems with a company or companies claiming that I am moving to them for gas for the past two months. Utility Warehouse seem to have sorted this out satisfactorily and the staff have been very helpful
1330|Having used Utility Warehouse now for almost 3 years I can honestly say that I am completely happy with their service, they deliver what they promise. Whenever I have needed assistance they have always been easy to contact, polite & professional, and the way I was dealt with leaves me feeling totally satisfied in their ability to provide the excellent standard of service that we should expect from a utility supplier. I like the Cash Back facility and the choice of retailers where all manner of items can be purchased. The simplicity and easy reading of the monthly bill makes things so much clearer. Finally I have every confidence that they will provide me with a most competitive package for all their services and have been happy to recommend them to anyone.
1331|EVERY THING IN A FEW WORDS ARE GREAT ALWAYS THERE TO HELP WHETHER ON HERE OR BY PHONE SORRY CANT SAY MUCH MORESALL PRODUCTS ARE GREAT WISH THEY HADN'T TAKEN OFF FREE CALLS FOR OVER SEAS ALTHOUGH HALF A PENNY I SUPPOSE IS NOT BAD  
1332|I have just transferred my gas, electric, phone and broadband to Utility Warehouse and have already found it to have been simple and easy to do. Not only that I am saving money and the billing system used is also simple and easy to understand. Having one Bill for everything is so much easier and the service I have received so far is almost too good to be true! Any queries, correspondence and questions I have had has all been dealt with quickly and appropriately :)
1333|Utility Warehouse offers a refreshing change from other providers. As well as being competitive on price, their customer service is a world apart and you don't get lost in a maze of bureaucracy and departments like at British Gas etc. When I've had an issue, I've managed to speak to someone straight away who knows my account and resolves it quickly.
1334|Recently had a few problems with Broardband server dropping out regularly,emailed the Utilities Warehouse Technical Team and it was sorted to my satisfaction quickly and courteously.Their technical instructions were very clear and concise,and they phoneed back at the promised time to check the fix was working corretly on TWO occasions,as well as sending me FREE parts needed next morning....the best IT support I have ever dealt with!
1335|"I called the morning after discovering the phone was ""dead"" and within ten minutes the problem was passed to an engineer. By that time I tried it at teatime, everything was back to normal."
1336|Staff very helpful and dealt with my broadband disconnection problem very promptly.  They even called after BT had repaired the fault to check that my problem was solved.UW communicate any changes to rates etc very well.I also like the way the monthly statements have a lot of information on them.I often recommend to friends.
1337|clear bills help always at hand and dealt with
1338|"In order to work out if Utility Warehouse could save you money, you first have to understand how they make there money.I have been a customer with UW for 2 years now and my husband has been a UW Distributor for just over a year. We are a Christian family.As a Christian family we now feel unable to continue our involvement with UW. Please let me explain. They are a very dishonest company, as there utilities are a smoke screen and in order for them to remain in the telecoms & energy market they don't need to be as competitive as they would like ""Prospects"" to believe.They tell there customers & ""Prospects"" that there is ""NO minimum contract"" this is a big fat lie. Because there is a contract termination fee and no one tells you about this when you sign up. Then if you move home they enter you into a ""Minimum term contract"" once you move your services to your new address.There whole business model is built on selling utilities on behalf of the companies that provide Utilities (ie Npower, Talk Talk and a few more)  and in exchange the providers give UW a massive discount for the services that they supply to UW customers. I hear you ask ""How do the Providers make money out of this arrangement?"" It's simple the Providers get big kick backs from UW in the form of stake holder shares.  Now this kind of arrangement happens in the business world everyday and it is NOT illegal at all but here is where it affects the UW customer. The only way as a UW customer you could save money in a big way with UW is to be earning GBP30,000 a year after tax. The reason why this is the case is because they don't need to be the cheapest within the market, they just need you to believe that they are. You might seem a bit confused right now, let me explain.They provide: Telephone/Broadband, Energy & Mobile Services. If you take out all of there services you will save around 5% on you energy cost. Sounds great but the other service that they provide are cheaper from other companies and cancel out any saving you would make by just shopping around for cheaper deals, ie having your services from more than one company. So they can provide you with a Cash Back Card. Wow that sounds even better, you can save upto GBP600 and beyond per year (Unlimited Cash Back)  with your Cash Back Card but you will need  to spend GBP1000 each and every month on your Cash Back Card to save GBP600 a year. Do UW fully understand how much it costs to live these days. There is No problem I will spend GBP1000 a month in Argos each month or on eating out in restaurants but then there is always the option of becoming a very loyal customer to Sainsburys and never buying your food anywhere else.It's is a rich mans club, RMC should be it's re-branding lol. Yet because of how the markets work they need you to believe that a mere normal person like you and I could save money. It's more about legal money laundering. As UW will earn as much Cash Back from the Cash Back partners as UW customers do. Now you can start to see that Utilities are just a means to make money, they don't care about  Utilities. They would sell chocolate frying pans if the money was good. Just like there telecom services, they are just as good as a chocolate Tea Pot.I do hope this helps you make a more informed choice about weather UW is the right company for you."
1339|The service is very good. Your agent is exceptional.The information on the bill is very helpful.Just keep all the prices down.Ikeep telling my friendsto join.
1340|I have phoned them up several times and they have always been very helpful, I fully recomend  Utility Warehouse to anybody.
1341|Short and sweet review - when I have needed help staff have always been very helpful and really taken notice of what you have to say (which isn't always the case).  They seem genuinely keen to resolve any problems you may have.  I would recommend them as a service provider.
1342|for the last 50 odd years british gas has been our supplier and also more recently electricity as well and like a lot of people we believed that this supplier was as good as the rest however after reading about utility warehouse in the which magazine i decided to call them. i must say i was really surprised to learn that 1 they also provided telephone and broadband as well as gas and electricity. 2.there was no contract. from my first call the staff have been excellent. we believe that our move from BG has been a very positive move. thank you.
1343|My problem with my internet connection was quickly resolved.  
1344|We are very pleased with Utility Warehouse. We send in meter readings regularly and receive accurate and concise statements. It is so helpful to have all bills in one statement. If a query shoould arise, we have found the staff helpful, efficient and polite. What else should we need?Carry on the good work!
1345|Always very polite & helpful. Utility Warehouse recently found ways to reduce our monthly bill - very grateful!
1346|An excellent service, very economical and always helpful
1347|Impressed by the first dealings with Utility Warehouse.Helpful staff,swift response to call,and great prices to start with.All we need now is a continuation of the first class service after all we all need a bit of encouraging and cheerful news with the hikes in prices by all the giants in the energy industry.Keep it up Utility warehouse!
1348|I have had an issue for several months when my broadband kept dropping. However I only contacted Utility Warehouse 10 days ago having changed routers etc. Immediate response by sending  replacement equipment and monitoring broadband. This eventually required Open Reach checking house. They identified old wiring INTO the house and changed it. So hopefully this will work. But Utility have kept me informed all along.
1349|I have been a customer of Utility Warehouse for about 15 years & have always been very well satisfied with the service.  I've had immediate help on the few occasions when I've needed it & can't rate the company highly enough. 
1350|rang with problem, no need to have worried problem solvedfirst class service and would recommend the service to anyone
1351|This is an efficient and reliable service that has been able to help an elderly female with her concerns over Internet set-up and use. Any problems with energy supplies have been sorted with good humoour and sensible advice.The Bill still takes some time to unravel but it is always delivered on time. The customer readings are not always adhered to when pho.ned in or a meter reader has called.
1352|At their initial presentation, they guaranteed utility costs that were the best value obtainable. We signed up for everything 2 months ago - phone, broadband, mobile, gas, electricity and cashback card and were promised reimbursement of any termination fees (up to GBP200). A few days after the electricity was transferred we received a letter stating that their tariff was going up. Fair enough, but when I compared this on line, their new tariff was 30% HIGHER than any of their competitors. I rang to query it and was told it was non-negotiable. I therefore cancelled the electricity and gas and moved them to a much cheaper supplier.Last week I received a BT termination invoice of GBP81 and referred this to Utility Warehouse for reimbursement as promised, only to be told that as we didn't now have four or more of their 'services' we didn't qualify for reimbursement. IT WAS ONLY DUE TO THEIR BREACH OF CONTRACT THAT WE CANCELLED TWO OF THEIR SERVICES !!Put it another way - we would need to accept increased and exorbitant tariffs for them to honour the promise they made at their original presentation.They have failed to keep to their promises and I find their business practices very dubious. Before I signed up I read a lot of reviews about them, and 70% were good. I wish I had paid more attention to the other 30%.
1353|The Utility Warehouse have saved us time & money since we've been with them. All our utilities are on one simple monthly bill and all details are clear and understandable. We also found their charges very competitive compared to all their  main competitors , which is the primary reason we switched to them in the first place. We also save money on our bills using their internet shopping cash back and  their cash back card which gives us cashback against our bills  when we shop in our local shopping centre/ high street. There is one negative though and this happened only recently when I tried to call customer services i.e. I was waiting approx. 10 minutes for my call to be answered. However,they did apologise and were very sympathetic, explaining that these problems were being addressed. 
1354|I rang to put on the new calling charges , the lady was so helpful and explained everything clearly .And then went on to ask if I need the new bill cover which I don't as a pensioner so I am now paying less .I am always so pleased I found Utlity warehouse.
1355|I would recommend utility warehouse because what they say they try there best to deliver also you have one bill to check that also makes life easier They have also been most help full in call center advice and information 
1356|I love utility warehouse - they are easy to deal with, the staff are knowledgeable and pleasant.  customer service is great, phone answered quickly.  I've got the full package of phone, gas, elec, broadband and my bills seem very reasonable when compared to others in similar circumstances.  I first changed over to them because they were rated highly by Which and I would recommend them to anyone.
1357|Particularly liked the layout of the UW booklets, and the helpful customer support line...and of course the bottom line - value for money!
1358|BEING ABLE TO SUPPLY  USED GAS & ELECTRIC NUMBERS MONTHLY MEANS I KEEP ON TOP OF MY OUTGOINGS AND WILL NOT END UP OWING ZILLIONS DUE TO UNDERESTIMATION.HAVING ALL ( EXCEPT WATER) MY MONTHLY OUTGOINGS TOGETHER ON ONE BILL MAKES LIFE SO CONVENIENT. CASHBACK CARD IS A HELP ALSO TO US VERY O.A.P'S.
1359|Great value for money and excellent service support.
1360|Very helpfull call centre staff no complaints to report If I could make a suggestion Inform new customers you do send a meterReader out twice a year . The first time one came to mine I rang up after I'd let him in to check he was really who he said he was
1361|I have been with Utility warehouse since 2005 ,in that time I have always been happy with the cost of utility's also the standing chargeThe next increase has put the Electric standing charge From GBP3:50 to GBP5.75  The gas wow from GBP1:40 to  GBP5:48 per month.I am pleased to see that they have stoped using a revenue generator i.e. 0844 number. it was a bit much when ,if you had a problem,not of your making you incurred an 0844 charge.I am also pleased to say that problems  I have experienced have been very rare.
1362|Since joining UW I have had no problems at all settling niggles like poor landline telephone with staff always ready to help. The bills are easy to understand and sending meter readings off each month is easy on the Net. One single payment of my utilities by monthly direct debit is so straightforward.The only 2 complaints I have are with the broadband, which is very poor - probably due to our isolated geographical position - and the mobile phone provider that UW uses here - again our remote location does not help. 
1363|I get electricity/FIT/gas/ broadband/mobile / landline all from UC.Excellent help if anything wrong and really efficient paperwork.Sometimes get problem with connecting to server, not sure whose fault that is. Would be even happier if speed increased but cannot afford to pay extra !
1364|I think The Utility Warehouse is a great company - all my services in one bill Gas/Electricity/Internet/Telephone/Television! No fuss. All itemised. Anytime I have had to call I have been met with friendly, informed staff who are polite and helpful.
1365|Contacted twice this week. eack time had fiftenn to twenty minutes of wait which is unacceptable.
1366|"This company Utility Warehouse makes a lot of promises they just don't keep they get you to sign up advocating cheaper bills when the reality is they are far worse than any of the big 6, all the hidden costs and the grossly over estimated bills before you know it you owe them GBPGBPGBP100's sure the first few months are fine the they hit you with well you are on the wrong tariff but fail to explain the tariffs, they are rude and unhelpful and as for the Broadband it's a joke I waited a month then another month with no contact or update from them I did call them and was told ohhhh well we couldn't get you connected they then blamed the connection problems on my last provider Talk Talk so I ended up having to go with BT. If you want fair and honest reviews go to Trust pilot seems to me the reviews on here are perhaps write by UW employees something UW are prone to do as well as tutoring their reps in the ""Hard Sell"". STAY AWAY"
1367|the time I have been with your company I have always been more than satisfied always pleasant to deal with 
1368|I have always found Utility Warehouse representatives helpful, friendly and courteous. 
1369|I spoke to a member of staff who asked me to run some checks, these proved to be unable to solve the problem. A new smart box was ordered for me which arived today, excellent service.Thank you
1370|With all the ways to save money it is a no brainer to join UtilityWarehouse as soon as possible and experience good old fashioned srevice and prices.
1371|Great service received when I recently called in relation to moving home, the lady was very helpful and made life easy and we all know how stressful moving is.  I would definitely recommend Utility Warehouse.  My next stage is to receive the Utility Warehouse saver card.Thank you
1372|It was pleasure doing business with Utilitywise.Professional, simple and friendly staff..Would definitely recommend to friends and families..
1373|I have been with The Utility Warehouse for some 25 Years because they are the best. Why because if you have a problem they answer the phone pretty quick they speak clear English and will explain everything.I have gradually transferred all most all my services in fact in May next year when I transfer our mobile phones they will have everything. Of course prices go up but all is explained before and if you are stopped by other providers to change before you have got out Utility Warehouse they say sorry have good day.Nobody in this life is perfect but this company tries awfully hard to be so.I told me neighbour about the warehouse because she was having a problem with a provider 4 hours later she tapped on the door to say she had moved everything over. Finally it is 1 invoice at the end of each month which is clear and easy to follow, what more could you ask for.
1374|First class service,everyone i have dealt with have been great and very patient and understanding,explained everything in detail to me so that i understood what to do when had problems with my internet.Dealing with electricty the same service was giving to me,also the phone.
1375|a very good service for me in the business and as well at home for many yearsi can only recommended to everyone. not a single problem or complain at all. 
1376|We change utilities and phone to Utility Warehouse and found them to be efficient, everything happened as promised and on time. Would definately recommend to anyone.
1377|With the same Electric Usage and Gas Usage from Sept 2012 to Sept 2013 my expected bill will rise 28% for Electric & 300% for Gas. My Free Daytime telephone calls will now be chargeable at a new (reduced Rate).So I have cancelled only to discover that they want to charge me a disconnection fee. I've objected and this money is being refunded.Yes I'm inhappy that the advertising shows a 6.9% increase, the reality is a lot lot more
1378|Utility warehouse is the best company i have been with , Saves me money off our bills and staff are all very good at there jobs . i will tell friends about this company and hope they save money off bills like i do .The change over from my old company to Utility warehouse was very good .
1379|I am very happy with the utility warehouse. I save money, have all my utilities on one bill for less than I was paying before and I know I'm in good hands. Customer services have been great when I have had to call them. I'd recommend them to anyone.
1380|DUAL FUEL.......I'M CONFIDENT YOU'LL ALWAYS STRIVE TO GET THE BEST DEAL FOR ME.
1381|Now Being Taken To CourtI was recommended this company by friend and thought why not if I can save money so there rep came round and to see us at our home and went through his sales pitch and gave us a estimate on how much it would cost and how we could save money with the cash back card.Cash Back Card Review.They were claiming that I could save and could being the operative work 10-20% of what I spend on the card this might be true for some people but I bet it is a virtually !!UN-obtainable Amount!!The Cash back Card (cash back against your bills for spending on a pre pay credit card)Returned us on average GBP5-6 on a spend of GBP200.00 which works out at about 3% of what you spend BUT you have to pay GBP1.50 a month for the card so it actually works out at about we got back on a average with 2.5% cash back about GBP4.20 not much of a saving as one of the other supply companys will give you more that that off for just setting up a DIRECT DEBIT. Energy Review.The prices were much more that I was paying on average per month we used to pay GBP90.00  in the summer and GBP120.00  in the summer and GBP120 in the winter combined.Utility Warehouse Pricing Review.We Paid a random amount each month which did not reflect how much we had used. One month it would be GBP70.00 the next it would be GBP200.00 no matter what time of the year it was.Billing ReviewWe never revived a written bill just a email saying a fee for the month and a link to log to a website no actual copy was sent to us ever.The bills which were explained as being simple to understand they most certainly are not they have different fees broken up over 4 pages. You will never revive a reminder if a payment is missed. If you miss a payment the amount will not be added to your next bill. So you Will have no idea that have even missed a payment if you are like me and only check if you are informed of a issue.My Story After missing a payment 3 months later I get a call on my way home from work from a collections department.  I asked why they are contacting me they say I have missed a payment so I say how much and what month was it from they could not tell what month it was from as they did not know.  Now I ask would you give some company that calls you money that cant tell you the details??I am suspicious so did not pay I said find out what month and I will check it they did not call me back so I call utility warehouse the next day to check it was not a scan they confirmed there was a outstanding balance so I asked them to send me details on how I could pay they sent me bank details via email I transferred the amount.Two months later I get a call from the agency again saying I have not paid them I provided them sort code, account no, amount, and date of transfer and asked them to confirm they had the payment again they did not call me back. Then I receive a letter saying they are taking me to court for the amount as they cant find the payment I only found this out as they tried to bill me for GBP600 this month with no missed payment letters, no call backs from the collection agency, No offer of a payment plan.I am still fighting this now save yourself the stress of dealing with this incompetent company and go else ware for your energy.
1382|Switched over electricity from the Utility Warehouse after moving into a flat as we were warned by our boiler installer that the company was rubbish. After paying nearly GBP90 for under a month and a half worth of summer time electricity for a 2 bedroom flat with both occupiers working full time, we have repeatedly been billed again and again for more money. The total now being over GBP500 claimed by the energy company. Clearly, we did not use the electricy being claimed. After rining on numerous occaions, writing several times, being promised call backs, we have now been advised that our 'debt' has been passed over to a debt collection agency...owned by the Utility Warehouse. Upon trying to contact the debt agency to advise that the monies are not owed and that there is an ongoing dispute...we cannot get through to speak with anyone, as both numbers supplied ring through to the same person's voice mail. I would urge people to think long and hard about using the Utility Warehouse as their energy supplier of choice, as my experience of their customer service is pretty much non-existent.
1383|We have just received a huge increase in our budget plan amount for Gas & Electricity based on the fact they didn't take a meter reading for over a year. Basically we used to pay a monthly amount of GBP195 which they have now increased to GBP376!They claim we owe GBP1300 in electicity costs, but we also have a credit balance of GBP713 for our gas usage, so if we owe anything it is just less than GBP600. We have disputed the bill and pointed out the correct outstadning balance. Their response was to re-invocie us for GBP423!Apart from that, I note from our last bill they have increased all the unit prices by 10% and we have not been informed of any unit price rises. How can they justify a rise of 10% across all unit prices and how can they justify not informing their customers? For a Company who are meant to be providing the lowest utility prices this is shocking! We can change supplier to Scottish Power who will charge a day rate of 12.885 pence per kilowatt (they charge 16.817 pence) and a night rate of 5.519 pence (they charge 5.500 pence). For Gas they charge a unit rate of 3.425 pence (they charge 4.403 pence). How can Utility Warehouse justify this?May I suggest you look at your prices and see if you can indeed do as you suggest on your website and get the cheapest deals for your customers? May I also respectfully suggest you get you meter readers to phone ahead and make an appointment to carry out meter readings in future?
1384|"A so called friend got me to sign up with them because he wanted me to do him a ""favor"", I was told that I only had to give one notice to end my homephone / broadband service with them. Basically as soon as I signed up then I had to wait an entire 3 weeks for them to connect me, then after that they still had not sent me out the equipment to actually get connected to the internet, so I had to go out and buy my own. After many discussions on the phone with them about how bad their ""first impression"" has been on my I decided to ""cancel"" my 1 months contract with them and move to Sky. But it turned out that all of a sudden i'm tied to a 12 month contract with them and if I leave then I will have to pay an early termination fee. I contacted the guy (so called friend) that helped sign me up and he said that I did mention that to me (no you did not). Gaz"
1385|"Selfish worthless company that only cares about money. Doesn't understand any circumstance at all, taking any amount from the bank without permission when a set amount had been agreed to. Extremely expensive, their ""special features"" that they offer are worthless and overall I would not recommend them as a company. I have used a fair few companies and this is by far the worst!"
1386|When I call the customer service I know in advance how long I will wait for which usually is in less time than expected and customer service team's professionalism in responding all queries is fantastic. I appreciate a high level quality of customer service.I recommend Utility Warehouse to all.
1387|"I have been a customer of Utility Warehouse for over a year and in that time whenever I have not supplied gas and electricity meter readings they have made wild overestimates of my consumption significantly increasing the price of my bill. Each time this has happened I have had to phone up, suspend my direct debit and wait until the next month for an adjusted bill to be issued. The cost of these calls from a mobile have also been significant.When I eventually moved house and was able to close my Utility Warehouse account, I received a bill with both substantial overestimates and bogus meter readings on the same day as the estimate. These appeared on the bill as ""Meter reader's Meter readings"" and were higher than both the estimates and the readings that I had taken myself on the same day. I can only assume that these had been automatically generated by Utility Warehouse to further increase the cost of the bill for unwitting customers."
1388|following the exiting new announcements made on 09/11/2013 I find it odd that there was no announcement about the newly introduced standing charges which came in at the same time, maybe they just forgot about them ?,reading Wednesdays daily mail 13/11/2013 even they didn't know about them either as they state only 2 utility providers set there standing charges at zero (as all the suppliers can (if they want to)but that now looks like only 1 ebico, so a fresh look is required as to who is best. ho hum here we go again.
1389|I have not been with you long enough to find out if you are as good as seen on the internet.
1390|I am really pleased with these new changes. I am currently a customer of about 9 months and I'd like to state how much I like these new changes. Living in a very rural part of wales and not having gas has meant that I couldn't reap all the benefits with utilitywarehouse but now I can. I can be what they call a gold service and I will get the cashback card now too.  My distributor is very professional and she keeps me informed and sorts everything's out for me too. A very happy customer!
1391|I have been with Utilitywarehouse for over 3 years now for: telephone, broadband, gas and electricity. In that time the broadband service has gone from ok to poor. On close inspection of the modem logs the connection from the ISP is dropped at least 3-4 times every 10mins even more than I thought. I don't mind slowish broadband but this intermittent and very slow / throttled is unacceptable. Technical support altered a few things server side and were friendly enough but could not resolve anything over period of six months. Company seem ok, and I have not been left on hold for long. But it is perhaps suited for customers / distributors who take all services. I had to change to a better broadband service but as a result lost most discounts for the other services so can now save GBP200/year on gas and electricity elsewhere. Eggs in one basket is not for me. The cash card would be totally lost on me too - I simply don't have the time to worry about another account or if there is enough money on the card to make 3-10K plus purchases per month. Maybe something for retirement.    
1392|A couple of years ago I was talking to my ex brother in law about my electricity bill. As a single mum if two pennies were tight and I was paying 140 a month just for my electric . He told me he could help and came to show me what I could save .Straight away my electricity bill was halved and I could save 20 quid on my mobile I was thrilled. Over the last two year I have saved 2000 pounds which has enabled me to provide extra treats for the children which I wouldn't have been able to do like cornet lessons for my daughter. On the rare occasions I've had a problem I spoke to customer services with minimal fuss and they were extremely helpful. They even wrote to me to inform me my exchange had been updated abd they were changing my onto a new line saving me even more money . Best thing an ex in law has ever done :)
1393|I have had electricity from Utility Warehouse for about 10 years and this November they have raised their charges by 25.0% for daytime electricity and 31.6% for nighttime (economy 7, excluding VAT at 5%). This is possibly the highest price rise in the history of electricity suppliers!Their previous high ratings count for nothing!
1394|We have had a massive saving in the first year we joined the Utility Warehouse and large savings every year since, We have recommended members of the family and many friends.If wee need to speak to Head Office for any reason, calls are answered very quickly, dealt with efficiently and staff are courteous and helpful at all times.
1395|My attraction to this service was to get all my utilities billed together at a competitive price. I have Gas, Electric (incl FIT payments)Home phone/Broadband, Mobile,cashback card. They achieve all my requirements. Monthly billing - I supply monthly meter readings, and all online. It may be possible to achieve better prices on some items but as an overall package I would highly recommend. Staff and customer service excellent.
1396|Utility warehouse was recommended to me by a friend, and since joining i can honestly say i have not looked back; the changeover was easy, it was all done for me, and the savings have been vast.Beforehand i was paying GBP68 for just my gas and electrics, but now i pay less than GBP50 for all five services.Recently i had a problem on my phoneline, and U.W. had it fixed within days.My recommendation to all would be to explore joining as an option, for its moneysaving benefits; the sales staff are helpful in their advice, and not at all 'pushy' in handling your enquiries.
1397|Utilities Warehouse Business telephone and broadband services was a nightmare from Day 1. Promises from the distributor weren't kept. Follow up non existent. Business customer services contradicted each other every time we spoke to someone different. The latest saga (there have been several I am not going to bore you with) was moving away from UW when we moved office at the beginning of October. I have rung 8 times since mid September to explain we were moving offices and wanted to port the telephone number but to leave UW and to cancel all services (telephone, broadband). The number was ported mid October but we got a letter saying we hadn't cancelled any services and would have to pay until the mid November. When I rang(again)to find out what was going on, they couldn't explain why we would still want to keep broadband and telephone at our old office when we had moved office to a different part of London and changed provider (which they knew as that's the only way you can port a 'phone number). After that call we got a letter saying that the date we had to pay had been moved to the end of November. After weeks of being polite but getting nowhere, today I lost my temper with the poor person at the other end of the phone, wasn't annoyed with him as a human being but him as a rep of UW. Apparently everything has now been sorted out... am not convinced as I have to wait until the end of November to get an invoice to see what they're invoicing us this time. Why does nothing get done until you resort to shouting? Why could they not have done what they were supposed to do in the first place? Dreadful dreadful dreadful. Avoid their business services. I have no comment on their domestic services as I do not, and unsurprisingly will not, subscribe to any of those services
1398|I was very apprehensive about switching my broadband provider - we have all heard the horror stories! I was very impressed with the quality of the support team. They were very patient and took great trouble to work through the changes with me. I did have a problem (of my making) but it was quickly resolved. I really like that they tell you how long you are likely to wait for someone to talk to, and it was never unreasonably long.I fed back to the company that I had not expected any down time during the switch and I got thanks and a full explanation. They say they will make sure customers are made aware that some downtime is inevitable.This excellent communication has always been my experience of customer service at Utility Warehouse and I have been a customer for over ten years.
1399|I am very satisfied with the service I get from the Utility Warehouse, for electric, gas, telephone and broadband supply.
1400|Needed to replace old router with a wireless one - rang UW one day, ordered, charged to my account and was delivered the next day!  Courteous and helpful service.
1401|We were with Utility Warehouse several years ago and left to get a fixed rate deal. We came back to UW after getting several incorrect bills and awful service.  We now have all fuel and phone with UW and would highly recommend their services. We get an excellent deal on our fuel bills and great customer service! 
1402|I have recently purchased 25 Eaton Court DN34 4UD and compared your prices with my supplier at my present home and they appear to be much cheaper,until we move on Nov. 28 I am unable to give any other feedback.                              John Hemingway.                       
1403|I pay all my Gas Phone Electricity through Utility Warehouse. It convenient The staff are always helpful polite and professional.They always get high ratings in Which Magazine for Customer Service an and Broadband .
1404|I've reduced the costs for my energy, mobile & landline as promised by the distributor who registered me. Its all on one bill so its easy to budget and I'm also looking forward to an extra 10% back on my spend on my energy in the 1st year with them.It does what it says on the tin. Save money and no problems and only one UK telephone number to call if I need to speak to someone. Fortunately I haven't needed to.I was very sceptical but I already knew friends and family who were using the services so it made sense to at least try it out and now I'm so glad I did.
1405|EVERY TIME I CALL ANY HELPLINE I ALWAYS GET AWESOME SERVICE, THAT SAYS IT ALL = ]]
1406|call centre staff member was excellent very helpful, friendly and able to set ,y account up speedily. I had been very wary as the written communication I found to be very stern, unfriendly and quite intimidating!
1407|I am an electricity customer of Utility Warehouse. My property is not connected to the main gas pipeline. I switched to this company due to poor service form my previous provider, and because the charges seemed to be competitive. I have not checked prices recently. I have become very satisfied with the standard of service. I am happy to recommend the company for this reason. Whenever I have a problem, I contact the company by email. I receive an acknowledgement and then a personal response soon afterwards. Responses have been by email and telephone.
1408|I use Utility Warehouse, not only for electricity, but Gas, Broadband, Home phone(Land line) and two mobile's.The prices are very good the customer service is excellent I certainly would not use any one else
1409|I have been a customer of Utility Warehouse since long before it was called that--quite a few years ago. The service I have received has been outstanding in all respects, including overall costs and unless something goes badly wrong, which seems unlikely, I would not dream of changing to another supplier of any of the services I receive. Getting it all on one bill also is such a help. The few queries I have had have been dealt with quickly and effectively.Downsides ? Can't think of any.Peter Carrington
1410|A good deal to be had as a gold member. The mobile phone tariffs are unbeatable. They are very approachable and your contact is always there to help anytime. 
1411|UW, in my experience, has been efficient, effective and price conscious. When I have had a problem it has been dealt with in a speedy and polite manner, clear explanations and generally very helpful and reassuring.
1412|Closed the account and paid in full, received a letter confirming this. 6 months later get a threatening call telling me I owe 100 pounds. An hour later the guy admits they've made a mistake and in fact owe me 94 pounds with the 6 being written off as good will. A month later I receive a letter from a debt collection agency owned by utility warehouse asking for 6 pounds. The bills are confusing, the tariff overpriced, the customer service appalling. I'm putting a complaint in to ofgem. I've spoken to them on the phone over 10 times and each time they say the account is closed only for a bill to follow. I've just received an email telling me my tariff has changed on a property I notified them I had moved out of 6 months ago.  Avoid like the plague.
1413|It's so easy: - to pay only once, from one direct debit, for all utility bills every month. And there's no agonising over which company gives the best deal: In three years my bills have been consistent and amazingly low when I compare them with those of friends.If a query arises, there is always someone (in the UK) friendly, and who speaks good, clear English, patiently, and with understanding of an old fogie like me. If I have a problem with payment, they always have a reasonable solution;  and they are unfailingly polite. If there's a queue on the phone line they will tell you how long it is, and how you are progressing; although mostly they deal with your call within a couple of minutes.And the bills are actually devised in such a way they are easy to understand - phone bills analysed, gas and electricity consumption explained.No, I've not been put up to this; I just welcome the opportunity to show my appreciation for such excellent service over the years. Do give them a whirl, at least to explain their philosophy far better than I can. THANK YOU, UTILITY WAREHOUSE!!
1414|Great company. Always have sorted and resolved my questions in a very friendly manner over the years I have been with them.I have been a member of The Utility Warehouse for many years and I still have in good working condition a Nokia mobile phone with its original battery which I pay a nominal rent for since around the early nineties, Amazing!!!Maybe Utility Warehouse might like to put it in their museum if they have one and present me with a new phone free of charge and rent.( If you don't ask you don't get. )It is now a few years since I went for the complete package which has  elevated me to gold star status and have to say it is probably one of the best decisions I have made in quite awhile.
1415|There are good and bad in all companies, and the prices fluctuate all the time and one minute you could be with the cheapest provider than the next be one of the dearest.When switching always find out what your final bill is too, because a lot of people who do switch are because they need all the money they have. Then they find them selves with the dreaded final bill, so always check before agreeing to sign up with your new supplier. Also door to door sales people have crafted there spiel so good that most people would trust what they are being told, after all they want there commissions so before you sign up to anything find out if what they are saying is legit. Having your energy and your phone and broadband all on one bill can be better for some people and in a lot of cases can save you money too. The amount of things I read on the internet is ridiculous, do not believe everything you read. I read something on a forum the other day about the Utility Warehouse, here is what I had read,  http://goo.gl/G14dzv I think they are a good company but there is always room for improvements.
1416|Lowri Beck engineer left us in the lurch with weak power, in fact hardly any power, and the property was in danger because he left the earthunconnected. Electricians were called, which means a bill is forthcoming, which I am not willing to pay.The fault was traced but only SCOTTISH POWERwas allowed to rectify it. It wa disgusting that this should have happened.I would like you to inform Lowri Beck of their poor service on this occasion, and tell them to pay the electrician's bill when I send it to them.Please send me their address. Thank you. I might add that UW cLUBsuits me  and I am satisfied, but not satisfied with Lowri Beck.
1417|I have, and will continue to recommend UW Club to others.
1418|Not only reasonable charges, but only one piece of paper!
1419|your sevice team do what it says give a great service you cannot get a better overall deal with there competitors
1420|Utility warehouse staff give excellent polite service whenever I call them with a query or problem.  My Utilities are all paid on one monthly bill making things simple and easy.  I have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone
1421|I was  asked to talk about this company by my NEICE,and was sure there was no way I would change my utitity providers.. But after listening to her, and the way she explained the  savings on my then present provider, I decided to make the change.Everything was told to me so I could understand it,as I don't like change, and told there would be someone there if I needed to be help... I am so,glad at the moment that I changed. Now talking to my son and daughter to show them the savings you can get with this company.Thank you 
1422|The statement I receive monthly is clearly presented and easily understood,something I didn't have with my previous supplier.Coupled with this is the access to friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff on the end of a telephone to sort out any queries should they arise.At the right price what more could you ask from an energy provider.   
1423|I have just upgraded to a new TP-link N router and found that I could not access the internet because I no longer had my original letter with my password and access code.Having reconnected the old router I emailed customer services who later phoned me on my mobile and after some security questions gave me the information I needed. Connection was established.I have to say I was very pleased with the service I received.
1424|I had the unfortunate pleasure of inheriting this company from a previous tenent.  The first letter i got was a threat to install meters and get a warrant to install a meter and charge over GBP700 for the privelage.  I mmediately informed them i was not a customer and moved providers.  They then sent an erroneous bill for the electric .  Even though i gave them the correct reading as witnessed by the letting agency.  The letting agency contacted them to no avail i have contacted themn and recieved no reply so far.  I found the tone of their letters to be aggressive, vauge, confusing and misleading.  I found their advisors to be incompetent and abrupt.  There is no 0800 number and they charge you for the pleasure of ringing them to sort out a problem they created.
1425|Just added my mobile, all services now on one bill - fab!!!
1426|Utility warehouse is a very helpful company and always gives good personal service and responses to questions. In the majority of instances that I have had cause to contact them the staff have always gone the extra mile to help.Overall my bills are considerably cheaper than any other provider I have ever had and it is very useful to have it 'all under one roof'.Cash back card is great !
1427|I've been a long standing customer, I have most services my engery , phone and broadband oh and the cash back card now too. I'll be honest I like having control and all of it on one bill, everyone moans out green this and that but this company have been doing it for years ... Being green I mean. Excellent people at the end of the phone when needed. Never any problems I confidently say Ill never change.. Few months back I saved GBP40 off my bill with my cashback card - it's brilliant! I shop and it's paying my bills. I recommended it to my friends all the time.
1428|Utility Warehouse must have the nicest and most helpful telephone personal I have ever come across.  They are a delight to deal with.
1429|Just to say I am satisfied with the service I am getting
1430|Awesome, helpful, efficient, always welcoming. Moved houses and all account was moved with me no problem. One bill-less trees killed, and less paper mess in the house. Cashbackcard, what a savings!!! Happy Happy Happy!!!!
1431|I have been with a few different suppliers and I find Utility Warehouse to be amongst the best.  I don't think you can go wrong with them.
1432|I like the control I feel I have, inputting my own meter readings and able to check myself where the money goes!I love the clarity of a monthly account where I can see exactly what my costs are.I adore the fact that this is a comprehensive service, covering my gas, electric, telephone and broadband.
1433|I think that on the whole prices are very reasonable in this day and age
1434|Staff were happy to listen to my problem and suggest a solution.  Problem resolved with minimun of fuss.I always find staff helpful when I have phoned utility warehouse.
1435|They help you and very good in surport
1436|"My daughter was complaining about the cost of utilities for her family home, so I recommended that she change her provider to Utility Warehouse, I have been with them for many years, and am completely satisfied with every aspect of the dealings (You always let yourself in for something) so she asked me to look at the bill she had received from her supplier, and work out what the savings would be should she change provider. To do this you need the cost per Kilowatt-hour X Kilowatt- hours used; the Utility Warehouse bill makes this information completely clear! the bill from the other supplier certainly didn't.Apparently the government is trying to pressure all suppliers to use this transparent approach; ""but should it come to that""? For value for money, and a straightforward approach to business, I recommend Utility Warehouse."
1437|Working well and able to correct if there is a problem
1438|Always gives an answer to an question asked. and reply promptly.
1439|The Utility Warehouse is a  trustworthy, reliable, easy to use service. Customer service is outstanding.I like the feeling of being able to monitor and control my bills and spending ,with the monthly on line bills and meter readings.There is excellent on line and telephone technical Broadband support.I like having all my utility services under one provider.Only thing I don't like about broadband service is the plastic Router which is not substantially made and I've needed 2 replacements and latest one  often turns itself off annoyingly. It was expensive to return faulty routers by recorded post.How ever,I am more than happy with Utility Warehouse as my energy provider. 
1440|Excellent service and knowledge in providing me with the right information. Gas electric from a company cheaper than the big 6 and a budget plan like nothing else 
1441|I cant believe how little I am now paying for my gas and electric, didn't have any fuss about changing over and when I rang to find out if I was doing it right they went through all my questions without a hint of annoyance. I'm not a problem caller they said when I apologized for being a pain, I'm a valued customer with a concern. WOW did I feel special.
1442|I saved GBP100 per month on my utilities.I also find it easier to pay for five bills in one, it enables me to budget better.It is easy to speak to a human being, and get a sensible, uncomplicated answer.My only problem is that I forget to give a dual fuel reading at the end of the month.Iwould definitely recommend U.W.to friends and family.
1443|I have been a customer of the Utility Warehouse for Gas, Electricity, telephone and broadband for a number of years.  I have found the prices comparable, and at the start of my contract with them, kept a comparison on usage and prices paid from the previous year.  Starting with the Gas and quickly changed all other utilities because of the saving.  When I have needed to contact the Customer Service department, I have been contacted within 2-3 minutes, which is unusual in this day and age, and have been treated with courtesy and any query resolved quickly.  Cannot speak highly enough of the service and cost provided by Utility Warehouse.
1444|I had a query about a refund to my U/W cashback card.  I got straight through to an adviser and I had my query answered in a matter of minutes.  Overall I am very happy with all aspects of Utility Warehouse & would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money (look at 'find me the cheapest', it's great). All our family are now members :)
1445|We have used utility warehouse for gas electricity phone & broadband for many years & would not consider changing other companies cant complete.service is very good.
1446|I have never had any dealings with such brilliant staff.Every department I have dealt with have been so helpful, and patient waiting while I try to explain what my problem has been, broadband, telephone, mobileand even my electric meter. over the years I have been with t. u. w.I have been sorely tempted to phone them just for a chat but I know that would be very remiss of me to do such a thing!The best thing I ever did was sign up with t.u.w. I really know I am in safe hands with them. It is a great feeling, as I know there are a lot of unscrupulous company's out there. Also the fact that they are stationed in the u.k. and I am not speaking to people the other side of the world, who I can't hear or understand!!!
1447|We have been with Utility Warehouse for a few years now and have been very satisfied with the service we have received. The bills are very clear and very easy to understand. Although I check prices each year on comparable sites, we have not been tempted to change suppliers. I had reason to speak to the office recently with a query. and the person I spoke to was very helpful. I would recommend this supplier to everyone.
1448|I was having a problem with my phone & the lady was most helpful, we went through lots of things , & managed to fix the fault which was good. Good helpful service, nothing was too much trouble, keep up the good work.
1449|I have been with Utility Warehouse for the past 3 and a half years having switched after having problems with my previous supplier over meter readings and billing, etc., I spent many hours trying to sort out the complicated bills and the costing. Since being with Utility Warehouse I take monthly gas and electric readings and know exactly how much i've used and the cost. The bills are uncomplicated and straightforward.I also have my gas and phone line with Utility Warehouse and i am now in the process of having broadband provided by them. On the few occasions i have had to contact Utility Warehouse I have spoken to a HUMAN BEING!within minutes of calling, which seems to be very rare in this automated world where one tends to spend a time pressing numbers on the phone or listening to music for long periods of time before actually speaking to anyone! Whenever i've spoken to customer service at Utility Warehouse they have always been polite and very helpful.I would definitely recommend this company on my experience over the past few years with them.
1450|It is very pleasing to actually understand and talk to someone who knows the English language  and can answer you so you can understand what you are being told in straight forward answers and questions very satisfied so far.. 
1451|I have been a customer of  utility warehouse for 5 years and find them the best company I have dealt with so far.I have all my services off then gas. Electric. Phone and broadband .I also have two mobile  SIM cards with them  one myself also one for my better half and also find that the cheapest option.If you do have problem as I have a few weeks ago with my land line,you speak to an operator in the UK and not abroad,it makes a differanse when you can under stand the person that you are in conversation with,the phone problem that I had Was a line fault belonging to BT,which when reported to utility warehouse was promptly dealt with.I have been on comparison web sites to find a cheaper supplier and only could find one that was cheaper,it would  haveSaved me GBP14 not worth the bother of changing,that was for only gas  and the electricity , and not phone and broadband .I am very happy to stay with utility warehouse for the foreseeable future .
1452|We were recommended to the Utility Warehouse by a friend as, like the majority, we had not heard of you.  We like the straight forward one rate of unit. In 2010 we added, as new to the internet, the broadband part of the service. The cost of this as minor users, especially embracing the line rental, has proved to be a great help to my wife and I as pensioners.
1453|Never had any major problems. Any minor ones have been sorted very quickly. Lovely lots of free telephone calls and very cheap ones when I ring family in New Zealand.My friends all know how   I feel but I don't push them to change. I'sure they will when they are ready.
1454|"I joined UW some 3 years ago and have not regretted it for a single moment.Their Customer Service is absolutely Fantastic. The ""Big Six"" could learn a lot from them.I personally took their 4 Star Gold Package which include Gas, Electricity, Phone/Broadband and Membership, which provides you with everything.The icing on the cake is their Cashback Card, which when used sensibly in companies affialiated to them, entitles one to Discounts on purchases. They have a comprehensive A to Z list of these companies. Any Cashback accumulated (either by using The UW Cashback Card or any Credit Card for that matter), quickly mounts up, and is deducted fromm your Monthly Bill, and it can be very useful when purchasing expensive items (Luxury Products).Their Phone and Broadband charges are very reasonable indeed. Gas and Electricity Tariffs are OK but they are generally in line with all the other suppliers, so dont expect miracles. It is the Cashback Card, and Phone/Broadband, Membership, which makes the deal worthwhile.All in all if you considering ""Switching"" then it could well be worth your while"
1455|Had a phone problem which was resolved very promptly. Agent was very polite friendly and helpful.
1456|my review title sums up my opinion of this firm - long may it last!
1457|The best service ever. If you want to ring up to speak to somebody your not on hold for a long time, you get the best service. Cheapest rates going. Always in a lot of credit with my bills and never had an issue with them. They don't pester you like other companies. Def the best out there.
1458|Utility Warehouse is the best Utility Provider you can have.  They try to remain as competitive as possible, and often beat the others. They keep in touch with you on a regular basis, their bills are easy to read and they maintain professionalism throughout.
1459|Always an excelent service. On the very rare occaisions  that I've had a problem it'always sorted out with the minumum of fuss
1460|Very impressed with the custome service and they are based in the UK!  Very friendly, professional and very helpful.  I have already got my Broadband having registered at the beginning of this month (October) and now waiting for my Gas and Electricity which should happen mid November and I have not had to make one phone call to my existng providers.  I would highly recommend Utility Warehouse as you are saving all the time when you use the cashback card also as it gets deducted of your bill each month. I look forward to making more savings in the future.  
1461|A family member told us about the service they were getting from Utility Warehouse and how they were making significant savings on their energy bills. This coincided with a report in 'Which' magazine which gave them a high rating as energy suppliers. We were visited by the local representative at our request and were impressed by the clear and detailed way in which our questions were answered. There was no sales pressure during the contact. Afterwards we signed up for the full range of their services which included gas, electricity, broadband, and telephone both land-line and mobile.Any queries or technical questions which have arisen have been dealt with promptly,and courteously.  
1462|One of my better moves!........UW are now my supplier for phone, broadband, mobile, gas & electric.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
1463|I had been underpaying during 2013. So I asked to pay off the difference .I was told I could give my meter readings again and change the payment.I did so this week and was told I could reduce my monthly debit by about GBP40! It was sorted there and then for next months payment.
1464|Easy & straightforward website which explains all Utility Warehouse services very clearly. No problem signing up for my sim only package, added benefit of having my Utility Warehouse Distributor to help me if I required.Delivery of my mobile phone sim card was very prompt with easy telephone activation. Customer Service delegate very professional & friendly, I made one call to upgrade my sim package, no fuss or bother.Highly recommended, I will consider using other services provided by Utility Warehouse in the future. 
1465|Which ever Utility You would like to save MONEY on,It's time you visited UTILITY WAREHOUSE FOR A QUOTE !!!!
1466|When I had a problem with another fuel company and wanted to switch an account, the folks at Utility Warehouse were extremely helpful.  They solved my problem in a matter of minutes in a friendly, efficient manner - and I was left wondering how they make it all seem so easy to look after their customers properly!  Well done!  Thank you!  Keep up the good work!
1467|I have just joined the system and everything is looking good so far.My expectations are high in view of the details that I have joined and ampassing the good news on to my friends and colleagues. When the detailsappear so good, it is natural that one is a little unsure as to the outcomeuntil it has actually happened.  So far, there is nothing that I do not likeand a good deal that is very encouraging.
1468|A friend of mine persuaded me to join as she heard I was experiencingmajor problems with British Gas , have been with Utility Warehouse a coupleof years now and can honestly say am very happy with them. Any time I have to phone, my call is handled in a professional manner.The only thing , it would be nice if they could be contacted in the eveningbut not a problem plus I think someone should be around the weekend just in case.  Other than that keep up the good work. 
1469|Good service with my recent order for ultrabroadband and am saving a lot of money on my bills. Only problem I've had is waiting to be answered on the phone.
1470|U.W.Provide my broadband, telephone,electricity & gas.I consider them a first class supplier of these services.Their recent help with my broadbandproblem could not be bettered.
1471|Advisor was extremely helpful. Applied mobile phone block within 24 hours and suggested blocking other numbers which could cause a hefty unexpected bill.
1472|So far very pleased with The Utility Warehouse - competitive prices and bills which are simple to understand.  If you need help their telephone service is friendly, helpful and, although you may be asked to hold, the systems tells you how long you will have to wait.  I have never had to wait more than a minute or two, with my previous suppliers it was not unusual for it to be up to 20 minutes. I have recently had a fault on my phone line.  It was dealt with in much less than 24 hours and I had phone calls to let me know what was happening and then one to check that it had been done.Fantastic!
1473|Suddenly the landline wasn't working, the wi-fi was ok and with mobiles we could still talk, but what was up? We called UW and the friendly guy asked a few questions then excused himself to find out what was wrong, explaining that if it was an external fault, we paid nothing, but if it was internal there could be a charge. It was fine, the little men were once more opening the black telephone box at the bottom of the hill, looking at wires and scratching their heads. Back the UW man came and explained that some local lines were being upgraded, ours would be done in a susequent session and, as often happens, when the men upgrade one part of the system, sometimes other lines suffer, albeit temporarily. Within 20 minutes of the initial call, we were back with a  functioning landline and had not even had to leave the house to learn of the spaghetti junction at the bottom of the hill. The next day we received another UW call, just to check the line was still working and to assure us that we had not incurred any charges. Now that's what I call helpful, efficient and cost-effective. Thank you UW.
1474|We have been with this company for some years and have always been delighted with their service.  They handle our gas, electricity, telephone and internet.  The cost of the service on each and every one of these provisions is very competitive and their customer care is excellent.  So far I cannot fault them!!
1475|Good prices, love the itemised bills all together in one handy statement. Great support - no hanging about for ages on the phone.  Staff polite and helpful. Does what it says on the tin! :Dcan't find anything not to like.  
1476|We have been with Utility Warehouse for ever. I had other companies coming around to try and change me to there own company. Some even said that I would stick with Utility Warehouse as we can't beat there prices. Only the best will do great service. 
1477|We have been using utility warehouse for nearly four years. We were moving from the property, called the company with the meter reading a month before the move date and were told we owed GBP494 in gas and electricity up to the point of the meter reading and our direct debit was cancelled. A month later we moved out, we gave the final meter reading and asked what we actually owed and were told we were in credit and did not owe any money. We needed to confirm this was 100 per cent correct so we called customer services 5 times and all repeated the same information.Another month later we received a letter to say we owe GBP242. Spoke to numerous customer service representatives and they said even though it's calculated using the meter reading, we still need to pay 2 months of payment plans on top of the GBP492 we already paid, therefore we have to pay much more than our actual usage due to this payment plan. Customer service will not budge so will be escalating this to the ombudsman. So save yourself from any future stress and avoid using utility warehouse, they're rubbish!
1478|Having sold my house at short notice Utility Warehouse were able to arrange to switch all of my existing facilities and add a new service to my membership. This was done with great ease, great communication and as always with me the customer at the forefront of there mind!
1479|WE LIKE BEING ABLE TO PUT A SPECIFIC AN MOUNT OF MONEY IF YOU MISSPLACE THE CARD THER IS NO THE ONLY MONEY YOU CAN LOSE IS THE AMOUNT LEFT ON THE CARD, iUSED TO HAVE TROUBLE TRYING TO ENTER MY ELECTRIC READING WITH BRITISH GAS BUT WITH U.W. IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT 30 SECONDS.I LIKE BEING ABLE TO FIND WHERE I CAN GET THE ITEMS I WANT AT THE CHEAPEST PRICE AND WHERE TO BUY THEM AND BEING ABLE THROUGH U.W. TO BET MONEY BACK OFFERS.IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THEY ARE THERE TO HELP I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY LAPTOP AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN A CONTACT NUMBER TO SEE IF TEY CAN SOLVE IT FOR ME.   
1480|I really liked that can each month to pay for gas and electricity,thank you!like money saver!I love everything.thanks!
1481| Thanks for all you have done for me . I feel confident that in Utility Warehouse I am with a company I can trust.I am telling my friends about you.Why do I not see advertisements?
1482|Since I joined I have received only good service at a very competitive price. So competitive that when providers cold call to get you to switch to them you only need to tell them you are with Utility Warehouse and they ring off. Says it all, really!
1483|The service has always been amazing along with the customer service team who are always friendly and efficient. The cost of my Gas and Electricity compared to most suppliers is wonderfully competitive.I would recommend a friend in a flash to use The Utility Warehouse. I have never once questioned using Utility Warehouse and I am completely happy with the service I receive.
1484| I have been a customer of Utility Warehouse for many years and have always found their gas & electricity rates to be very competitive.Their customer service is brilliant and they offer other cost saving benefits.Highly recomended. 
1485|Started well, but went down hill, called home movers 1 month before moving, my new address was recorded wrong. Moved in on 16th September, did not get broadband and telephone connected until 10 th October. I was told I could retain my original land line number. I am on a different number,customers services have given me 3 different excuses, and promised to sort it. I spoke to them on 14th October and they said they would contact me within 48 hours. I am still waiting. The house I moved into as prepayment meters for gas and electricity. I informed the house moving team I did not want these, and i am still waiting for meters to be changed. The house supplier for gas and elec. was eon, but now i have pre payment card and key for uw. I seem to be spending more to top up. I would like uw to get me my original phone number back, and get new non pre payment meters fitted ASAP. With energy prices due to rise, I may be shopping around for a better deal/service.
1486|I have been with Utility Warehouse for about two and a half years and would mot consider changing to another supplier now.  It is so easy to read the gas and electric meters once a month so ones actual usage is costed and monitored on every monthly bill.  Also to have a single monthly bill covering gas, electricity and telephone is a great asset.As far as I can judge their prices are very competitive too.
1487|Although I have only recently joined the U/W I am more than happy so far, and the bills are clearly set out.
1488|Very quick pick up time and good dialogue (a real human) this is most important in this day and age 
1489|I feel that the charges for broadband is too high. In particular against other internet providers
1490|I didn't want to change services as I thought it would be too hard to handle and too much work. This was not the case as it was all done for me with a Member's support.Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient They always responded promptly and got back to you.Was nervous about changing my broadband as I thought I might be without it for a period. Not the case, it was an instant transfer and I didn't know it had happened!.Will recommend Utility Warehouse to all I meet.
1491|I like getting cashback everyday on shopping, save money everyday, excellent customer service and best of all no contract.  One single monthly bill is much better and easier to manage.
1492|We have had to ask questions recently mostly regarding technical issues which were answered very patiently and efficiently.Great as usual!
1493|My experience with Uw costumer services is fantastic very helpful and polite.utilty warehouse is the best piggin utility company with a unique price promise every thing on one bill and a great cash back card where you can even be paid for being a customer. 
1494|After signing up to Utilly Warehouse for Gas, Electricity, Telephone and Internet, I have never looked back. The service is first class. Contact has been easy, helpful,polite and understandable. I am constantly reading what good value it is in all the WHICH reports, which is very comforting. The great thing is that the company seems to be working for it's customers by getting the best deals at good prices. The cash back card works well and it is always nice to see an actual discount on top of good value.I am always reccomending it to friends. It would be good to have some info for friends to give to them.
1495|I started as a customer of U.W. with my first mobile phone in the 90's.   Since then I have added on a gradual basis, my home phone, electricity, broadband and last but not least my debit card.   I do not have gas or I would add that as well.   I can look back over nearly 20 years and honestly say that I have never had a complaint with this company.   There have been a few occasions when I have phoned them for help or advice, and I cannot fault their professionalism.If there is anything that I don't like about the compoany it is the way they set out their statements.   I think they are rather confusing, and would like one page per item, on single sheets.  But, that is just a minor niggle.On the whole Utility Warehouse, staff and prices, is to be highly recommended, and I look forward to them covering water and oil!!!
1496|Staff always very helpful regarding my 3 monthly call to check my tariff  which I find a unique service to ensure I am not over or under paying . I have already recommended you to. family who have recently moved and taken a number of your products. The only negative is that unfortunately that when I moved over to you as my main supplier   I was unable to get the telephone and broadband service as I did not have a BT connection as we were historically with Eurobell/ Virgin
1497|Utility Warehouse is - in my opinion the best.  I am very confident when I go into my account to input my gas and electric readings.  I never get stressed as the site is extremely easy to  move around when I  give my details.  On contacting your service by phone with a query I had the customer service was superb.  I believe your the best service for me and I thank you for making everything easy. I am always recommending you and when Which did their survey I completed same with your many many good factors.
1498|"These were recommended by a friend of many years -I trusted my friend so I gave it a go because I was making a saving, despite never having heard of Utility Warehouse.   Biy, am I glad I did! Not only am I saving money because I was quoted lower, but I'm having money knocked off my bills just for doing my shopping as normal.  I had a ""problem"", if you can call it that, where my mobile could not connect to my Wifi.  I called customer services,  who answered the call in minutes and worked their magic straight away.  Cannot recommend them enough!"
1499|Over many years I have used most of the suppliers of gas and electricity.I have always worried about how big my next bill will be.I am now looking forward to receiving my bill from UW every month as Ican be sure of being pleasantly surprised.
1500|I have been with UW for a couple of years now and have found the savings are great. only once had a problem with my broadband at it was sorted over the phone with just one call. I have introduced family and friends along the way
1501|Always had helpful informative advice.  Phone calls answered promptly - told how long wait will be (unique service!)Flexible approach to dealing with queries/problems.  Great value for money!
1502|I rang to report the problem on Friday and it was dealt with the following day.  I also had a phone call a couple of days later to ask if everything had been sorted out.
1503|I joined the UWClub about 3 years ago, partly to save money and because I could also have broadband/telephone etc on the one bill along with the gas and electricity.I have been generally satisfield with my dealings with this company and appreciate them reducing the price of gas/electricity almost immediately after the drop in prices have been announced.  It is also very useful to have free telephone calls.Occasionally there have been a few hiccups with the4 broadband, but UWClub have always been swift in dealing with those and very helpful.I  do not get the FULL benefit of being a member as I do not have my mobile with the UWClub, neither do I have  a prepayment card, both of which must be a godsend for families.
1504|U.w. Is a low costing utility provider giving house holds a chance of stayibg warm this winter without worrying themselves sick about the electric bill. Very reasonable prices. Plenty of support when you need it. Its great talking to family and friends too not worrying about the cost of your call. Myself and my family are extremly happy with the services, customer service and cost of our monthly bills. They are yet to be beaten in my book. 
1505|Utility Warehouse quite simply offer excellent value for money and completely understand the importance of excellent customer service.  whenever I call in they solve my problems within agreed timescales.  Escellent.  I was so impressed I became a distributor.  whenever you phone people up they have great knowledge about how to resolve issues and they genuinely seem like they care about getting questions answered/problems solved.  I really would, and do, recommend Utility Warehouse to any friends, family and colleagues.
1506|Short but helpful discussion as nothing happening until the big 6 finalise rates.
1507|"Numerous other companies have said that they can beat any quote. Then I say ""U W CLUB"", and they give up straight away. I have recently recommended UWC to a friend and will carry on doing so. The only problem is that people just don`t believe me. All the call-centre staff are very knowledgeable and helpful."
1508|Although Broadband is not the cheapest the land line rates'including free calls to many countries are free. Gas and Electricity prices have always been amongst the lowest. Telephone support for Broadband issues is excellent. Bills are easy to understand. PAYG for basic mobile is only GBP5.00 per month and when I had a difficulty with mobile I had free personal help.My only grouse is the cost of telephone support as it is an 0845 no. which I understand does not apply to anyone joining now.
1509|The monthly account details are very useful and you are able to track and be aware of your costs at all times. The end of month meter readings which you can send via phone and email and online keep you right up to date with you usage and comparison to the previous years costs. Budgeting costs are in general accurate and you do  not get surprised with enormous expensive  bills. The more products which you take from UW enable you to decrease your overall costs and it is useful to keep yourself up to date with new products as and when they are available.Very pleased with the services we receive.
1510|Been with this company since January now and we pay less and less each month now we're getting used to the excellent cashback card as well as online our October Bill was amazingly -GBP13.05 so they payed us where else would you get that? First month Bill was higher as it was 6 weeks worth but distributor had advised of this... Give it a go with no minimum contracts
1511|I am a very new customer so far I like what I get
1512|I saved money by switching, online billing is easy to understand and access.  I am always informed of any offers that are available to me.  The tariffs are easy to understand and I can work out myself how much I am paying.  When I have contacted them they have been quick, courteous and always answered my questions.
1513|I feel I can really talk to the staff members and explain my problems to them without being judged or feeling stupid.  They always put me at ease and are the most friendliest customer team I have ever come across. My only issue is the opening hours.  If I have to ring I can only do so from work, I like to discuss my affairs from the privacy of my home. 
1514|We joined the Utility Warehouse about a year ago and we honestly haven't looked back. We found the gas and the electric tarrifs to be very competitive, the telephone and broadband also worked out to be cheaper than the tarrif we were on, however the tarrif only covers the basic line rental, each 'extra' adds to the cost, i.e the answerphone facility adds an extra cost to the tarrif. The club card works a treat, it really helps me to budget our monthly expenditure, plus of course, any money spent in the particiapating stores does give money off the monthly bill. This is very convenient for us, our local supermarket is Sainsbury's so I can do our weekly shop, earn money off our monthly utility bill plus gain nectar points too.Another plus is the call centres are all UK based. On occasions we have needed to talk to an advisor we have always found them to be extremely helpful and easy to talk with. We have never been rushed through a call. However Longer opening hours would be more convenient.
1515|I enjoy calling utility warehouse because they ask how are you and make you feel comfortable and never leave you on hold and get the issues sorted very quick I know that a new customer would get exactly the same service there is nothing I did not like! I actually liked it
1516|I have been so delighted with the way UWC has saved me money on all fronts, and even been able to reduce the monthly amount required for my electricity supply.Although electricity is going up I know UWC will be doing their best to get me a good deal.
1517|What a relief to be able to speak to someone in a UK based customer service centre who knew what they were talking about and who actually cared about us as customers. We take all our services from The Utility Warehouse - landline, gas, electricity, broadband and mobile phone and we reckon that we have saved about GBP700 per annum compared to our previous suppliers.We also have their Cashback card which gives us additional savings whenever we shop at Sainsbury's (including discounts on petrol and diesel), Marks and Spencers, Argos, Boots and B&Q; - as well as loads of other stores.We also like the fact that we get only one monthly bill and only one direct debit per month from our bank account. This makes checking the bank statements easy.
1518|overall very good , only flaw is internet rooter not strong enough.
1519|The Utility Warehouse is a great service which makes the controlling of your finances and the amount of energy used, easy to monitor. All my services are with the utility warehouse including my land line phone and 3 mobile phones.The only downfall I find with the service is tat it can be difficult to call Utility warehouse and actually speak to a person.Generally, this is a great service.
1520|Great response, all sorted. The service is so good you can almost see the smiles on the centre personnel's faces!
1521|I have been with Utility Warehouse for many years.I particularly like the one itemised invoice each month, rather than payments that used to go out at different times of the month,if ever I have to call about any utility I have a query or problem with, it is answered quickly,politely and efficiently.Recently I have experienced glitches on my computer, and each time I have received a quick response  which is generally dealt with whilst I am on the phone and has been sorted remotely so that I can see what is being done and each step is explained to me.I am extremely happy with the overall service and always pass on details to friends.
1522|Not that I have to get in touch with these guys often but when I do I have absolutely exceptional customer service. They have answered my calls within a couple of minutes. On some occasions seconds. This was to find out some tech question about mobile phone. Very impressed and would certainly recommend these guys to anyone. Even just for the customer services. Price is exceptionally cheap to. Cash back card for my groceries and fuel and Christmas shopping pays for more than half of my winter bills! 
1523|We have been with Utility Warehouse for several years and would recommend all our friends to enroll and use your facilities The service is excellent 
1524|Prices are competitive, monthly statements clear and concise.  The on-line and internet experts were patient and knowledgable when I needed them.  I would always recommend the U W.
1525|I have all 4 gas electric phone and broadband and have been a member for 10 years I have tryed on and of to find anther company as switching is often sensible as yet have not found a company that can bet the utility warehouse I am a member of which so called them they said stay were you are you'll not do better do thank you Utility Warhouse :-)so the price is very good the people have been helpfull 
1526|I have found that buying through this system I get what I want at the best prices around, quality & speed of service, available knowledge to help you through what it is you are here for and customer care & the ability to communicate  is paramount as far as I am concerned.  Thank you for allowing me to promote.
1527|We've been using Utility Warehouse for 9 years & have been delighted by their service and their prices. When I've had need to call them, the phone has usually been answered in under 15 seconds, which is hours away from the responsiveness I've had from other utility providers. Taking their full package of services provides opportunities for savings and convenience that no other company can hope to match! I love having a single bill, single direct debit, and one point of contact rather than 4 or 5. Using their Cashback card means we get an additional GBP20-GBP40 off our bill each month, which I think is quite phenomenal. 
1528|I asked to change banks for depositing money onto my cashback card, the girl i spoke to was polite friendly and very efficient, the task was done immediatley, i was very happy.
1529|I have been a customer of the Utility Warehouse for several years and have not found another service provider who can match it. The costs of gas and electricity are very competetive.Phone and internet connection are also excellent value and the mobile phone GBP10 per month deal appears to be the best available for a low user such as me. I cannot think of anything that I do not like other than perhaps the shape of the monthly bill which opens in the opposite way to a normal leaflet or book.Changing the level of monthly budget payments could not be easier - just a phone call to discuss the issue.  
1530|We have been with utility warehouse for nearly 2 years & have never had a problem. We have moved house & even had to have a new phone line installed for the broadband & utility dealt with it all. I ger a text message to say when my bill is due & for how much. You can up or down your direct debit payment as & when you need to. Never had any issuse with them
1531|I had problems with my computer connection.. couldn't get online at all, Utility Warehouse were quick to come out and investigate my problem which turned out to be a damaged phone line further down the road from me, it took time to get BT out to check and mend the line and overall I was without a connection for 3 weeks almost.. during which UW were in constant contact updating me on progress and enquiring weather the promised work had been done.The strange thing is when ive had trouble like this in the past when I was with other internet providers they failed to overcome the problem down the line, which has been my reason for dropping them as my IP.I cannot praise this company enough, good service at a cheap price and loads of ways to save even more money.  Thankyou UW 
1532|Recently changed supplier of my gas and electric to Utility Warehouse . They did everything for me and the transaction was done smoothly. All contact I have had with their company and staff as been outstanding .What a relief to be with a supplier that cares. Looking forward to easy bills you can understand . Thank you all !!!!!!
1533|Initially had problems with my mobile but one phone call to my contact and they went into over drive an solved everything for me.  Nothing is or was too much trouble even when my Broadband refused to play the game as well. Everything is now up and running happily.Have since starting, had my first monthly bill with savings right across the board - electricity - broadband - landline and mobile.Wish I had heard of Utility Warehouse years ago.  Thank you for finding me.
1534|THE BEST THING I DID WAS TO CHANGE TO THE UTILITY WAREHOUSE AND I DO RECOMEND THEM.WE HAVE ALL SREVICESGAS ELECTRICITY MOB PHONE MAIN PHONE 7 BROADBAND AND WE ARE SO SO PLEASED.
1535|As elderly members, my wife and I particularly value the advantages of everything paid monthly to one source.   The Cash back card is another benefit and again is received monthly.But most of all we value the highly professional yet comfortably friendly manner of whoever answers the telephone, it seems to be endemic throughout the business, always helpful.  Whatever the question it is answered immediately or rapidly transferred while explaining why, to whom and the time to hold in the case of any delay.We have now discovered how simple it is to use the online reporting of Gas and Electricity meter readings, much easier than the major suppliers.     We would suggest that membership could be an advantage to busy people with no time to waste and certainly elderly folk who want to spend their time  enjoying the things they like rather than formidable paperwork. 
1536|Salespeople always back off whenever I'm stopped in the street to ask who my supplier is, as they always confirm that Utility Warehouse can't be beaten on price.
1537|Staff are so good,knowlegable,courtious,and polite.It's a pleasure talking to them.Mostly you come off the phone very satified with your problem solved.
1538|I find that whenever I have a problem its solved quichkly and with politeness I have all the services they provide and i am very happy
1539|I am so glad that I changed to 'Utility Warehouse', particularly with my phone and broadband as I am now paying about half what I was with B.T. and get to speak to advisors who I am actually able to understand!  I asked a silly question about my mobile but was at no point made to feel stupid or a nuisance, which does sometimes happen when you get older! Advisors are polite, clear and informative. 
1540|I would recommend this company to any of my friends & family witch I have already done & they have been very pleased with the result.
1541|I was with British Gas until I joined you a few years ago. They wanted to put my monthly payment up by quite a bit, fortunately my son had joined your supply, and I  joined as well, and have never looked back, I am paying less now that I was 3 years ago with British Gas. Keep up the good work. It is very easy you just take a meter reading on the last day of the month(I have forgotten a few times, then just estimate the use them), phone it in and Bobs your uncle. I am very happy with Utility Warehouse.
1542|One of the best things about UW is that I can budget correctly and pay monthly for electricity used.  There are no bad surprises at the end of a quarter and I can build up a credit balance to use, if like last winter, I needed extra warmth to keep me cosy without worrying that I am going to be in debt.Easy to use phone in system for giving my readings  -  the only thing is I have to remember to ring on the last day of the month!
1543|The staff really went out of their way to try and pin point the fault over the phone before calling in the repair men - this may have taken slightly longer to sort out the problem but they always called back when asked to no matter what the time was which was more convenient to me. They were always polite and courteous. If there is a fault I can pick on it is that it does take a while for them to answer on the first call before they answer but, once they do answer, on reflection to their thoroughness and service you get, you can then understand why it does take a few minutes for them to answer.I have used this company for my utility services for a few years now and although some companies come close I'm happy to stay where I am for the time being
1544|I like the fact that all my utilities are dealt with and they are always ready to help with any questions.  I have had an hour of advice and explanation when I had computer problems.   I also have all my bills listed together and know when the gas and electricity are up or down according to the weather.  All in all its a comfortable and efficient organisation.   PS I'm moving back to Surrey very soon.
1545|I have saved a lot of money since I changed to Utility Warehouse thank you 
1546|The Utility Warehouse Customer Service department are a shining example to all the other so called Customer Service departments we have to deal with in our daily lives. Their service personnel are extremely helpful, polite and professional, a real pleasure to deal with. 
1547|Fantastic customer service. I didn't have to hold for ages to get through which was great. Once I spoke to the customer service adviser they took on board my query and dealt with it in a professional manner.I particularly like the fact that the call center is based in the UK.I cannot praise this company enough and all that they offer!!
1548|the few times i needed help with the internet, i was always given patient and helpful advice that led to a good outcome.
1549|We have been with UW for the last 15 months.  The change over was painless and the representative took charge of all aspects.  The monthly billing statement is clear and provides you with a complete picture of your account, charges and credit/debit situation.We have had no issues whatsoever.  We like the 'no tie' in aspect of the contract.  If you are prepared to submit monthly readings you receive a 10% refund each year which we were delighted to have in July.
1550|Cannot praise utility Warehouse enough. I am no longer stressed out with paying bills and know that I am getting the best deals. I would recommend Utility Warehouse to anyone and have done so...even my bank manager changed to them after I spoke to her! There is nothing I don't like about them.
1551|I like the way I can speak to someone if there is a problem also I find giving the monthly readings for gas and electric it keeps you more into what you use rather than every three months with the other companies.  your broadband and telephone service is also very good.
1552|its good to have home phone/broadband gas/electric WHEN YOU PHONE THEM IT IS  THE BEST  SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD  /AND 1 BILL A MONTH IS GOOD THE BILL IS PUT IN A WAY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND AND IF YOU NEED HELP THEY ARE JUST A CALL AWAY   THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT ARE GOOD THE MEMBER SERVICES IF YOU HAVVE TO TALK TO SOMEONE IT TAKES LESS THAN A 60 SEC. AND GOOD AND THAT WHY I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM AND WE ARE SO GLAD WE LEFT THE 3 BIG COMPANYS THAT WE WAS WITH FOR FORTY YRS 
1553|This provider is so much cheaper than my last one and has a few perks as well, such as a cashback card. The thing that sets this above the rest for me is their customer services. Even though I messed them around recently they still remained charming, polite and helpful and I'm just so glad that I've switched to them
1554|best move ever for great savings on electricity, very flexible for direct  debits for electric bills.Broadband reasonable and any problems quickly sorted.Phone and mobile bills also greatly reduced from previous supplier.cash back card a great idea for savings and easily loaded on lineweb site easily accessed e-mails are as one would expect with spam detect or working well.It pays to take a gas/electric/phone/ etc package and a 5 item version is the best and cheapest.Staff are always very helpful and pleasant and make you feel valued.1 single bill covers all items which makes life easier.
1555|Excellent service from friendly, knowledgable and polite staff, who are interested in giving you the best service available in the U.K.
1556|Whenever I phone UW which is often, I am always asked by everybody how I am. The staff are always very helpful, friendly and understanding. No matter who  have spoken to they always have been able to answer any queries I have in a professional manner. I cannot praise the team on the telephony side of the business enough, as I have had some problems with my internet for several month's and each member of staff have had the patient of a saint with both myself and husband as neither of us are very technical where phones and internet are concerned.  
1557|I've been quite happy with the service in terms of the Gas and Electricity supplies but the telephone and internet service was not so good. This may have been due to my line being faulty. Many requests to rectify this were responded to but the problem was not solved.Switching to another provider did bring a resolution to this problem. My line speed has gone from less than one Meg: to more than 12Meg.
1558|I have been a Utility Warehouse customer for about 8 years now and get my electricity, gas and landline phone through them.  I am always confident that I am getting good prices on these services and am frequently surprised at how low my bills are.The most important thing however; is their service which is really outstanding.  As usual there are a few buttons to get to the right service but once you do in my experience you are greeted by a native English speaker who always seems to be really focussed on resolving your issue.  They people I have spoken with are approachable, helpful and often humorous.  What a difference to so many call centres - on this alone I would say it's worth swapping to Utility Warehouse!!
1559|I've been with Utility Warehouse for years (gas, electric, phone & broadband). After I decided to get my phone and broadband services somewhere else they turned really nasty! The worse customer service I've ever experienced: I've had a fault with my gas meter, they never send an engineer when they say. I then cancelled my direct debit and they still used my bank details to take a payment from my account, without my authorisation, which is stealing! When you mange to talk to them they are rude, refuse to put you through a manager, don't call you back when they say they would, they blame everyone else (it's never their fault!)... Join them at your own risk, but beware, as soon as something goes wrong you're on your own and will end up paying loads more. I can't wait for my gas meter to be fixed to leave them for good. I would be happy to pay more for my bills somewhere else, but in fact I'll be paying less, considering the amount of time off work I've had to take for nothing because they're simply USELESS AND INCOMPETENT!
1560|I was recommended to utility ware house by three separate people and for the past 2years they have been nothing short of excellent. They always answered any query I had and my bills were right every month!I would highly recommend them to anyone  and have done so!
1561|having had one or two difficulties setting up a wwifi connection the technical department were absolutely fantastic in talking an ancient 80 yr old through the remedy.The help one obtains from the membership service is always very patient and accommodating for older people, not something one encounters all the time elseware.
1562|I would not recommend The Utility Warehouse as a gas and electiricy supplier to my worst enemy.  They may be good at answering the phone but that is about as far as it goes.  Try getting your direct debit reduced when you are overpaying - try getting them to put you on the correct tariff for your usage - you will experience a completely different attitude then.  The best of all is if you pay them by card over the phone they then help themselves to your money by debiting your account without your permission the next time a bill becomes due - they don't bother to notify you in advance or ask you for permission in fact they don't even advise you that they have stored your card details for future use or ask you for permission to do so - no, nothing as upfront and transparent as that for this bunch - they simply take it as and when they choose on random dates.  Do not switch to this supplier - you will be making a costly mistake.
1563|The phone was answered very quickly and My query was sorted out immediately.  The resolution was implemented with no cost to myself.  Fantastic service Utility Warehouse, thank you 
1564|My housemate & I have recently moved into a flat which was using Utility Warehouse for electricity & internet/telephone.As we had never heard of the company we rang them up 2 days after moving in & requested an information pack etc. After waiting around 10 days this never arrived. We rang again - queried the costs of electricity & internet - felt it sounded an unsually good deal & queried why Utility Warehouses costs were quite so low - we were informed this is because they don't spend money on advertising campaigns so no one knew of the company which although a slightly odd response we again requested an information pack. We were informed this was to be sent second class post. This took 10 days to arrive. It didn't include all of the information we asked for. On ringing for a third time we were informed that the telephone line had been deactivated & it would cost GBP70 to reinstall this as well as the other costs previously quoted. My housemate began to complain about this & was informed that as the call centre was closing they could discuss this no further & that the complaints department are only available Monday-Friday. Today we received a relatively aggressive letter stating we have 7 days from the date of the letter (marked 6 days ago) to pay a GBP200 electricity deposit 'which we haven't paid'. On not one of the three phonecalls were we advised of this nor in the information pack we requested. We will be ringing first thing on Monday to formally complain & request compensation. In answer to our previous question as to why Utility Warehouse costs are so low we suggest it is because they try & make money from unsuspecting people in ridiculous & unfair ways. I would far rather pay a higher fee with a recognised company I can trust than deal with this company ever again. Please don't be seduced by the low costs. 
1565|A very very good company with good UK Customer Service. Every time i have called the phone was answered literally in seconds. Nothing has been too much bother. There were various issues with my new house due solely down to Talk Talk having messed up the phone lines and trying their usual tactics to keep customers bound in by difficult circumstances. This was no issue with utility warehouse as the customer service was outstanding. One call and they literally did sort everything out. An area manager even hand delivered a temporary wireless router that runs off of the mobile networks to use free of charge until the problem, which wasn't even their fault, was resolved. Absolutely fantastic company and the cheapest rates and best service by far. It makes such a difference not having the stress of dealing with these companies and trusting all services to one good and honest provider. Top Job!
1566|My wife signed us up to UW for gas, electricity and phone. I was sceptical, thinking it seemed a bit like a 'discount club' rather than a professional utility provider. Over the last couple of years we have had good service with no problems. I recently switched my BT Infinity Fiber broadband connection over to UW, qualifying for their gold status for taking 4 services. The current offer also means I get an unlimited up to 80Mb internet connection for just GBP13 for the first three months and a free wireless router. This seems like a pretty identical service to BT Infinity for half the price. The lady in the call center that I spoke to was very friendly and really sorted out my order and questions. Very pleased with UW.
1567|STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY We have a week old baby and the pre-payment card meter went wrong last night just after 6pm leaving us with no gas, tried phoning the utility warehouse to find no out of hours emergency number! The message only relates to a gas escape. Phoned them again after they opened in the morning - yes they would get an engineer out. At 4.30 in the afternoon still no sign, so phoned them again. Apparently the job didn't go through??? but by 6pm an engineer from G4S turned up. He said the meter needed to be replaced and I need to contact my supplier for them to be able to do this - BUT THERE IS NO OUT OF OFFICE CONTACT NUMBER!!! He said you need to contact your gas supplier. He then found out for me it was a company called 'GAS PLUS SUPPLY LTD'. An hour later after searching through the web with no luck and finding a piece saying that N Power had brought the company out??? I phoned them (yes they have an out of hours service :-) ) No luck there as they had never heard of them?? But they did give me G4S contact number which I duly rang, to be told they couldn't do anything until I had contacted my supplier BUT THERE IS NO OUT OF OFFICE CONTACT NUMBER!!! I was then told to contact the gas emergency services - I explained what had happened and that I have a WEEK OLD BABY to be told I had to contact my supplier BUT THERE IS NO OUT OF OFFICE CONTACT NUMBER!!! We can't help he said!! I have now got to wait until tomorrow morning to get the meter sorted out - Dam good job we are not in the middle of winter!!!! Needless to say I am now going to change my supplier!!!
1568|I have never found a company so good. The staff are so helpful cant do enough to make you feel important ,and being on pension the prices are fantastic couldn't find better. I'm always telling everyone how good UWH is . Thank you .
1569|Absolutely appalled by the service.Have been overcharged every month, there were hidden costs in the contract, as well as mysterious extra VAT.There cancel 'any' time is misleading, as I'm now being charged for an extra month without using the service.I do not recommend.
1570|This company is a disgrace, our tennant moved out of our house and it remained empty for 6 months, they sent various bills up to around GBP1000 to GBP600, I asked them to check the meter. They wouldn't !!! Our electric was switched off at the fuse box so nothing was being used, As far as we are concerned we owe them nothing So we battled with them for two years and went into deadlock, I refused to pay for somthing I have never used! Another 3 years go by all quiet thinking it had all ended then pow! Solicitors letters and now being threatened with court! So the battle will start again , they will not be getting away with it , I have read all over the web that this is a common thing that hey do to genuine folk, They even had proof from us that the house was empty and unoccupied , so watch out NEVER EVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM!!!!!!!!
1571|I have been a customer for over 3 years as their utility prices are better than the competition. I called them this week because I could not use my PAYG mobile phone last year in Europe and I am going to Europe again later this year.Their customer operative was polite and very helpful in explaining how to use the phone overseas. He also told me the rates for texting, calls etc.I am a very happy customer.
1572|Have been with Utility Warehouse for over 10 years now and take 5 services from them. They continue to provide a very good service and I've never been tempted to switch supplier, as they consistently get very good ratings in Which Magazine. All my queries have been very efficiently and courteously answered to my complete satisfaction. To the best of my knowledge they provide one of the most cost effective services in the utility supplies market and I have no problem with recommending them to anyone.
1573|"I've been a Gold member with UW for over a year now (elec, gas, phone, broadband), and a quick online comparison showed that 49 other tariffs would be cheaper than mine for dual fuel on the amounts I actually use. The phone/broadband is cheap, but still Plusnet is cheaper. Prices are quoted ex VAT which gives a false impression of value. Also, the ""10% discount for first 12 months"" is misleading; you, in theory, receive that as a payment at the end of 12 months, but the qualifying conditions are so complicated I doubt many people actually get it. I've given meter readings every month yet they weren't at quite the right time so I miss out on GBP90 :-(Yes, they answer the phone quick, but it's not free if you're on an online tariff. They are very slow to respond to emails. Most of all, information online is very limited (for example, finding details of tariffs is impossible) and you never get email prompts that could be helpful (like telling you exactly when to give your meter readings so that you qualify for the 10% discount). So, OK if you just want a simple life, but not if you want to save as much money as possible."
1574|The ethos of the company is perfect - keep everything simply - provide ex excellent service and offer good value.  On the few occasions that I've needed help or clarification on my account nd so needed to speak to a member of staff I've spoken to a service representative in the UK who understood immediately what I was after and offered a solution.  I love the idea that all of my utilities are shown on one statement making it very easy to keep track of household expenses.
1575|The service utility warehouse have to offer is excellent. The staff are extremely helpful and have obviously been trained to a very high standard. I have only contacted them a couple of times since changing in October last year from BT which was a complete disaster. There were frequent problems in connecting to the Internet that incurred lengthy calls being diverted to India, again completely unsuccessful as the problem was only ever resolved for a very short time, after following instructions in order to perform various checks etc.from a person speaking very poor English on numerous occasions. Well done utility warehouse keep up your good service.
1576|I have had dealings with many customer service operatives but my experience with Utility Warehouse has been absolutely outstanding by far. The longest I have had to wait has been 2 minutes. I have had to ring Their customer service team on several occasions to answer my queries, and on each occasion I have found the operatives to be polite, knowledgeable and happy to help.I have nothing but praise for Utility Warehouse and would definitely recommend this company to my family and friends.It made me feel as if I was talking to a friend, whereas with most customer service teams you can't wait to get off the phone, i could have gladly stayed on the phone talking. Thank you Utility Warehouse for the outstanding service that I received. 
1577|After 12 months with this company, I have paid 50% more in the 12 months than with bt. I moved out of my property 4 months ago and thought I would be in so much credit because of not using any energy. I have calculated these figures with bt from the year before plus out of the 12 months, I have only used 8 months energy. The person that moved into my house called me to say that she was contacted from utility warehouse and said that she must stay with them and that she owes them money asking her for credit details. keep away from this company, I have lost a lot of money, there should be tighter controls regarding the law on companies like this.
1578|"I've been a customer of the Utility Warehouse for a number of years now.  They don't make exaggerated claims about saving money but simply give you the best rate possible for your utilities.  There are no hidden charges or a confusing plethora of ""special tariffs"".  What you see is what you get.  I especially like getting all my services on a single  monthly bill which is really convenient and great for budgeting. If ever I have to contact Customer Services, I never wait longer than 30 seconds before speaking to someone who can deal with my query straightaway. In sum, good products on a single monthly bill and brilliant customer services makes me a happy customer."
1579|When I had a problem with my phone line they were extremely helpful . I rang in the morning at 8 , and an engineer was at my house by 3 pm .
1580|I have been with the utility warehouse for over 4 years, I get my gas, electric, phone, mobile phone and broadband and I have a cash back card, when I use my cash back card my bills are reduced and sometimes I've paid as little as GBP45 for everything for a month and I'm quite a heavy user, when I first was approached buy a friend about it I was sceptical as you are when you don't see major advertising on TV but my friend explained this is how they can keep there prices low, so I thought with out contracts I will give it a go for my energy, the prices were OK I saved about GBP10 so over the year I was saving GBP120.Then I looked into it a bit further and noticed there home phone was cheaper than I was paying so I switched to them saving GBP3 a month so an extra GBP36 a year, now I'm up to GBP156 a year, then broadband which was GBP6 cheaper than my sky a month so that's and GBP72 a year :) and then I added a mobile phone to the account saving GBP11 a month so without me actually using my cash back card I am GBP360 a year better off :) now with my cash back card I generate around GBP40-GBP50 a month off my bill at first I didn't think I would use it but every time now I decide I need to buy something I think where do I get cash back from that sells it and how much will I get back from using my card :)I understand that the utility warehouse may not be for everybody in there current circumstances but nobody is there just a lot cheaper than my previous suppliers and that's perfect for me.I have read a few review's on here and there seem's to be a member that like's to argue with everybody's opinion, you maybe disgruntled with the company but everybody has the right to there own opinion and they shouldn't be challenged on it, this is a review site and not an argument site.
1581|Your staff go the extra mile to help with any problems they take the time to explain and make sure you are all ways clear and understand their answers.This is customer care at its best,Well done to you all.May i say that i can honestly say that there nothing that i dislike Thank you for an excellent service.Mrs Valerie Barker
1582|Was with UW for the past year at our old house. Was happy with the service that I received there. Monthly meter readings were super easy to put in online - it literally takes about 1 minute at the end of each month (and if you forget, then they estimate it for your bill and then re-correct amounts for the next time you do submit a reading). We recently moved house, where Eon was the gas and electricity provider. I just received a 'welcome pack' (more of a threatening letter from Eon saying that I better call them immediately if I dont want to pay for what the last tenants used) and couldnt believe the prices that they charge for their daily 'standing charge'. In addition to the usage rates (which are comparable to most energy suppliers that I've compared: BG, Swalec, Utility Warehouse), but their daily rate of 27p for each the gas and electricity is almost double what BG and Swalec charge (about 16p per day). I pulled out an old bill from Utility Warehouse to see how it compared. Utility warehouse standing charges are GBP3/month for electricity and GBP1.40 for gas. At the Eon price, I would be paying over GBP16/month just for the privilege of having them supply me energy (in addition to my usage). Happily called Utility Warehouse to transfer my new home's energy to them and had a lovely 15 minute phone call with a customer service rep who did the transfer no problem. Now I just have to wait the 4-6 weeks that it takes to transfer companies (they do all the hard work for me!) and I look forward to saving money again with Utility Warehouse! Would definitely recommend!
1583|The service I have received has always been excellent. The advisors I spoke with were very helpful, friendly and answered any queries I raised efficiently. I would most absolutely recommend this company to anybody.
1584|Anyone who uses Utility Warehouse is a fool. Their trick is to suddenly say that you have underpaid for 2 years and hit you with a new invoice for a couple grand. A cursory review of costs indicate that they are in any case expensive. Their employees are half wits and just argue; no doubt because they are in on this. Give these people a wide berth.
1585|I have been a Utility Warehouse Customer for nearly 5 years , I have all four services  with them . I pay for my utilities as I use them every month  just give them your Gas and Electricity meter reading on line that way you never have a huge bill and you never fall behind with your payments and end up in debt.... I have found Utility Warehouse by far the cheapest Service provider going.... The biggest bill I have had in one month for all 4 services was GBP241 it was only that high due to the bad snow we had !!!! When I was with  separate utility providers I was paying : Gas GBP120 per month : Electric GBP100 : BT GBP45 Aol: GBP17 Total every month = GBP282 on  a regular payment plan.....My smallest bill with utility Warehouse was GBP120 for all 4 services !!!!  I have recommended Utility Warehouse to loads of family and friends and they to enjoy having more money a month to spend on the kids or trips out !!!! 
1586|I have been taking gas, electric, mobile phones, landline and broadband from Utilities Warehouse. The prices are kept low. I find it amusing when I get sales calls for other suppliers and I mention I'm with them and they normally hang up.Nice to speak to customer services in the UK too!Finally, very much like the fact I'm only paying GBP7.50 a month for my mobile

1588|I was introduced to Utility Warehouse by a friend. I was very impressed with the presentation and as it happened I found I could save money with the company. I took 4 services Energy, home phone and BB. All in all I saved around GBP50 a month. I also had the cashback card which saved me money too. My dealings with their Head Office have always been efficient and friendly and my queries have been dealt with promptly. I would not hesitate to recommend this company and I would not switch to anyone else. I rate this company 10/10.
1589|Please avoid utility warehouse they are far more expensive than any other because the bill is a lie.
1590|Reading through the reviews on here I'm really surprised by the negative ones! We're been customers since April this year, and so far we're really impressed. We have definitely saved money, it has been a hassle free process to change over.....although our previous Gas supplier at first objected to the transfer (Our fault as we owed a couple of months payments). We ended up taking all 5 utilities, I was stuck in a mobile contract and had lived with a phone I hated with a passion so was grateful Utility Warehouse paid to get me out of that contract. We were kept in the light with what was happening all through the change over process, which was nice. I have had to phone customer service a couple of times, the calls were answered extremely quickly....like within seconds! The person I spoke to both times was upbeat, happy and very useful. The main benefit of Utility Warehouse for us has definitely been the cashback card, it is awesome. Twice we have wiped our bills out completely...with buying birthday presents, decorating materials and stuff, which are things we would have been buying anyway. Anyways, a highly impressed, happy Utility Warehouse household here. Definitely recommend. 
1591|I was recently asked if I would like to save money on my monthly utility bills, to which I answered 'of course but there is no chance that will happen as I KNOW I have the cheapest as I'm constantly researching'. To my surprise (and slightly gutted to be proven wrong) I managed to save GBP297 a year!! I also benefit from things that I did not have before with British Gas and BT, like unlimited anytime calls to USA, France and Spain (which we call alot). I was also given upto GBP200 to get me out of my mobile contract to which I had 6 months left which saved me a further GBP102 as I reduced my bills by almost half and I get unlimited calls and texts instead of just 600mins, which was a bit of a bonus! I was a little sceptical about the cashback card however, my wife does the shopping at M&S; and fortunately there is a sainsburys petrol station round the corner from there, so I believe we get 5% cashback with the card in M&S; and 3% cashback on the petrol at sainsburys, which works out to be about an extra GBP28 saving a month with our spending. The best thing is we are about to buy a new kitchen from B&Q; and I've calculated that I will recieve around GBP170 cashback which means at least 1 months bill is totally free!!So far so good, I have had to call the customer services once to ask about something and to hear my call would be put through in 15 seconds was quite impressive (ended up being 5 seconds..)I was just going to take 4 services (gas, elec, phone and broadband) to get the benefits of being a gold member but ended up having the mobile as well.I would normally be the first to criticise but up to now I am thoroughly impressed and would highly recommend to those thinking about using Utility Warehouse. 
1592|Yesterday bailiffs broke into my son's house while he was at work on instruction from Utility Warehouse. They said they had a CCJ to READ the meter!. My son has paid all his bills on time. Utility Warehouse claim that they had sent him letters about reading the meter. No letters were received. He was called away from work 30 miles away at 1pm to find that they had employed a locksmith to pick lock to gain entry to his home JUST TO READ THE METER!KEEP AWAY FROM UTILITY WAREHOUSE
1593|I have been a customer and a distributor of the club for about 4 years now. I have seen so many changes with the club that i am amazed how the club comes out with such brilliant ideas. No wonder it has earned such third party credibility. I have saved huge amount of money by being a customer and am on the way of creating a fantastic future by helping others save money.Its a Win Win situation always.Would recommend to anyone and everyone. 
1594|Cash back card is a really great way to reduce your utility costs. Many major stores and online shopping too.You can earn between 3% and 7% cash back with everyday shopping.Customer services are all uk based and always eager to help.I have been a customer for 7years and go on reccomendingUtilitywarehouse to friends and family with confidence.
1595|My wife and I joined The Utility Warehouse discount club on 2/8/10 due to a recommendation from a church minister.We had been with the big names for our energy and broadband,home phone and mobiles for many,many years and assumed that they all charge similar prices.To say I was pleasantly surprised by our first UW bill is an understatement,because they guaranteed cheapest prices for all our utilities and gave us a cash back card which meant that our everyday shopping including petrol paid for 25% of our monthly bill and has done every month over the last 3 years.No other company does this,I recommend them to everyone as its a no brainier. 
1596|Jayne and Dirk Spanier love The Utility Warehouse. We discovered this amazing British Plc almost a year ago and this year have saved around GBP600 on our essential utilities,Phone Broadband, Gas Electricity and mobile and it all comes clearly itemised on one simple monthly bill. Their cash back card has saved us a further average of 5-7% THE MAJOR HIGH ST STORES even pay part of your bills and we have  2000 online partners including Airlines, one of my customers saved GBP75 in May she booked a flight for her family to Florida and got GBP75 off her  May bill. UNBELIEVABLE !!!     BUT FACT!!!       NO CONTRACT!    What are you waiting for it doesn't get any better.Who offers that???? Also they offer a fantastic future for anyone motivated and driven who would like to earn money by helping people save money. Life's a Beach!
1597|Does what it says on the tin... very reliable. 
1598|"Let me say first of all yes i am a distributor for utility warehouse and yes i am also a very happy customer but thats not to say there haven't been a few hiccups along the way, but to be fair in all the calls i've had to make to them i've always have a happy, helpful person in the uk not india on the other end of the phone and all my issues have been resolved satisfactorily.  I rarely do this review thing but i happened to fall across this website tonight and have spent a good while looking through lots of reveiws.I have to say i was a bit disheartened when i saw the unhappy customers but having mosied on over to the likes of british gas and the other well known suppliers reveiws, i think we are coming out pretty much o.k.I guess it really does go to show people are far quicker to say bad things before they will praise a company.UW may have fallen out with a few bad payers who have left them debt but for every unhappy customer there are probaby 100 happier ones, judging the other reveiws i don't think other companies would have the same ratio's. Who else offers the ease of 1 bill, a uk based call centre, 10% back on your energy after 12 months, free calls that actually are free (you don't pay 3.50per month hidden in your tarrif)and a cashback card that pays you for doing shopping whether you like it or not. With the help of my solar panels my last 2 bills have actually given me a credit back to my account as the cashback has been more than what my bill amounted to, had i paid the full amount my bill would be around GBP100 per month a 3 bed semi gas/elec/home phone/broadband/mobile i think that's pretty oustanding All companies contually battle for top spot but at the end of the day you get the same gas coming out of you fire or cooker no matter who's logo is printed on your bill the question is do you want to hand you hard earned cash to a faceless company who line the pockets of famous people with millions of pounds for advertising or someone who gives their profits back to ""the little people"" If you have come here considering joining UW all i can say to you is don't knock it till you've tried it "
1599|after two years with no problems, I decided to switch to U W for mobile phone, tried to talk to someone about getting service started, the instructions were to put new sim card (I Phone 5) into old phone (HTC Wilfire) totally different size of card so impossible to download info. Several times I called helpline and on instruction to wait for an adviser was constantly cut off. Four days with no mobile, out of town on business and house on Market. I was told a reply would be given in two working days, didn't happen. Eventually talked to an adviser who was simply going by the book, as I requested in view of inconvenience that some kind of compensation be made, shortly after phone was ordered they were offering one month free, was told this couldn't be done. Also requested feedback, was told this couldn't be done either.  Utility warehouse have let me down badly in this instance, with hindsight would not have switched mobile phone. Seriously considering a different supplier on completion of house sale.
1600|I have now been a customer of the Utility Warehouse for 2 years and have found them to be very cheap and for once I have finally got a customer service office who actually are helpful. I particularly like how simple their price plans and having one bill for all of the services, saves me so much time. Would happily recommend them to anyone looking for a good utility or phone/broadband supplier
1601|Thanks to a friend we saved GBP700 a year from the usual rip of merchants! and great service! 
1602|Anyone who has worked in telephony should know that CLID is now pretty much an open standard - it was openly disclosed and decoded a long time ago. The original dialler can choose to with-hold their number if they so choose, but in my view if they choose to present their number then it should be trasmitted end-to-end. However, there are providers who choose to actively with-hold/delete such data, unless you pay them a monthly charge. Stand up, Utility Warehouse! You are one of those. I hope you voluntarily send money back to the diallers who wanted to present their number; they may be paying call setup charges which might include a charge for transmitting CLID (however hidden it might be).
1603|I have been a customer of The Utility Warehouse Discount Club for just under 3 years now and the savings that I have made during this time period...by switching all my services, home phone, broadband, gas, electricity and mobile means I have saved enough to go on holiday to Malta for a week. Earning between GBP20-GBP50 a month off my utility bill each month using the cash back card (works like an oyster card) doing my normal everyday shopping........ has helped me to accumulate just over GBP1,000 of savings. Great easy one bill for all the services, meaning my paperwork is always handy and in order, without having to try and find a bill for each  service provider. Thanks for the free holiday :)
1604|best company (by them),just don't know for what,best for lying,best cheating.
1605|They offer geat value for money and I love having everyting on one bill. Their customer service is London based and generally very good. Of course, they get things wrong sometimes but they usually try to put it right. Would happily recommend. 
1606|I joined UW upon insistence of a friend who is an agent for them. I was reluctant to leave my O2 internet service. First problem, my internet connection kept dropping off, never happened with O2. It took them a week to decide that I needed a new router, and that didn't solve the problem, they kept saying it was problem in my end. Finally they sent me a new router. Anyway, before the problem was resolved I received a letter saying that if I don't return the router I would be charged GBP 35. I had to send the router with my own money, and never got the promised refund, oh and in order to get the refund for sending the router you have to fax them a copy of the delivery receipt. I mean come on!!! No doubt I decided to change supplier, because if they couldn't resolve such a simple problem I couldn't trust them. But worse was to come!!! Having changed to new suppliers UW deceitfully made an erroneous transfer and I had no knowledge of it. When I asked them why they've transferred my supply back to them, they said I asked for it, which I never did,  and apparently  I never wanted to leave them. So I ended up paying lots of extra money and no acknowledgement that they cheated me. Take my advice; overall they are cheap, petty and dishonest.
1607|"Impossible to tell if I have saved money, but I fear not - my Direct Debit has yo-yoed with UW between GBP5 !! in October and November - to now receiving a monthly bill of over GBP550 for June! help ! Several times I have phoned to try and get something changed back, only to have the same problem the next month - as if I had never phoned at all...They promised to transfer my phone number from Vodafone - ""simply"" - and cut me off for 11 days - really tough having no mobile servise for that long !When the broadband went down, they advised me that I need to offer 3 consecutive working days when I would be home all mroning so that an engineer might call - we both work, so another 6 phone calls to sort that out, sigh....Horrific - I have now received over GBP90 in unexplained 'reconcilation' charges on my final bill trying to get shot of these amateurs..."
1608|I only go to the bother of writing reviews if the companies are exceptionally good or bad.   This one comes firmly in the bad category.I signed up on 3 May.   Two months later my phone doesn't work, I am still waiting for broadband to be activated and my electricity is being charged at a higher rate than agreed.I refused to pay a monthly fee to avoid being charged for using their 0844 number out of principle.   Bad decision - I have had to call to complain or chase many times.   The average wait for an agent to answer is 6 minutes.   When I use my mobile to call (no choice sometimes as my landline is not working), the average cost is GBP3.40.I don't know if I can get out of this 12 month contract without legal recourse, but I am trying.   Needless to say I will never use this company again.
1609|They added GBP720 to a GBP400 late bill. SHAM SHAM SHAM.I would suggest you use the top 6 and never come close to UW.
1610|I take regular readings, pay on time but recently received a visit from someone chasing a late payment. I paid him there and because I was moving to another supplier and he told me to contact them and tell them that the bill was cleared and I could switch.The new company (Southern Electric who were around 30% cheaper than Utility Warehouse)were unable to take my account because UW had blocked it.I called to ask why and they had added GBP60 to my bill for the visit I had received.I had received no warning letter and I am stuck with them now until I can afford to pay that bill off. They have me over a barrel and were completely unapologetic when I called.Don't touch them with a bargepole.
1611|in all honesty i believe the negative reviews are due to people not giving their meter readings every month. I give my meter readings everytime and my bill is half that what was being charged by british gas. Every service is cheaper then the competition, keep it up. I just hope they keep true to their promise and stay cheap.
1612|I was recommended this company to me by a friend.  I went in for phone broadband and gas and electric, and the super cashback card. We shop at sainsburys and get 3% cashback on groceries and petrol regularly and collect our nectar points religiously!.  After around 6 months i got fed up of orange hiking up my phone tariff as they went along and then wanted to charge me an additional fiver for data tethering services.  I decided to leave them and get a sim only deal from Uitlity warehouse no additional charges and unlimited talk, text and 2gb data for GBP20.00 pound was awesome, so now my wife moved her self from 3 network to UW too and has a sim only deal too as she did not want to tie her self down to a contract abnd liked the deals also.  Our bills are usually around GBP120 to GBP140 a month for all services but we have had some crazy months like the Janurary bill which was GBP33.80 for the lot! mostly due to cash back and a annual return on the energy of 10%.  Most months my cash back totals eclipse what i must pay for my phone and broadband so i get those services technically for free!  And the land line is free 24/7 to all uk landlines and free to 10 countries and my broad band throttles at 10mb!I have never had a contract with them and i find that refreshing, and they are british unlike many of the other lot.  They often pick up the calls in 15 seconds and are mostly well mannered and curtious on the phones.  Cant complain... i really cant.
1613|I've now moved on from them as I was having allot of problem, my bills were getting bigger and not smaller, everytime I was spending allot of time on the phone to them, they kept asking me for meter readings and blaming me for not having given them the right reading, hence the mistakes on my bills. I felt there were winding me up and finally gave up. From now on I will only stick to the major companies who have strict procedures in place that they must follow. 
1614|I am on a low GBP12.00 montly contract as i am currently unemployed so cant afford any more than that. I have just recieved a bill of 800.00 for 2 months ! they are stating i have gone over my allowence which is rubbish as i hardly ever use my phone and certainly not enough for 800 pounds!!!. I recieved my bill which dosen't add up at all i tried ringing customer services for help and they were useless. This is a very very greedy money grabbing company please be aware and don't let them have your money give it to a decent company that actually cares for customers. 
1615|i was looking down at a few of the previous reviews and think theyre all a bunch of rubbish! Ive been with Utility Warehouse for over 2 years now and the only problem I once had was the cashback card and all the bother of topping it up, but recently any customer can spend online and get cashback! I reckon most of the comments below are coming from someone being paid to write negative reviews and make this company look bad. Which? rate Utility Warehouse number 3 and it has been in the top 3 for the past 5 years, rated by GENUINE customers.
1616|"Sales man was very convincing especially when you here those words ""we are number, 1 we are the best, we are the cheapest.So this is what happened to me:-Trick 1:- what ever you pay monthly for your supply now they will lower, this sounds great what they do not tell you is that you will now be in arrears every month as you are not paying for what you use.Trick 2:- They will use a meter reading from your last statement, now you are seriously in arrearsTrick 3 :- Once the amount has built up to a substancial amount or if you move house they will produce an actual meter reading this can be several times more than your monthly or even quartely payment.If you read some of the cases some people have had bills for over GBP2000 and even though they knock this down by half to GBP1000 (guilt maybe) this is still 4 times what the true cost should be, but now you are stuck with them.The above is an account of what has happened to me, They love you to phone them and they will happily spend an hour getting your correct details, debating, chatting the days events and time wasting well at up to 25p per minute at your expense that really sums up what this company is really about.Don't be fooled by the positive reviews, Watchdog recently named and shamed one of the companies that supply and charge for positive reviews to be published.Watch out for them on Watchdog or better still on the news.their day will come"
1617|Gas and electric, phone Internet, and mobile. Take them all! Then if you want them for free take the cash back card which is free. My first bill was -94 Second -57 No wonder they are voted no.1 and are growing at a staggering rate.I see people's complaints on here and I understand the frustration people are under.Keep calm and talk to people in customer service like you want them to help you not shouting at them telling them what they have done wrong.I would and are recommending this to everyone!!
1618|The psychological approach by friends and family members to sign up to this firm stinks.  I do not want family members ringing me up and trying to sell me this rubbish
1619|It's taken me 2 years to get someone to agree to come out and fix the broken meter, which they've conveniently arranged for one week after I move out of the rented flat. They know this and I'm sure have done it deliberately so they have know way of working out my bills properly and don't have to refund me for the absolutely extortionate estimates they have had me on for 2 years.
1620|The most unhelpful company ever! I took out the policy to consolidate my phone and broadband. I have a business downstairs and as a family we live upstairs with children using computer and broadband. I was recommended to put the broadband onto the business line downstairs which meant it struggled to even send an email, let alone try and stream anything 2 floors above, I was sold a mobile phone for the business which had no network coverage, so nobody ever used it, I was still paying another phone provider upstairs but still no broadband. It was a completely missold package that never suited, as I was a business customer I could not get out of the plan unless I paid a large surcharge, so have been desperate to get out. I have voiced my dissatisfaction to UW, who said there was nothing they could do! I thought they were about to over charge me for my last bill so I stupidly cancelled the DD and wanted to check the bill first - they've sent me my final bill with GBP15 charges plus 1% late payment charge, meaning I now have a ridiculously large bill of GBP55, the largest yet - for a service I cannot use! Absolutely blxxdy ridiculous! 
1621|I had pitch in January and finally had all services transferred, i say it like this as there were some issues and a lot of phonecalls. It strike me after reading the other reviews that it doesnt take much to get people on their soap box, I myself dealt with each problem as it came and then my first bill arrived......I am one of the last customers that could choose Premium and even with that I save GBP4.92 in my first month and with no services live actually got PAID GBP1.48 into my account. Bill 2 a bit different with the services now all live and a new line install charge it was a bit higher than I imagined, was on the phone and the bloke very helpful in sorting out the problem (second bill covered an extra 10 between billing date and payment date)I am happy with the package and my broadband is enough my calls are cheaper and my mobile flexible like me.
1622|Hmmmm something not right about this company! Avoid like the plague is the best advise I can give.Still alot more to find out what is going on with my gas and electric from the ombudsman but I will be back with the full details on how I have a GBP1700 debt from over 2 years yet I have paid 75 a month .only 2 of us and 1 child living in a small semi detached? Try to call U/W for help but they are threatening me with breaking into my home while I'm at work to fit meters. This is going to cost an extra 700 for warrant, locksmith, dog handler ( they heard my dog bark ) !Horrible company! 
1623|If everyone checked with their current supplier for the best rate and what they receive for that price you will find that UW are unable to do better on many of these. Its if you want one large bill to pay at the end of the month or spread your payments with different companies. My Friend has been trying to win me over but when Virgin are better on the mobile contracts and I am on the best price for Gas and Electric with my current supplier I am not gaining. Cant comment on he service they offer but advised to check first before signing over. 
1624|Utility warehouse are scams they told me i could upgrade for free to an iphone. When i received my bill it stated that i was paying a handset charge. When i called them and spoke to a gentlemen by the name of Ron i was told that instead of paying an upfront fee that they would charge me a monthly handset charge. I was disgusted to know that i could have been coned  this way as when i initially took the upgrade i had not been informed by Ron who admitted he had done the upgrade for me of these charges. I am struggling already as it is and am now stuck in a 24 month contract. Livid. 
1625|This company is rude arrogant and money grabbers I moved into property four months ago sent them my tenancy countless of times and still they haven't sorted my account out I'm paying 20 pounds every time I top up gas and electric and they won't lower it have spoken to everyone in there office and still it ain't sorted something needs to be done about this company there jokers 
1626|One star is too much. They sell through local distributors akin to a multi level marketing scheme. They don't deliver the offers they promise and despite the distributor offering the cash back card they refused and were unwilling to offer until 2 months payments had been made.Cheap possibly but the quality of service they suggest just aren't delivered, it's every one else is problem. Nearly 5 weeks on, no response my original complaint or refund.  
1627|Just had an agent trying to sell me this deal, just reminded me of pyramid selling. I have already haggled with my utilities to get the best deal, to go with this company would be to increase my outgoings. When I pointed out my broadband speed was much faster than The Utility Warehouse could provide, she said, yes but do you really need that speed, errr yes especially when its cheaper than you could provide, same with line rental it would be another increase, etc. And why put all your eggs in one basket.
1628|I heard about UWH from a friend and after a lot of looking around and comparing them to other suppliers I realised i couldn't get a better deal. what attracted me most was the cash back card that allowed me to reduce my bills each month. I am now looking forward to Christmas where my challenge is to wipe my monthly bill completely like some of my friends have done!!Bring on Christmas.ps very sad to hear people are having a few issues with this company, everyone i have spoken to things they are really helpful, and i tend to agree.
1629|"im not even a customer yet!! but wont be and thats just because of the sales pitch, i do not take kindly to being called love! told to do it for him! and feel pushed, harassed, bullied and pestered, this treatment drove me to look into y he was so concerned about me joining straight away!! i wonder if its ought to do with the reward he gets for the first 12 customers or the even bigger reward he gets for his first 50 customers! hhmm, makes me think he didnt really mean it when he he said "" i just want to save u money "" haha yeh!"
1630|I 'inherited' Utility Warehouse when moving into my property LESS than a month ago  and I've had trouble with them from the off. Lack of communication between the company, demands for money I don't owe, bailiff letters etc, and countless phonecalls to get it sorted with a more than average hold time! Only saving grace is that the last couple of call handlers I spoke to were extremely apologetic and mananged to finally put me on to the correct people, and thankfully so far this week I haven't received any annoying money demanding letters.  Having heard good things from a couple of people about their 'cheap' cost I was looking forward to using this company, however, now I'm sorry to say I can't wait to change. 
1631|The reviews on this website about the Utility Warehouse are absolutely spot on. They are one of the worse gas and electricity company ever! They have been one big massive headache and nightmare needless to say I've instructed legal aid to help me with them as they have charged me and my family an absolute fortune in gas and electricity. I sincerely hope the people that are with this company to move before they rack charges upon charges on your account, don't ring rather write to them via email or email the CEO be prepared to get a bog standard reply from his PA!Sorry for the rant and good luck to those trying to sort out their problems with UW.
1632|After recent leaving the company as a customer and as a distributor. I think it is important that people are made aware of the realities of UTDC. I would not recommend joining either as a customer or as a distributor, unless you really do want to spend every waking moment of your time selling a product that may lose you some friends. I went all in and got signed up as a customer and distributor, the Broadband was fine until I realized I either had to pay for a router or hire one from them at a premium. In addition if you want the basic features on your service you have to pay for it, unlike other companies. You have to pay a monthly membership fee as a customer and a fee as a distributor. So the company charges you for being with them before you have either made a penny or used the services. I cancelled the service had to pay the notice period which I think was 6 weeks, then a cancellation fee of GBP10 plus Vat and the membership fee, then had to return the modem or pay the fee which adds up to roughly GBP17.The general order of the day is get you in with some excited recruiter, who has no experience with the company at all, then sign you up on a promise then the reality hits. If you just want the service or to make extra money, go some place else. 
1633|Sharp practice and money grabbing. I will never use again.
1634|I had 8oo pound bill for 2 months electric and gas , there rude and arrogant do not use them I would not recomend to anyone now there saying I have to pay late fees as well as I can't find that much money with four kids .
1635|Their customer services department are only open traditional business times, which ddoes not help if you have a 9-5 yourself.  They have not responded to my emails (yet).The bill totals don't always match up with usage + VAT.  The bill does not state where the rest of the total came from, and the customer service agents that I spoke to did not give me a clear answer either.  Whilst waiting for responce to emails they didn't forget to send reminders! 
1636|I switched to UW 6 years ago for gas and electric. I have never had any problems making contact with them (albeit there is usually 3-4 minutes wait). By giving the meter readings every month, I have never had a large fluctuation in my bills which helps my monthly budget. I moved 2 years ago and had no problems with cancelling the old account and starting a new one at the new address. Their prices have risen, but not as quickly and as much as most larger utility suppliers.
1637|"I have just moved into a property that used this provider, and thought I would stay with them as it's easier, NOT!! (Don't ever do that)My partner lucky enough reviewed comments on them beforehand and found allot of VERY unhappy customers.Although we are not using them we had a transitional period b4 we switched.can't ever get through on the phone (your call is 19th in the queue)if you are not getting a cut of signal, you have to hoop jump through around 5 or 6 ""PRESS THIS FOR THIS, AND THAT FOR THAT"", b4 you get told you have a 6 minute wait!!I have tried 13 times today, I JUST WANT TO PAY THE BILL!! Can't do online as they have screwed it up and I have to talk to someone. worst ever."
1638|its a disgrace useless service useless everything dont change people
1639|this company is terrible, we live in a 8 bedroom house which i know is a lot of rooms but the first bill we got through was 1600 a MONTH!!! and everyone i have spoke to is saying this is an out rage, we paid the first month off straight away because we all had a panic attack, then cut down last month and got a bill through for 1700?!?!?!?!?! PLEASE someone help we are been ripped off.
1640|Using Utility Warehouse was the worst mistake i have ever made! After the company charged me the wrong amount for over a year(even though i sent meter reads) i recieved just under GBP500 dept, I understand we had used the electricity so i was fine to set up a payment plan to pay, however they cancelled my payment plan through fault of there own and will not let me set it back up, i now have two options 1. a prepayment meter ( i have a baby in my home!) or 2. pay pull amount or go to court and  they have mentioned to have a warrant out for my arrest!! I have had 3 meetings with citizens advice andd they cannot believe the company wont let me set up my payment plan again, even after speaking to them on two occasions.  How i have been treated is disgusting and i warn people not to even think to join this company! After research i found BBC xray investigated the company for the same sort of problems.
1641|to sum it up utility warehouse has the worst customer service EVER, bills are INCORRECT, have phoned numerous times to question issues and since october 2012 got NOWHERE. each time i phone WEEKLY, always a promise manager will phone back within 24 HOURS, now february still waiting got to the point I'M so stressed and this company DON'T CARE, poor poor poor customer SERVICE. i totally agree with previous COMMENTS, the staff are arrogant and DON'T LISTEN. the basics of customer service is listening SKILLS, my last phone call to utility warehouse resulted in staff cutting my CALL, why i DON'T know cause i WASN'T rude always been polite until NOW. this company should be investigated by ofcom
1642|"Even though UW's gas and electric are sourced from NPower, I believed what a UW rep said about incentives, customer service, and all the 'savings' of collating my land line, BB, mobile, gas and electric to one company.In May 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint that UW mislead customers with the slogan ""The UK's cheapest Home Phone The UK's cheapest Home Phone and Broadband bundle The UK's cheapest Mobile tariffs The UK's cheapest standard Gas and Electricity"" which they could not substantiate.I've had more problems with billing than I ever had with all my previous suppliers put together so if anyone is considering switching ASK FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL CHARGES, PENALTIES, AND FEES FOR EACH OF THE SERVICES THEY ARE INTERESTED IN. Despite asking my distributor on many occasions I still haven't had any such document. They say to contact their 'excellent' support centres. The support centres say I need to speak to my distributor who would 'always be deighted to assist'. My distributor never seems to be available, doesn't return calls to the point where I believe I'd have more chance of finding Lord Lucan.Before you know it, and in my opinion, you're caught in a sticky web of the above thats very, very difficult to get out of.

1644|left the company 2 years ago with no debt left on my gas pre-payment meter now have received a letter from a debt collecting agency demanding GBP110 no-one at utility warehouse can explain why i've got this debt and most of the time you can even get to speak to the relevant department - don't have anything to do with this company
1645|Services - good.Bill - super clear - down to the penny - every month - you know how much you are consuming, how much you are paying, if you are in credit or debit you can re-adjust it straight away. Savings - massive - on shopping as well. I am very happy with them but then again I am a good customer: I pay my bills on time, I give my readings every month and I recommended the company to 4 friends and 2 members of my family. For this the company has is rewarding me every month with a discount on my bill.UW you're the best! So long Npower!
1646|been with them 3 days and they have capped my internet. im on unlimited data plan. dont waste your time or money 
1647|I moved into a rented house in November 2012, and immediately contacted them to let them know that I was living there and to provide initial meter reads, and that's where the problems started. The house used to be part of a factory, where the owners decided to split it. However, I spent 40 minutes on the phone trying to explain this to them. The account was registered as a business account and apparently they can't change it without council tax banding information which wasn't done until December.This made sense, so I waited. I sent them a copy of the tenancy agreement as requested, and on 1st January 2013 sent them the council tax banding, all by email. They claim that because I changed supplier during that period they can't change it. I'm not paying a business tariff for something which isn't a business, so i'm now in dispute with them and going down the complaints procedure.Useless .. AVOID AT ALL COSTS
1648|I have been with The utilities Warehouse for one year.  In this time I have had to telephone Technical support on 3 occasions.On every occasion, I have been listened to,offered advice & help & had a follow up call, to see if I have any problems & to see if I have been satisfied with the service.I have my Gas, Electric, Internet & home phone with Utility's Warehouse . I like the clear easy to understand monthly bills.I also like the cash back card . It really helps keep me in budget & I get cash back as well!I am a very happy customer of  Utility's warehouse.
1649|Having been with these rip off merchants a year now and after THEY have reduced my direct debit 3 times, the last time being early December, they wrote to me to on 31st December 2012 to say that I owed them GBP1109.00 on my electricity account!!!!! And that my direct debit would be going from GBP101.40 a month to GBP271.00 a month!!!!!It seems they can reduce your monthly direct debit to lull you into a false sense of security then slap you with this.PLEASE don't use this company you'll end up in debt!!!!
1650|Can anyone help I have tried all the shops suggested by utility warehouse and none are working, I have been given 3 different numbers now to top up and it keeps failing, has anyone had this problem with their prepaid meters.
1651|we had a gas and electric meter fitted and the gas seems to be going round really fast even when we dont use it we only have heating on for two hours in the morning but electric all lights are on and the meter seems to be normal. The gas just dont seem to last even when we dont use it customer service is very poor and they give different info depending on who you speak to 
1652|They are ok until you come to leave them. They pay you money to join them,and ask you to stay for a year on broadband and phone,when you leave after14 months they demand the money back. There not happy to pay money that was promised to you on electric and gas.You must always check you policy before agreeing to it.You are told one thing then they put down another. It takes them at least 10 minutes to answer the phone,then your on the phone for ages sorting out a simple problem.The customer care goes out the window when you leave.Would never use them again and would never recommend them to anyone.
1653|Utility Warehouse are without a doubt the biggest rip-off there is!  Do not under any circumstances join their wretched little club.  They will deliberately manipulate the figures to make it look as if you are making a saving on your utilities, and then after 3 or 4 months, you suddenly realise that actually you've got a huge debit balance with them and now you can't change providers because you have to pay off the outstanding balance first.  Argue with them, and all they do is offer you GBP10 compensation, and if you ever manage to get the GBP10, you'll find they've deducted VAT from it!  My advice - stay well away from Utility Warehouse at all costs and warn your family and friends to do the same.  They DO NOT save you anything on any of your utilities or your phones.  It might seem convenient to have all your bills paid through one company, but when you examine the cost of each, you'll soon find that its cost you far more than it would have to go to separate suppliers.  
1654|"My services were mobile phone/broadband/home phoneSo it started off that my connection date was set and i was excited by all the low prices and all bills in one idea. 7 days after the connection date i was finally ""connected"" and by connected i mean download speeds of up to 800kbps which is beyond stupid so spent 45 minutes trying to get through to customer service  but to no avail so i waited a further 7 days to see if it improved but in fact its gotten worse, constantly being disconnected every hour or 2 for periods of up to 30 minutes and to top it all off i now found out my home phone number has be swapped with some random strangers number so i am receiving his calls and he is receiving mine which is known as a crossed line.I have spent no less than 3 hours trying to get through to customer services, which might i add was on my mobile phone at a premium rate due to my home phone crackling and dropping out every now and then, and gotten through once which was to an indian speaking person who could not understand me and barely spoke english so i requested a call back from an english speaking person.I got a phone call back the day after which was brilliant except i was not getting the calls, it was the guy who now had my home phone number. i have emailed utility warehouse telling them of my issue and the only reply i got back was telling me nothing is wrong with my phone line but if i have any further troubles i should ring customer services. needless to say i wont be ringing them and i will be changing my provider!"
1655|I decided to go with this company originally for phone and internet but after spending a bit of time speaking to a nice customer service adviser I ended up taking my gas and electric also with them. I never have any issues with my Internet, I get good speeds also 13Mbps, I also get free calls to 10 international country's for free and free calls 24/7. The gas and electric is a little more than Eon but then again I don't get charged for any standing charges( I am on a key meter on both electric and gas).I now have a contract handset with UW and pay roughly GBP60 a month for everything. They even give me compensation as they couldn't help me with a prank caller when they couldn't change my number for free..I don't have a bad thing to say at the moment with UW, maybe I am lucky from what I have been reading tho.
1656|`i have been a customer now for over 4 years and have all the services from the utility warehouse.Gas,electricity,phone,broadband,mobile phone and their cashback card.Love thats it all on one bill and the cost of all my services.i constantly get stopped when shopping in Marks and Spencer asking me to change to their gas and electricity and every time i tell them i am with The Utility Warehouse the sales person will say we can't  help you.Very happy to recommend for anyone who is thinking of changing to this company.
1657|I have been with utility warehouse about 7 months now and I can honestly say that having worked out my bills over that time I recon I have saved about GBP60 a month plus the cash back card another GBP20-GBP30 a month. The cash back card is a bit of a hassle at first but once you start using it as much as possible then you can see the savings every month.
1658|Any one who is not affiliated with TUW got any feedbackEver company has issues , 2 hour waits on BT , 40 mins wait and usless staff at BG , Talk Talk was like talking to a brick wall any ways I was looking at becoming a distributor with TUW , a friend of mine has been involved with them for several years , I have spoken to various people , some say good things some say they have had problems others say they have had too many I would like to build up an un-biased views and opinions before going forwardit seems that all the 5 star reviews are from distributors pushing the company in to a good light , the others are one star which could quite easily be other company reps , very little in the middle ground which makes it seem very odd.  
1659|There has been a major fault with our phone line and despite them telling us it's being worked on we still have no phone. We have to continually call up asking for updates and keep getting told different dates it will be fixed. You may save money using their products, but beware if there's ever a fault with one because you'll be screwed. They are useless about fixing things or keeping customers informed.  
1660|A friend of mine suggested Utility Warehouse more than 5 years ago & at several points in between reminded me of that. Last year I said OK but if there's one iota of problem then I'll punch you on the nose!Frankly, I'm still kicking myself - I love the utility bills being so clear & online so easily filed. I can keep a check on my meter readings to be in full control. Never had any bother with the change over & the staff have been fantastic when I've called with a query. My bills are lower - the service brilliant - I could've saved myself a fortune plus there's many ways to save even more or even earn some!!!Maggie FisherBirtley
1661|I have been a customer for 4 years now.  We have phone, broadband, gas, electricity and a mobile with the company. We halved our phone on broadband compared to BT, saved about GBP10.00 a month on energy compared to British gas and we earn about GBP25 a month in Cashback which is knocked off of our ill each month.  Brilliant customer service (have only had to ring them twice).   Could not recommend them enough (infant I have recommended them to loads  of friends and utility warehouse knock a percentage off of your bill for every friend you recommend who switches to them - No brainer really!!!) 
1662|The only reason I have awarded 1 start is because this website won't let me score zero.Decide for yourself whether they are any good - Several months into my contract with them and I haven't yet received a bill so I have no idea what I might owe, I have no account number against which to make payments, and they havent provided any details of their bank to whom I could make a payment, and yet they are threatening to cut off my services for not paying. Furthermore, they have lost the form I sent with my private details - I know they received it because they have another form that was enclosed with it, they have told me they will send another form.... I am still waiting.If I contact customer services about this they just tell me I have to pay the bill .... what bill?
1663|Zero Rating or minus 5 stars
1664|I would just like to say that I became a utilitywarehouse customer over 3 years ago and actually had to phone customer services because I thought they weren't billing me correctly I thought my phone and broadband was too cheap and didn't want to end up with a high bill further down the line, but they assured me it was correct. It has been constant all these years and actually went down not so long ago.Approximately 18 months ago a lady at work told me about the business opportunity with UW, I went along to a business meeting, did my due diligence and became a distributor. Now understanding how the company works and the Cashback card I have had GBP1600 in Cashback alone in the last 14 months, that's pretty much free bills for 6 months of the year. I don't know any other company that could do that for me. Not to mention how great it is to be paid month in month out for a job I did once.There is nothing wrong with being a healthy sceptic,which is what I was, but I've never looked back.I love utilitywarehouse.
1665|i had the misfortune of inheriting this company in my new house and they have to be by far the worst company i have ever had the misfortune to encounter...bills always wrong, terrible customer services, never reply to your emails, rude and aggressive..1 week after moving in got a letter asking for GBP100 down payment...as i never heard of them i never did it...then nothing till a week before my November bill...a debt collecting letter for GBP11??? charges on top GBP100...total GBP111...i never had any bill from this company...i then spent 45 mins in a queue on a 0844 number, they finally answered to be greeted by a rude non helpful person who after  a long time explaining the situation finally agreed to remove charges but it was like pulling teeth...however she got the bill wrong which then messed up the following bill...so basically im calling them every month to get the correct bill...to top it all off i only owed them for a weeks worth of gas as my new gas supplier took the account from the on 1/10/12...now they have just taken a big lump...god bless D/D recalls...STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY you will be on the phone every month complaining about your bill...
1666|MY SISTERS BEEN A CUSTOMER FOR OVER 2 YRS, AND I WISH I'D LISTENED TO HER BACK THEN. SAVED ME LOADS OF MONEY ON MY BILLS AND ESP THE CASH BACK CARD.NEVER EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH CUSTOMER SERVICES,THEIR FRIENDLY AND HAPPY AND LUV CHATTING WITH THEM, ALWAYS READY TO HELP OUT IN ANY WAY THEY CAN.BEEN A CUSTOMER FOR 11 MONTHS AND WAS THINKING ABOUT BEING A DISTRIBUTOR FOR THEM 5 MONTHS AGO.AND FINALLY 3 WEEKS AGO BECAME AN ID, FUNNY HOW SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BLIND AND THINK ITS A CON/SCAM. I'VE SIGNED UP MY BEST MATE AND SAVED HER GBP400 A YEAR.JUST LOVE THEM.... 
1667|UW started with a speed incread from yo old ISP to 2MNow 10 moths later its  is a real laggard.The link speed checker still list it as 2M but I have noticed that thw speed, especially vid streming is really slow.I ued to serf the web across 6 tabs now it is really only usable across 2.Too much traffic shaping and bandwidth limiting to be of any use to me any more.I am voting with my feet and taking my business elsware.UW -phew.
1668|I was with scottish power for both my electricity & gas and Virgin Media for my broadband and phone which was so expensive! - I was advised to try utility warehouse, I was sceptical at first as I had never heard of them but I must say I am very glad indeed that I did, the moving process was simple - well apart from scottish power hounding me not to leave but they still couldn't beat the prices that Utility Warehouse had offered and once I had moved everything over I had a problem with the broadband to begin with but it turned out to be a simple issue (My own fault) the customer service and support was excellent! - I really felt like they cared about me as a customer and wanted to resolve my issue.I would suggest Utility Warehouse to anyone considering it, I am extremly glad I did, plus I get money back when I shop at certain stores using their pay as you go credit card.
1669|The service is awful, I have tried calling on 5 occasions to speak to a human to no avail so I tried the email route (4 times) despite a reply saying someone would be in contact within 2 days nothing at all. As soon as I get chance to speak to someone there I am off, the worst service I have ever experienced!
1670|I am saving over GBP58 a month just on my electricity and gas, from a hike by another larger company.  My broadband is much more stable than my previous supplier, I never have to reboot, and I really like the large print, clear fully itemised monthly bill.  I have free calls (10 international destinations) to my family abroad and all landline to landline UK calls are free at any time - Brilliant.  My sim for my iphone is GBP10.00 a month, including data bundle and free budget control gives me peace of mind.  My mother is saving over GBP700 a year .... No other company gives you this level of service either - Which recommended.  I wish I knew about Utility Warehouse a few years ago.  A hint - try to take as many services as possible to maximise savings and the cash back card is a great bonus too.
1671|Me and two of my friends moved into our new student house in August-September 2012 with Utility Warehouse already the supplier. To save the hassle we decided to stay with their company... biggest mistake EVER!The first few payments were cheap and we were happy with the service, but when our bill from December rolled round- WHEN NONE OF US WHERE HARDLY EVEN THERE MAY I ADD!- we received a horrendous, over-expensive bill in the post.The bill came to GBP222 as well as a charge(???) of GBP129 making our December 2013 bill a grand, hellish total of about GBP350... unbelievable! One of my friends went to the landlords and they've said many students have also complained about this company. TAKING ADVANTAGE BY ANY CHANCE?!?!? STUDENTS ARE POOR ENOUGH!Basically, DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY - THEY ARE SNEAKY! The bills will be cheap for the first few months and then it's ridiculous!!!If you're a new customer LEAVE before it's too late and you become a temporary pauper!
1672|Best company, so far no problems And  cash back card is great saving, really  works on money saving so far cash back is paying my Telephone & broadband bill. I was terrified with EDF , my house was empty for 4 months and Edf charged GBP223.23. With my best fighting to find justice and accurate bill it took more than 3 months. And finally I managed to drop my bill to GBP82.67 something.  In my opinion UW is best and helpful for low and medium people. 
1673|Switched over to UW after being a dreadful experience with NPower who mis-sold me at the door. So far, so good. I only get one bill. which is simple and easy to understand I am saving already, especially the mobile and am getting to grips with the Cashback card. The card can be used on the High St (primarily for me Sainsburys, M&S; and Wallis) and online and the Cashback is creditted to my utility bill.I have only had to speak to Customer Services once and they answered the phone very quickly. The girl who was my distributor has dealt with everything else. I am very pleased and would recommend to others.  
1674|Ive had my energy with Utility warehouse for about 4 years, they have been pretty good, my DD was a bit adrift to start with as we installed Gas heating into the house when we moved in and it had been electric before, however after a few readings they got the monthly level spot on and we go into credit in the summer and by the end of winter we are back to level, which is my understanding of how monthly payment is supposed to work.Our home phone and broadband have been with BT forever but I found myself having to ring them every year to negotiate a new price as they would always put a 12 month price in place then it would shoot up when this expired, so  decided to shop around. After much research it was very obvious that UW would be the best option for us, as they give benefits for having it all together, plus it would all be on one bill with one DD. I went onto the website and ordered the broadband and everything went well, until BT decided to bill me for excessive usage form 11 months ago, not just for one month but for 6 of the previous 11! they had apparently made an error in not billing me, very suspicious that this error came to light when I wanted to leave, but anyhow eventually it got sorted out and I ended up with 40GB from UW for much less than the 10GB I was getting from BT.My only negative comment about UW is that their phone line closes at 5pm, this could be improved, but to give them credit when you speak to them they are much better than pretty much any call centre I have ever had to deal with, they go out of their way to answer your question, when we had the billing issues in the beginning they really went further than I expected.I can certainly recommend Utility Warehouse to others based on my experience. 
1675|I have had endless problems with Utility Warehouse Customer Services. Out of a total of seven calls to their Customer Services department to sort out no fewer than three different problems relating to their services, I am still having problems. The first problem related to a faulty router, which they replaced, but insisted I send back the faulty router at my expense. They insisted on it being sent recorded delivery or my account would be charged with the full cost of the replacement. I must point out that I had this router for two months before it went faulty. Thier Customer Service advisors were so condescending and spoke to me as though I was an idiot.The second problem was related to the mobile phone contract I had with them, and ended with me cancelling my contract with them and moving to another supplier.The final straw came when I was invoiced for Club Membership for the account that I had canceled. While thier customer Service advisors are very polite, they had no idea what was happening with the account. I have tried calling them, a waste of valuable time, as you can wait anything from 5 minutes to 55 minutes to speak to anybody. I have complained in writing, and they responded by having a supervisor call me (I am still waiting for him to get back to me with an answer).My advice is to spend a couple of extra pennies for a decent service, and avoid the frustration and aggravation of trying to deal with their Customer Services team.
1676|Avoid this company at all costs.  You would be better off using an oil lamp and a wood stove.  The billing system is almost unreadable which I assume is to their benefit.  I have no idea what I am being charged for or why.  The previous owner of our flat used this company and we inherited it.  I cannot wait to get rid of it.
1677|Where to start they fail on so many issues but I will list some that you need to watch out for.Our mother in law 79 years old lives in a warden assisted complex access is by key code only but she was cold called on by one of the sales team and persuaded to switch her electric supply.A pensioner on her own in a 1 Bed flat on a economy 7 tariif.BIG MISTAKE.The issues1. Two years into the supply they managed to over charge her by GBP612. For her this is more than a years electric!!!When we have complained there responce is the customer is responsible for checking the bills so be warned CHECK your bills.2. They should review payments on a yearly but failed to notice the over payments.3. The bills are far from clear consisting of 6 pages.The economy 7 in this flat has 4 readings day night A & B its a bit complicated.4. Incorrect meter readings recently caused further over charging.5. One meter reading is redundant over the last 3 years its always been read by them a 1 unit but they keep on assuming it is used and estimating a end of month reading which has caused overpayments. 6. After 2.5 years they suddenly started charging for home phone this went on for 6 months till it was spotted the warden cancelled this. They say she signed up for this 3 years ago she says she did not.It was a free call routing service that provides free calls to Utility Wharehouse and club members then they charge GBP7 per month for this made up of GBP3 for the routing GBP4 for min call charge.    7.The complaints department have offered GBP20 compensation for the poor service. 
1678|i got a pay monthly sim card from this company as a gift for my dad and i went to register the sim card they then told me that this account was not registered at all but the c**** took GBP21.00 from my bank account but when i go onto the site where i created my account they wont let me log into my account with the details i provided they said that my account number was not recognised and that i have to register a new account so now i am down GBP21.00 pounds got a sim card thats not even worth a pound and im out of pocket i advise people not to use this company but i do intend to get my money back .
1679|Do not use this company!!! Bill payment is extremely difficult when calling  you get transferred fom pillar to post despite using the phone number that appears on the bill.. I finally moved out of the property where I used their electric service and informed them of such. They are still sending  bills to the property and have charged me GBP60.00 for a visit to the property to disconnect the electric -obviously I wasn't there having told them I moved out in August. I went back to the property today to collect some of the items I had left behind and was greeted by a pile of bills from them. They are now threatning court action for the unpaid bills that are no longer my responsibility. When I phoned to query this I was greeted by the most unhelpful arrogant  person at the other end of the phone!Avoid like the plague!!!!!!!!
1680|"I have gone back to Southern Electric again, even though the tariff is slightly higher than the one UW promised me. ""Promised me"" is the term, because they never kept what they said. I was billed 280 pounds extra for my electricity bill that I managed to get back after threatening them. A one-bedroom flat where no one was living was being rated at 55pounds a month! On the phone, they were very inconsistent and I ended up having to call a million times. The bills were constantly wrong and inconsistent themselves. I do not recommend this supplier at all."
1681|As well as allways one of the lowest tarriffs going.they allways answer calls to them in 15 seconds to a British call centre.
1682|Had a debt with them missed 2 payments but always rang them to make payment, refused my payment and refused to set payment plan back up. Only interested in taking customers to court to enforce payment meter which is 10% more expensive than a normal meter which means more profit for them. No interest in helping customers pay debts back, I even offered 25% of the debt but still refused to set up payment plan.   
1683|My daughter showed me the Utility warehouse about 8 months ago, i was very unsure at first but wanted to help her start her business. I have been pleasantly surprised , saving more than I expected. I found the 'cashback' card har to understand but think I have got it now. You don't get cashback the same as other cards, you get a percent of what you have spent in partner shops deducted from your bill the next month. I am particularly pleased with this part of the service.I have now met some of the friends my daughter has made in the company and they are genuine and kind people. I find it hard to understand the troubles some people are reporting, I have not had any bother.
1684|Delighted to have been informed about this company , which trades as Utility warehouse. Have saved a lot of money on bills, mostly because of having 4 services, t/he best bit is a debitcard like a mastercard. On big shops at Christmas and Summer holidays I then get a percent of what I spent deducted from my bill. It is a really clever way of working, and has made me much better off. I would recommend Utility Warehouse Telecom Plus to everyone I meet. Great company. 
1685|I was with this company just over a year started badley from the start it took two months to sort my internet service they never called to state there was a problem I went with BT in the end....Gas and Electric well started off at supposedly at 79 pounds for each the last bill was 115 pound each not even winter!!! they said well it's the tariff etc etc....trying to get through to these guys is unbelievable I spent best part of 3 hours on the phone hence I cancelled my direct debit once they told me I also have an outstanding balance on top of having paid my bills they can sing for it don't go with these guys they're a con.
1686|"After reading through all the reviews about UW here it's clear that there are NO GENUINE 5* reviews about UW.  Having been to a 'business opportunity' meeting i can see that the  5* postings are repeating the brainwashing blurb from that meeting!! and it's as plain as the nose on your face what's going on.  Anyone with an ounce of sense cant fail to read between the lines of the ""positive"" reviews. They are posted by employees of UW or distributors still working with them.    I came away thinking i might get involved both as a customer/distributor after doing some research of my own.  I have done the research i have looked at the options and decided against it because it simply didnt add up.   I have now seen this review site, and because of this I feel i can't even trust the Which? reviews. It's been said already anyone can post a good review to Which? including the company themselves in an attempt to boost their profile. Steer Clear of UW the savings are not worth the hassle. "
1687|I dont often buy anything these days without scouring the internet for reviews so when i heard about utility warehouse i was understandably dubious beause of the way they operate so i extensively searched the internet to hear what people had to say.Its a bit of a mixed bunch really but it seems that most of the bad reviews are the kind of stuff that can just happen to your phone line sometimes or whatever with any supplier. If you look at some of the reviews of other suppliers on this website you'll see what i mean.  However what pushed me towards the positive was the which? website that i use a lot, i dont think an organisation such as which? would want to risk its reputation by recomending a dodgy company. So I contacted the distributer that gave me his card and booked an appointment.  He was very good and explained everything to me as he provided the quote that was supposed to save me GBP250 a year.....and it did more or less. plus a few extra pounds here and there on the cashback card(i have a sainsburys, argos, boots and wilkinsons in my town).Utility warehouse have been my supplier now for 14 months and i ve never had any bad experiences, the only issue i had was the tarrif i initially was set up on (which is determind by previous suppliers annual estimate) was medium and i wanted to change it to the lower tarrif.  So i contacted my distributer, he came round and explained the differences and we got it changed.I hope this will help anyone that is stuck between the various reviews, just remember to look at the reviews of other suppliers.  They may operate a bit differently but that doesn't mean you cant save a bit of money.
1688|"I signed up with this shower of rubbish when moving into my first home. I joined the budget plan paying set amounts each month these were set up the same as the quotes that we're given online. I thought the quotes where a bit ambitious fir anyone never mind a single person in a 1 bed house who is not there 4 days a week so expected the payment to rise. However shortly after joining I received a letter doubling the price which I though was too much then a week later another letter more than tripling the amount!! All without them recieving any metre readings! I rang them several times to take readings but they said they didn't need them, this is also before my first bill! So they had no idea how much energy I was using and I was fobbed off with 'we base it on the previous occupants consumption (this was a family of 3) totally different to my circumstances. In the end I canceled the direct debit so they could not take over GBP120 for 2 weeks worth of gas and electric! I was quick to receive a call from UW telling me they were wrong and they would cancel the bill and charge me what they had quoted. But then I logged onto my account to find they had put me as over 100 pounds in debt. Calling them going round in circles they finally cancelled this off. Then I checked my online banking for something else and noticed they had taken GBP48.50 in the middle of the month even tho my bill had been paid. I called them and they said it was a mistake, refunded the money and offered GBP20 ""goodwill"" and I changed onto pay for what I use tariff. At the end of the month I logged on to submit my readings as requested and it showed I owed them GBP28.50 yes you guessed they refunded my money but showed me still owing it and all they had done was take my GBP20 ""goodwill"" off the money they should never have taken in the 1st place!!! Fuming and at the end o my teather I rang costing me more money explaining that they should never have taken the money in the first place and I owed them nothing infact I was in credit by 85.30 was painful!! Finally I got this ""debt"" removed which means I never revived my GBP20 goodwill an they are still to get anything right! Peed off is an understatement and yes I want more than GBP20 as there is no good will jut wacking great phone bill having spent hours on the phone to people who dont know their backside from their elbow! Never go near this shower of Rubbish! I am taking my case further as I know I'll win."
1689|I switched my bills to this award winning fantastic company back in March.I couldnt believe that we have all along been paying too much to British gas..Since i ddnt have to sign a contract , i thought i had nothing to lose.Im very happy i did as my bills keep going downn and since i have been refferring family and friends I save alot.I just dont understand those that arent happy. Not any one company is 100% perfect but looking at WHICH reports is one way of kowing that this is by far one of the best companies i know.Keep up the good work team UW.....Im signing up as a distributor today 
1690|"Our land line started  misbehaving.  When it is answered you cannot hear the caller and the caller still hears the ringing tone.  Constantly pressing the call receive and call end buttons eventually gets the call answered.  I did the obvious - turned the'phone off, disconnected broadband etc. etc. and connected the 'phone into the test socket.  I tried a completely new 'phone and tested mine at another address.  The fault remained  so it is not my equipment and must emanate from the socket on....I rang U/W and a very helpful young lady determined after testing that there is a fault.  She offered various appointments and we settled on Saturday morning 0800 to 1300.  Yes, you guessed, no one turned up.  I rang at 1257 and spoke to a young lady called Karmony who was very apologetic and said that Robert Reid from the service department would call me back within 15 minutes.  I asked her to call on the landline rather than my mobile.  Right again.  No call.  I had a missed call on my mobile an hour later, but no message.  I rang U/W at 1525 and was eventually put through to Mr Reid who rather casually told me that apparently the no-show was due to ""lack of resources"".  Open Reach is responsible for the telephone servicing and didn't have an engineer free.  I have been offered an appointment Monday which I asked to be as late as possible (1730) but I was told it can only be between 1300 and 1800.  What happens if they turn up and I haven't got back in time?Anyway, to summarise:I pay U/W for my landline (presently also for mobile, broadband, gas and electricity)They subcontract to Open Reach (over whom they apparently have no influence)I need to report a fault; I make an appointment; I stay in for nothing and then make two 'phone calls to U/W, be kept waiting on the line for a total of 57 minutes, and pay them for the privilege as the calls are chargeable!A bit of communication from either U/W or Open Reach this morning would have saved all this grief.Is it me or am I right to be frustrated at two large communication companies who can't communicate?"
1691|I think I've said it above-no complaints whatsoever-we save GBP500 per year just on the Shopping card!!
1692|I have been a customer with Utility Warehouse for over 3 years now.  I have no complaints at all and quite honestly wonder why anyone would have.  I have my onw personal representative who I can contact at any time.  My bills are substantially lower and everything comes on one bill.  Now I can see exactly where I have spent my money with the cashback card which consistently saves me GBP30-GBP40 off my bill every month.  Very happy customer. Thank you.
1693|An agent from Utility warehouse offered a cheaper tariff on both gas and electric sometime ago but I ended up accumulating unpaid balance on my  bills because I was sold the wrong tariff. 
1694|I am a Utility Warehouse Representative, and a customer. The experience of being a customer has been so poor, and has shown some of the sales information/boasts to be so untrue that there is no way I will promote their services. Their broadband staff are so thin on the ground, desperately under trained and non technical that much of the time, after being on hold up to half an hour, they give disinformation or make you jump through unnecessary hoops while failing to resolve issues. 
1695|"I have been with Utility Warehouse for over a year now, and I cannot fault their service. They have a superb call centre based in London, so any queries are dealt with promptly and courteously. I read my meters at the end of every month, the club website is simple to use and easy to send the meter readings to Head office. (That is more than I can say for EDF energy, the company I moved from!) I pay for the gas and electricity I use, monthly in arrears, so no nasty surprises at the end of the year that used to frequently occur under a budget account with both British gas and EDF. I have recommended Utility Warehouse to a couple of friends, who are both highly delighted with the savings they have made. One of them is an inveterate shopper and states she has saved thousands using the ""Find me the cheapest"" on the club website, possibly a slight exaggeration knowing her.But yes it is a good way to save money. Plus the fact that I get a discount of my bill each month as a thank you from Utility Warehouse for my recommendations. I just do not understand the people that malign this company."
1696|Billing for previous owners, threatening contact and impossible to deal with despite NEVER having set up an account with them. Con men and thieves. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!
1697|They have been charging me for previous tenants from last 3 months, sent couple of emails, and they asked for some documents, sent them requested documents and they refused to take off that debt on our meter, I am trying to find an other supplier, AVOID THEM, they are THIEVES.
1698|I've just moved into my bothers old house, this house has not been lived in for the past 6 months.The previous tenant moved out in November but kept on paying his direct debit to Utility Warehouse so he ended up being in Credit. On giving the final meter reading to them (he also has a photo) they turned round and said that couldn't be possible and then claimed he owed them money, even though he hadn't been living in the property for a few months.I have just moved in to this otherwise empty house and little did anyone know but Utility Warehouse has taken out a Warrant to enter onto the property and fit a card meter. The issue with this is: The house has been empty so no correspondents have made it through to the correct parties involved, The previous tenant owed no money yet they still pursued it because they wasn't convinced with the meter reading (how does that work?) and they are refusing to put the gas meter back as per the home owners request and even threatening to pursue him for the money a grand total of GBP84 including fees.Avoid these jokers they are money grabbing thieves.
1699|I am a small business with two accounts with the Utility Warehouse. They supply our electricity, gas, telephone and broadband. We pay monthly by direct debit. Last march we had our electricity meter changed. For some reason Utility Warehouse would record our meter reading wrong and add zeros to the number. The net effect was exorbitant electricity bills. As we were out of contract I decided to move our account elsewhere as I found a company that was 20% cheaper over all our utility rates. At the same time I queried the meter readings. It seems to me that we had been charged in excess of GBP3,000 too much. As we were changing supply companies I decided to stop the direct debit so Utility Warehouse were unable to take even more of my money and what they overcharged me was in excess of what I owed them. Utility Warehouse stopped my telephone line and would not release us to the new utility company until I reinstated the direct debit. They were uninterested when I explained to them that they in fact would owe me money and I wasn't inclined to give them even more money. They would not budge until my dispute was resolved which they do in their time. I had to make a card payment on account and I am still waiting on their team to resolve the overcharge 3 weeks later. As i depend on the phone for my business I was left with no choice but to to pay. Beware of putting all your utilities with one company. 
1700|I have been with UW for just over a year. I have nothing but praise for them let alone the very low utilities bills. Look, no company is perfect and I have experienced what can only be described as one little hiccup. However, just one free phone call and an extremely helpful member of staff (UK based!)sorted it in no time at all. To have all the bills in one easy to read and understand list is so much better. I am very happy that I am getting a good deal and it so nice not to have the annual hunt online shopping around. Also the cash card gives excellent value and if you use their website you can quickly see where to get good discount. Keep up the good work!
1701|I have ordered a new business phone/broadband line from Utility Warehouse 
1702|Please Please Please avoid Utility Warehouse, I am in financial difficulty and missed a couple of payments as my DD's went out but the bank recalled them without me knowing, therefore when I found out I phoned them and told them on a number of occasions that I would pay the money back monthly which they were happy with. This did not stop them getting a debt collection agency involved and sending me a few letters saying they will take it further if I don't pay straight away, I have gone through this procedure 3 times now, I even told them I am selling my house and will be able to pay them the GBP200 (yes thats all I owe them) I owe them in full very soon. I also found out the other day that if you don't have a Direct Debit set up then you pay 10% more on your bill. Can somebody tell me if they are allowed to threaten me even if I said and I am paying back the money I owe them?
1703|Had an awful experience with them, all I wanted was my utilities sorted for when I moved into my flat. They didn't find it there problem to mention that I had to pay a GBP200 deposit to get anything sorted. When I phoned aswell for two weeks I was told I didn't have to pay, then after living in the flat for 3 weeks with nothing sorted they said I need to pay GBP200 again. Didn't care one but about me. Couldnt trust them after that so I sorted everything out myself. Wish I'd done it sooner, would of been much quicker.
1704|My friend recently became a member of Utility Warehouse and made an appointment with me. She seemed totally changed and gave me a really hard sell, which made me feel uncomfortable. She kept saying how this would change her life and make her rich and if I was her true friend I should sign up. She forgot say that the Gas and Electricity is really expensive with them, you have to pay a members fee and buy a discount card for GBP9.99 which you are charged 35p every time you put money on it or 2% if you pay with a credit card. Also that the card isn't insured so if the company goes bankrupt then you loose your money. This company has changed her and she is moaning and being horrible to her friends when they won't join up. All I say is Utility Warehouse are not nice if they are training people to fleece their friends!
1705|They are a cult not a utility supplier! They just are not competitive when you look at the actual prices charged against deals from other suppliers.UW are always on the look out for ways to make an extra fee from every customer.Their staff are polite, but have no interest at all in helping. Trying to get rid of them is like trying to get rid of a very nasty venereal disease. Every time you think you are in the clear they send another bill!I was a customer for 6 months and they failed to the bill right almost every month. When I went to leave they turned very nasty indeed.Now I manage properties for other people, and it is always a nightmare if a tenant leaves if they were with UW as they will use any excuse to bill the landlord extortionate amounts between tenancies.I would strongly recommend to anyone considering Utility Warehouse to get on the net and look at the figures. They boast they are cheaper than anyone's standard rate - but really who signs up to pay a standard rate? 
1706|I am so fed up and sick of phoning their helpline because my broadband strength is so weak and disconnects  all the time. The time before last I called the helpline I was told my broadband had dropped out over 2,000 times! I just can't stand it any more but I am locked in.
1707|WOW, what a company. Not only are they saving me stacks of my money but they are so friendly. You speak to someone in the U.K who speaks good English. WOW.I also get a person who will help me not some blank person on the other end of a long distance call.And all this just for my energy, unbelievable.Plus with my regular shopping i get even more of my money left in my purse, just from using their cashback card and thanks to their High Street partners, WOW.I am so loving this new way of doing boring domestic bills. 
1708|Utility Warehouse provided telephone and broadband to us. We were supposed to get around 6mb download and frequently were getting around 200kb. After frequent complaints, I decided to change. I cancelled on the 14th July and went to Sky instead. At the point I cancelled, Utility Warehouse stopped the Direct Debit. Despite this, they have sent bills for broadband and phone for July, August, and September. Below is the contents of their latest email. Avoid like the plague!!Thank you for your email. I am sorry to hear that you are not happy with my reply but I regret that I must tell you that our position on this matter has not changed. Based on the facts on your account, we find that we took every effort to resolve this issue for you. Notes on the account show that our technical team tried to contact you on the 15.05.12 and on 16.05.12 as requested to try to fix the issue on the account. We could not reach you and a message was left for you to let you know that you should call us. There is no evidence to show that you contacted us again and on the 15 July we received word that the line was cancelling. In keeping with our terms of agreement with you, the full 30 days notice was applied from this date which is why you are charged until the 14 August. Based on these facts we feel that we were not given sufficient opportunity to resolve your issue before you opted to move away. Even so, in recognition of any failings on our part I have already credited GBP20 to the account. This is fair under the circumstances. Now that we are no longer your provider, we have no way of knowing whether or not this could have been fixed to your satisfaction. Your July and August bill were not paid. (August GBP32.49 and September GBP64.54) The GBP20 I offered has been applied against this sum and the account currently shows that you now owe GBP77.03. It is our belief that we have acted in accordance with the terms of our agreement with you and I am afraid that we will not offer any further refunds to close this issue. I am sure that you intend to further this complaint and whilst this does not make me happy, I accept that you are within your right to do. In keeping with policy, I must advise you that you will have to follow our complaints procedure: https://www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk/files/codes_of_practice/complaints_res.pdf I will leave it to you to decide what you wish to do next. I am sorry that I am not able to offer you the outcome you would prefer and I hope you are able to close this matter soon. If you have any more queries please do not hesitate to contact us on  0844 8157777  or email us at memberservices@uwdc.co.uk.P.S. Help us to improve our service.

1709|"Abysmal company. Moved into a new flat. Previous owner was in debt to UW. Explained previous owner had left. They then trespassed and fit prepayment meters on property, cutting off my gas and electricity with no warning and about a week until a ""prepay"" card arrived.Abysmal customer service. I'm still getting sent mail for previous owner despite spending hours on the phone with them.Still sending me random bills despite the fact that I have no account with them, nor any kind of contract.I have refered them to the regulator.This company is a disgrace. I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy.Also fyi, apparently a lot of the positive reviews on here are from UW salespeople.I will be telling everyone I meet to avoid this awful company.Received *another* letter today asking if I'd like to stay with them.  Not a chance in hell."
1710|"I have just read a number of the reviews are feel that I need to add mine as their experiences do not relect mine. Obviously it is easy to add comments about a company when they are annonymous and with no way of checking. I understand that some authorised distributors may not explain the ""Discount Club"" concept clearly but I believe that if they do then there will be no problems. I joined Utility Warehouse 3 years ago and I have certainly saved money off my bills. The Cashback Card has also been a great investment and the call centre have also been exceptional.I have had one issue during my 3 years membership which did cause me some issues but it was speedily sorted out to a satisfactory conclusion. I have to add that the call centre has been good and my calls have generally been answered in less than a minute. When I was trying to get hold of previous energy suppliers for information about my account (EON and EDF)I was held waiting for a good deal longer (probably averaging closer to 18 minutes) The reason I kept an eye on this was because UW boasted that their call centre answered calls quickly (and they do!) I would highly recommend their services as it has saved me money and my daughter also changed her services on my recommendation and she is more than pleased with the services.There is not one company that will get it right 100% of the time but UW does get a lot right a lot of the time and the services and concept is certainly the best thing I have ever seen."
1711|Customer service is better than I've experienced before. Calls answereed quicker and dealt with far more efficiently. Not always perfect but, as I say, far better than I get elsewhere - from any customer support - beit utilities or anything else. Not some uninformed jobs worth at end of line but someone friendly and knowledgeable.Not the cheapest evr prices but certainly much cheaper than most and I value the convenience of the one bill.
1712|I have been with this company for over 3 years and I have never had one problem with them. They really do beat all the big 6 energy suppliers hands down on gas and electric costs. Te negative views below cannot be taken seriously at all because there is no way that UW is that bad. If they were that bad then Which? would not be recommending them year after year...Its a no brainer to be honest and they don't do credit checks or tie you to contracts. They also don't put you on pre payament meters for 12 months before you can go on normal meters which is unlike the likes of EON  and in some cases NPower and British Gas.The fact that they are honest and upfront is good and they have kept their costs and tarriffs low constantly.They are a hidden gem and worth switching to.
1713|Every company has good and bad reviews. Why would anyone base their choice of utiliy provider on someone elses biased views.Everybody would recommend a company it hasn't had problems with. Yet as soon as they have a problem they condemn that same company.No Utility company is good, but the service is the same in the end, it all comes down the same pipes and wires.So in the end you might as well get the cheapest and if you have no problems that's a bonus.I've used Utility Warehouse for over 9 years now and yes I've had problems, but I also had problems with BT, British Gas, etc., etc. (and they charge more for the privilege)If you sign-up via a good distributor with the Utility Warehouse you'll get personal service, and on that basis I recommend the guy who introduced me.
1714|"Never in my entire life have i come across such a dysfunctional, inept, and circus such as Utility Warehouse.Communication,  standards (terms and conditions) are vague, confusing and balanced to be unhelpful to YOU.any issue regardless of fault ""WILL BE YOUR FAULT"" AND COSTED BACK TO YOU in any form they feel or see fit. if you look or sound weak, they will stalk, hound, bully and use intimidation  to get you to give up the fight with them. they will attempt to use clever words or fake situations ""debt collectors are on route, or court warrants for access to your property have been applied for"" or will quote some regulatory act (Gas/Electric/Phone) to you, telling you of their rights. (remember you have rights too)in summary, the only thing they are lacking is a MASK and GUN!STAY AWAY AND AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!!! "
1715|Before checking out this website i read `WHICH Magazine` for best rated compnaies ,they have over 5 years worth of BEST SUPPLIER .Dealing with the London office is great and fast .[UK BASED] .I now have 1 bill per month for my gas/elec/phone/internet/and mobile ,which means 1 DD per month easy.They have a unique cash back card which allows us to reduce our bills monthly by spending as we normally do at most high street shops where we receive on average 5% rebate off my utility bill monthly ,this reduces the bill by about 20% per month .The price guarantee is simple over a 12 month period they will be the lowest UK price or double difference back .Broadband is excellent and phone service great i receive free calls 24/7 apart from premium lines ,and also free calls to over 12 oversee countries .Mobile service is the lowest cost in the UK AND THE BEST COVERAGE as well being able to change tariffs when i want no penalties .Gas & Electric what can i say works and good cost .1 Bill  //  UK COMPANY // CASH BACK CARD // BEST SERVICE //  
1716|Firstly, I would just like to say that I am normally a sharp tool in the box and very rarely get caught out by bad deals. However, after this experience, I am not quite sure if I am of sound mind anymore!......I shall explain.I was approached by reps from Utility Warehouse (UW) and invited to attend a local seminar  which I did. If anyone has experienced one of their seminars, then you will recognise this! Long term customers standing up and stating how many times they have had the Porsche, and whether they have a Mini; how many customers they have. Everything sounded great  reduced bills, better value for money  all on one monthly bill. Not only that, but if I took out four services I was entitled to more discounts and a cash back card. Being a sceptical and pessimistic person, I remembered those words too good to be true, but I read the paperwork I had, in detail, and could find no reason that this was a bad deal. I was then informed about the Distributor side and how much money I could make selling the service to other unsuspecting customers. Great, I thought, and signed up. I was told that I only need to give around 2 hours per week of my time to get things going, so I saw no reason not to do this around my current lifestyle.Now, this is where things start to go pear shaped......Distributor:Within a week, I received my pack explaining everything I had to do, it was a large pack, with soooo much information, I could not take it all in. I signed up to the online courses and completed them quite quickly and easily. However, more and more letters and paperwork kept coming through the post and I just did not know whether I was coming or going. My Rep tried to contact me several times, but due to my already busy lifestyle I could not find the time to ring back. She gave up ringing in the end! The Cash back card arrives, and reading though, I realise that things are not as they seem. The card works by crediting it from your bank account, and then using it in high street shops instead of cash, thereby generating a saving from the store. Sounds good? Then you find out that for every top up from your account, you are charged GBP1.50. Thats ok, but then you work out that you are not actually saving that much, if anything when used in the shops. I decided there and then to cancel the subscription and forget about becoming a distributor. I send a letter as requested (still in my 3 month period, so I am entitled to a 75% refund of my fee). The letter is lost in the post  how convenient. I have now emailed it to them, which to be honest they have confirmed. Not got my money back, yet though  three weeks, now.Alarm bells start ringing.Customer:Again with the unbelievable amount of paperwork  I think that every extra tree that Andrex plant, (UW) cut down! My phone and broadband transfers over  as I am promised a saving of nearly GBP10 per month for the same service. My Broadband is noticeably slower (56k would be faster), and I now cannot send emails. Apparently I have done something? Oh, that would be the resident fairy, or poltergeist or, well....you get the idea. I am treated like an idiot when I phone them, and (after 10 minutes on hold - not the guaranteed 'answered within 15 seconds') I am asked stupid questions like, is your PC switched on? and is your phone line plugged in?, really basic stuff that my 2yr old son would check!I get a letter telling me my Broadband and Phone is confirmed with (UW), but wait, I then get a bill from my previous provider. I contact them to discover I am still connected and live! Despite being told that I cannot be connected to more than one provide, it appears that I am. UW, after initially very willingly agreeing to contact my previous provider to move over, were now telling me it was my problem to sort? But, am I not the customer? My previous provider (Orange), were very helpful and because of this I decided to move back to Orange. It now appears I cant just switch because UW have changed the format of my line! I now need an engineers appointment and a new phone number to get out of their contract. Not very customer friendly, UW!My first all-in-one bill turned up yesterday..........Deep joy.Gas/Electric for 10 days had been calculated to be GBP68!!!! Eh? Its lovely and warm and I have not even had the heating on for the last three months! My phone and broadband was calculated at only GBP2 less than I had with Orange....but they then added VAT onto it all, giving me a bill of over GBP100 for less than one months service! I have still yet to pay Orange on top of this.What I am finding, is that on the face of it  UW looks incredibly good value. But, when you find that they have forgotten to tell you the details, like plus VAT, and additional extras (that other providers include) cost extra, the costs start mounting and you will actually pay more overall for, what is in my view, a worse service. Even if I want a smart phone  the package deal looks great, but when you start looking into what you get and that things like insurance, handset price, connection etc are all charged on top  its cheaper to search elsewhere.  Oh, on another point, you are offered up to GBP200 to get out of an existing Phone contract. However, what you are not told is that you pay for it, then send disconnection confirmation letter to UW head office, who will then credit your next utility bill. So, why dont I just pay GBP200 towards the bill then, as I am not desperate to spend more money on an inferior contract? I would probably end up with two contracts running anyway, lol!Others may have a very different outlook on UW, but I cant say I have found anything remotely convincing to make me want to continue with the service, and I have now asked for all my services to be moved to different providers.......at a cost of GBP10 for each termination, of course. I have morals, and even if the distributor side was good, I would never be able to sell this complicated, overpriced headache to anyone. Steer well clear, I say! If you see a pink piggy moneybox coming your way, hide!What I have also noticed is that UW are always saying look how many customers we have  now 440,000. I wonder how many have cancelled and gone somewhere else??????? They dont tell you that!You have been warned  enter into one of their extensive, expensive agreements at your own risk!
1717|They make up their own rules ,the salesmen are a waste of time, I hope soon to be free of these so called cheapest utilities around, check them out  properly before signing up with them, they say you can cancel and there is no penalty ,but I am being charged GBP10 cancellation fee ,I didn't like the way I was spoken to when I asked Head Office why they had increased my monthly payments .Dreadful Company Beware ! 
1718|avoid this company at all costs. they have made my life a living hell. they help themselves to your bank account and take out whatever they please. i have asked them for a bill with a full breakdown of costs and they simply refuse. i have never had a single bill off them no emails or anything. just threats of non payment. how do i know whats owed and whats not without any form of proof? i have switched supplier and have waited several weeks for a final bill to arrive but so far have only received threats. the telephone contact number they have doesn't even work and the threats are dated 10 days before they even send them which say you have 7 days from the date of this letter topay up. pay up what exactly? send the proof no problem. until i'm afraid forget it. stay away from them. the staff are very very rude when you do actually get through to them and nothing ever gets resolved. i'm taking it to the ombudsman. its disgusting what they do to people.get your electric and gas elsewhere.
1719|"If someone tells you utility warehouse are good, they're a liar. No matter what you use you will be charged a random amount and even after you tell them you've MOVED HOUSE they will still charge you then refuse to pay you back. I was forced to join as ""part of the tenancy"". Now, OVER THREE YEARS after I moved TWICE, they've sicked a DEBT COLLECTION company on me to collect GBP30 in unpaid bills. THEY OWED ME MONEY HOW CAN I OWE THEM?! I had to spend FOUR HOURS collating bank statements to send them to prove not only had I paid every month they were contesting, they also stole money out of my account after I had left their terrible service. If I really hadn't paid bills why would it take them over 3 years to contact me - after I repeatedly called them trying to get my stolen money back! As everything was on direct debit not only could I have not ""forgotten to pay"" I was fortunate to be covered by the guarantee and get the money back via the bank who were SUPER helpful. I think when the bank demanded the money back from utility warehouse they sicked the debt collectors on to me to ruin my name and credit score out of spite. TERRIBLE EXCUSES FOR HUMAN BEINGS!!"
1720|I am supposed to be a distributor for this so called company, there is no end of things that they dont tell you when you agree to sign up!! I signed up a friend for electricity, the UW said her bill would be GBP50 a month, after being with the UW for a year she ended up with a bill for GBP700 which to say was not expected and unexplained.She has now cancelled her account and I dont blame her. The cash back card has hidden costs that they dont tell you about amongst other things.They have also increased my electric bill by GBP60 amonth we will certainly be going else where. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THESE PEOPLE AND THE COMMISSION YOU GET IS NOT WORTH THE EFFORT!!
1721|This company is absolutely the scum of the earth!!!!!! With the lovely promise of 10% of what you pay over 12 months, finding reasons not to pay it when 12 months is up!! I as many other people have been have been struggling to pay the bills over the last few months and have had to pay in installments with a GBP6 charge every time!! This is the reason I don't get my cash backThis was not mentioned to me when I phoned about my late payments! I am so angry at this company and hope they all get what's coming to them, ie losing their jobs and not being able to afford over expensive gas and electric!!!! Karmabrill get you people!!!!
1722|"I had good broadband service from UW for a couple of years. Moved on to another deal elsewhere, and was efficiently disconnected by UW at my request. Terminal bill included an ""early cancellation"" charge.But there was no early cancellation, so queried, only to be told that all contracts cost GBP10 to terminate, whether in term or not. I sure don't recall being told when I signed up that there would be a charge for leaving even if I worked out a full contract term! Total scam, as far as I can see."
1723|Utility warehouse tried to charge me  GBP100 for not informing them that the property was empty for a month between tenancies ! Despite having final metre readings and start metre readings at the beginning of the new tenancy . Stick with British GAs or Scottish Power , more honest 
1724|Last Jan 2012we made join for home phone and been direct debit in few months ago by no missed payment and but you have to pay GBP2.50 letter with bill or GBP1.50 email for check your account under bill by wqhat you used home phone and the utility warehouse are very lazy to do take our money from our bank and they did cut my line for nothing but our money was sitting down and awaiting for the utility warehouse come and collect our money from our bankBEWARE They are rip off on your money and you have to pay GBP2.50 letter or GBP1.50 for email for nothingBT is not charge for letter with bill are free to save your money than utility warehouse are rip off and I wish they closed down We are not coming back to utility warehouse because rip off and make you have pay reconncet line again for GBP100.00 for nothing but BT are free charge for reconnect line is free
1725|I joined uwdc about 18 months ago and found i kept reciving bills for my gas and ele that would go up by over 50% each month , even through my meter reading had shown that i was useing less than they stated on my bills . when i called them i was passed from dept to dept and was told its normal so at the end of the year it would be less to pay (end of year payment they call it). so i left it for a further 5 months but then i stop`t reciving bills but they were taking money via the bank DD , i called they again they told me , my using had gone up yet i was sending them meter reading that did not match what they were saying on the phone. I then called British gas and asked them to be my new provider of which they they told me it takes 6 weeks after the 6 week period British gas were my new supplier for my ele not gas , I was advised to call utility warehouse . I CALLED THEM THEY TOLD ME THEY UNDER ESTIMATED OVER THE 12 MONTH PERIOD AND I OWED THEM OVER GBP1000.00 , WHEN I ASKED FOR A BRAKE DOWN AND WHY IT COST OVER GBP3500 TO SUPPLY GAS TO A 3 BED HOUSE THEY TOLD ME PAY IT OR WE ARE GOING TO COURT TO PUT A PRE PAYMENT METER IN. I NEVER RECIVED A BRAKE DOWN OR LETTER TO ATTEND COURT , A GAS ENGINEER TURNED UP WITH A BAILIFF AND CHANGED OVER THE METER AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD RECOVER THE GBP1000.00 EXTRA THAT I STILL OWE VIA THE NEW METER , HAVE NOT SEEN DETAILS OF WHY I OWE THIS MONEY AND WHEN I ASK FOR IT I GET TOLD WE WILL SEND IT OUT, STILL WAITING 7 MONTHS LATER.ON THE NEW METER I PUT BETWEEN GBP35.00 TO GBP50.00 AWEEK ON A CARD AND ONLY GET GBP4.50 CREDIT ON THE METER , SO I CALLED THEM AND THEY TOLD ME I NEED TO PUT MORE ON THE METER AS THE CREDIT THAT IS GOING THE METER IS`NT ENOUGH UNLESS I START PAYING VIA THE BANK DD AND THIS WOULD CUT IT DOWN BY OVER 70% BUT UNLESS I DO THIS KEEP PAYING AND SHUT UP.      
1726|Can not stress to people how strongly i would recommend you stay away from these cow boys!!! At first the reduction in my bills seemed an attractive offer but soon realised things were not right when the amount changed every month. I decided to return to my previous and well trusted supplier on early Febuary but transactions have still been taken out of my account!! Apparently even if you canx your Direct Debit when you take out the contract you agree to let them take money willy nilly out of your account...... My bank are now persuing them but even they have told me that this company is not unfamiliar with this company!!STAY AWAY!!!
1727|I Woke to find the internet was not working, I called Utility Warehouse,only to be told that BT had requested my number?? I contacted ofcom a little confused to see if this was possible? Ofcom informed me that when BT requests a number it takes 14 days, and that your provider should inform you of this, which they did not do!!!! With all this information I went back to UW and after dealing with some awful call centre staff, I finally was told, that if I would like to remain with UW, I would have to wait three weeks for re-connection and I would have to pay for the engineer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and just to top it off I couldn't get my phone number back. At no time did they apologize for cutting us off, they kept on putting the blame on BT!  
1728|I became a UWDC member 16 months ago and have never looked back. I signed up for gas, electricity, telephone, broadband, mobile phone and a cashback card. I am not tied in to any contract and am free to leave at any time without penalty.There has never been the slightest problem with any of these utilities, so I just cant understand why some people are being so negative about UWDC.Several people I know personally, are also with UWDC and are always full of praise for the service they recieve.
1729|"I was customer of UW back in 2003 and joined up and persuaded my girlfriend to take on the services. I wish I hadn't!!They were not the cheapest despite claiming to be and when my other half decided to switch she had the devils own job to get away from them. It caused a lot of arguments and I stopped my distributorship with the company.From all the reviews I have read regarding UW there are two types, either absolutely amazing or down right disastrous. It would seem the amazing ones are UW distributorsand the other genuine customers.Also checking out the responses to negative UW reviews that attack the reviewer seem to be from UW distributors who, when don't like what's being said, eventually resort to getting dismissive with, then personally insulting toward the reviewer.If you check any reviews written about any MLM company that are negative they all follow the same pattern. This is a typical response on from MLM distributors caused by an almost blind, cult like unwillingness to accept that the person writing the review is not happy with their experience.Perhaps all of the UW distributors that have responded in this fashion should really be asking themselves, ""is UW doing right by the customers that I sign up? If not why not? IT'S MY REPUTATION THAT'S AT STAKE HERE NOT JUST UW'S"". "
1730|Avoid this company.Inaccurate meter readings.Just recieved an account for GBP922 referred to energy ombudsman.They will not even negotiate.
1731|I can not stress how much you should avoid these people. This company relies on scamming you. They fabricated meter readings for my gas and electric supply several times over the course of the year. The customer service line is always busy and in the event that you do get through to someone, they always pass you from one department to the next. Do yourself a favour and don't trust these people.
1732|Gosh some vitriol spilling here - sounds very much like you prefer to believe bad news. FYI I am saving GBP80 per month so am very happy thank you.  If you don't want to save money then fine - don't - but I am happy to be both a customer and now a distributor - you don't have to like the 'happy clappy' ethos you just need to like the savings and service to be able to recommend it AND FEEL GOOD DOING IT.  And regarding the article in 2009 if that is too far behind for you then perhaps the accolades heaped on the company in the last 2 years will carry more weight -  Shares Magazine 22/4/12 and 21/3/11, WHICH Feb 2012, Sept 2011, Mar 2011, Feb 2011 (will stop there for fear of being told 'old news'),and lastly  Times 24/5/12. The Sunday Times and the Times also did a great write up of the UW in Ways to Save and a case study on Telecom Plus respectively. If you have tried it yourself and have an issue with the amount you save (or don't) then fine write it up. If you don't like being a distributor then stop being one - it didn't cost much to join anyway! But just bitching for the sake of it is a bit sad! 
1733|I have not even received my first bill from Utility Warehouse but I have already cancelled my contract. We had the phone installed in May and it is only been working for about 10 days, 2 faults in less then 2 weeks and one took over 4 days to fix!!. My broadband has never worked!!I have had to call Customer Services over 6 times with calls in excess of 20 mins on a 0844 number. They advertise ASDA being part of their card services, they're not. They stopped in January yet they are still advertising them on their website. They say calls to Australia are free, they're not they are in fact 1p per minute. They say you can cancel your contract whenever you like with no hidden charges, you cant it has cost me GBP48. You cannot get any technical help after 5:30 and none over the weekend?!?! I had 2 service customers literally shout at me today both apologised but I'm sure only because their calls are recorded.I am so sorry I made the switch and would advise any prospective customers not to switch to Utility Warehouse at all costs despite the claims they can save you money, in fact it's probably cost with all the calls I have had to make.S Moodycliffe
1734|I suspect that the moaners and complainers here would have the same problems no matter which company they went with. UW has kept our energy costs down nice and low, and I get GBP30 a month off my bill just by shopping (Sainsbury's, Argos, BnQ etc). My overall bill has NEVER been so small.Customer service is amazing. My internet went slow recently. I called to ask why - within 30 seconds I got a recorded message saying they knew there was a problem at the exchange (every supplier was affected) but they had put on a new phone number for customers calling about anything else because of the high volume of calls.I rang TalkTalk to see what they were doing about it. After waiting 25 minutes for them to answer I gave up.  That's the comparison right there.Over the last weekend there was a minor problem with their cashback card - instead of waiting for customers to call them they emailed EVERYONE to offer a refund if needed. I didn't even realise I needed one until THEY pointed it out. No other company would go this extra mile. The call centre is run by staff who are well trained, and it's LOCAL. And the answer fast.
1735|These people are promising the stars but they are below of the lowest.I have decided to give them my meter reading monthly to avoid unfair bills.Now they own online system never ever accepted the readings stating that according to UW caclulation these readings are incorrect!So every single months I have to write an email with the readings and hope that they will update it on time. Many times this didn't happened so they enforced the calculation bill much higher than my actual usage.The last call today was disgraceful! UW agent telling me that emailing May usage on the 1st of June is too late...he wants me to email him midnight?I hav had enough of this lot and the hussle I have from day 1!These are the worst disorganized dishonest incompetent bunch I have ever came across...AVOIDE THEM AT ALL COST!!The marketer who have hooked me into simply ignored me when problems started..this speaks for itself!
1736|taking them to court. do not trust or use this company AVOID AT ALL COSTS.... have never known a supllier to be so bad and ive been with most utility providers !
1737|My previous flatmates recommended UW and when I moved to a new flat, I lobbied my housemate to sign up with UW about 8 months ago for energy, phone, and internet.That has been a terrible mistake. We have had multiple issues with being billed incorrectly, and most recently, our internet and phone service was cut off this week due to a billing and administrative error made by Utility Warehouse. We received no notice and came home to find the internet and phone cut off and a Final Notice letter threatening legal action, even though we were completely paid up on our account. After speaking to EIGHT different people at UW over the last two days, the best they can promise us is to get the service reconnected in two weeks time. We rely on home internet for work and this experience has been absolutely devastating.The customer service teams have admitted the error was made by Utility Warehouse, but continue to treat us as though we have caused the problem. Very frustrated here. 
1738|This company didn't do another thing that take your money, and charge more and more each month. The service is a mess and even the workers didn't know anything when you call. Actually I never heard about this company before and after I moved houses, the previous tenant was with this company, the first thing they asked me to do, is to pay GBP 100 pounds up front, before I start , and I had too, if not they will suspended the service. Please do go there, you will regret. Horrible company!!!
1739|Awful waste of time and money!Save yourself the stress and enjoy your life.Or you could turn to the dark side and mess up all your utilities inone fell swoop.If its too good to be true then it is.P.S I was foolish enough to be a customer & distributor(the shame!)
1740|utylity warehouse is awful they charge too much they once you have paid they still send you letters to pay for something that they no longer even provide this is just the biggest liars ever!! Avoid them 
1741|I have joined UW 6months ago had a qualified distributor who knew exactly about the services and charges.  If you dont give accurate annual consumptions and guess you will get estimates that you dont like.  Theres no binding in contract and you can walk away when you want and no termination fee.  No Conpany out there offers you double the difference back and 10% back after 12 months so of course your saving. Yes broad band is GBP2.99 for the first 9months and GBP5.99 there after it is clearly written there and also your distributor tells you that,and very fast and that is free when you use your cashback card.  Every company has bad reviews but people still use them so dont be put off by other peoples bad experiences because you dont know the full story.  If your not happy with your bill you can always call your distributor or the UW and they do sort any queries out.  To cut a long story short if your told you can save then try them out for yourself dont be put off by bad reviews thats my experience with every company. I was with e-on and im saving already so im happy thanks to my distributor and UW.
1742|"If you're going to p!ss and moan about something in a review, at least learn to spell what it is you want to say!! I've read (and spent ages trying to understand!) some awful reviews. If you didn't write so horrendously, your ""argument"" may look more credible. It looks like you're just a bunch of low life bums who don't pay their bills on time!! "
1743|I found out about UW through a family member and have never looked back, they proved a really good service, and one that beats all the competition. The best thing i did was switching all four of my services to them, which was fast simple and offers really good savings. Also with there cash back (i brilliant idea) card system it makes it an even better package. I have recommended to all my friends and family and will continue to do so.
1744|What started off to be a what I thought was a good company it turns out that they are unable to caluculate their own account transactions. Everything seemed fine until I moved out of my previous accomdation. UW supplied my Gas and Electricity. 8 months after I left the premises I recieved a bill for over GBP1,500. This I refuse to pay and question its authenticity when they continually calim the wrong meter reading start date, say that I paid less than the figures paid buy DD matching the paper bills I recieved from them. These errors and my attempts to resolve the inaccuracies has spanned over 12 months. They are unaware of the laws and legal practises of the UK as they ignore the fact that you can only be back billed by 12 months.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. It is not worth the time and hassle you will experience at some point in your dealinds.
1745|I had the misfortune to join uw in June/July 2010, a month later realised my mistake and went back to my original provider. Unfortunately uw was still taking money from my account for electicity in December, my mistake for not cancelling the direct debit. On careful inspection of the bill from uw they had the wrong meter number, but with my address on it. I discovered from my suppliers that I was being billed for a house a few doors away!!After being disbelieved I was eventually reimbursed the money they had stolen from my account. But to this day(it happened again today 27/04/12) I still get uw meter readers around to read my meter. I am not going to waste more money calling these charlatans again, lets hope they have to pay the meter readers for calling at my house.I've had to give a rating of 1 star because I couldn't submit my review without. It would have to be a minus.  
1746|"These people are crooks.  They get you to sign up and then do not follow through with their side of things leaving us with one utility our of 4! Once they eventually sorted the rest out they charged GBP100 for a supposed ""rental deposit"" of which I had never heard or seen anything in writing.  I argued my case but they did not seem bothered that I had never received a letter explaining so sent the bailiffs round!  I am now instructing a new supplier and will never use these awful people ever again!"
1747|Hi.  Ok here gos... I signed up with UW last October (2011) after being introduced to the company through a networking event i attended for my own business. I work from home live in a normal house with 3 bedrooms ( no mansion) on a estate and like many people have been ripped off in the past with the various services out there, phone broadband, gas electric etc. I myself was dubious at first, and yes I did think it sounded to good to be true, we started off slowly and got the SIM only deal for GBP9.99 A MONTH for hubby 500 mins and txts, he has never gone over this and are bills HAVE been what they have said, we then took Home phone and broadband no worries at all sooo easy to switch all done in under 7 days and our internet has NEVER given us any problems or any reason to phone UW and they do not pester us perfect !  Finally I got my freephone number for business purposes and my own mobile sim and phone.  We took advantage of the Cashback card as we regulary shop at Sainsburys, Argos and the other thousands of companies that UW work with.  Just gone on line to check our account which is also so simple and you can see what you have immediately.  Our bill for the end of April is GBP120 quid !!  I am so pleased with this as when I was with O2 or even orange for that matter my own bill was 60 quid on its own.  That bill from UW covers Home phone, broadband, freephone number, my phone and hubby's phone, plus with using the cashback card it saved us GBP12 OFF as well and I only shopped as normal. Seriously thought I am sorry for the people on here who have had a bad experience and can only go off what i myself have seen but i can;t rate them highly enough.  And before anyone comments on this and says oh she must be a distibutor I will say YES I AM but do u know what ?? Its personal choice whether you do or don;t take advantage of the rates they can offer and being a distribtor has NOTHING to do with it at all, even if I was not involved with the co I would still have posted this review.  At the end of the day for all the people out there having issues, i would contact the distibutor that signed you up, personally and again this is just me but i always tell friends that decide to do this (and i can;t stress enough its there choice bully boy tatics digust me and that is not the way i work) if they have any issues they can always call me as i think that is how the service should work, if you take the trouble to tell someone re the business at least you should be there for them afterwards. So to finish, this is not a sales pitch and if its come across that way i apologise, however i can only rate them very highly and we are moving the rest of our services over in the next couple of weeks. not being funny but what i am pyaing for gas and electric with another provider (not uw ) is a flamin joke !
1748|The Utility warehouse are looking after a lot of people they are supplying all their utilities on one bill and are so much cheaper than all the big six as they say! not so big now! Big six are panicking. The Utility warehouse have out performed apple this year on the growth rate and strength of there business yes APPLE. Utility Warehouse the most powerfull and best performing debt free company in Europe ! they only opperate within the UK so something is working right.  To be honest I think the utility warehouse will become viral and show the Brittish public that there is a company that do think of us the general public. Rewarding the customer back with the savings they make saving on expensive advertising costs. What a simple concept. The more and more people find out about them,I guarentee that they will be trouble ahead for all communications and energy suppliers.I take my hat off to the management who stuck by the business plan and developed the business when times were hard. If it wasnt for these dedicated folk, Utility Warehouse would not exist and none of us would be taking advantage of this. You have given the public the opportunity to take something back and help them to redirect there spending.My veiws AWESOME
1749|Wow, I've just moved into my new flat, and after only 3 weeks of being here, I've already received a letter from The Utility Warehouse, saying that if I don't pay them the GBP200 deposit I apparently owe them, they will get a court order to break into my house and fit a pre-pay meter, and then charge me GBP720 for the privilege!!!I've never contacted this company and would certainly not get them to supply me with gas and electric, but apparently because the previous tenants were with them, I am now with them.I arranged new services to be supplied the day I moved in, by a different supplier, so to get a letter with such a threat from them is quite a surprise.How they think there's any chance I'll get my services delivered by them with so many awful reviews online, and a letter like the one they sent me, is amazing.I feel sorry for all those 'distributors' going around selling The Utility Warehouse services for them, when the head office behaves like I'm a criminal!Shockingly bad.
1750|They only work 9-5  so you can work out how important is customer service for them.
1751|I thought I had landed on a goldmine after the offered me 500mins and unlimited texts for only 10 pounds a month + the ability to cancel the sim card whenever I like. 3 Months in and every bill I recieve has overcharged me - after 6 months of putting up with their incompetence they threaten to BARR my phone for not paying them back GBP61.00 pounds for a mistake they made. This company not only overcharges individuals it expects them to pay for their mistakes!!! Not only are they incompetent they are reckless!!
1752|Had loads of problems with this company! Missed a couple of paymnts with this company and they took the case the court!said they hand delivered a letter however this was given to a neighbour who had never passed this one!where waiting with a locksmith to break into our house 2weeks before xmas to turn all the electric and gas off so had to be forced to put payment meters in!le the house telling us we couldn't put the gas on as it was too dangerous to use!a 200pound debt turned into 1900!having to put about 70pound on meters each week and when you ring up the don't help you one bit and talk to youy like you are scum!won't let us leave the cpmpany and now we are stuck!lied about everything that was apparently sent to us sent arogant emails stating that they aren't going to do anything for us!absolutel money grabbing cowboys would not recommend to anyone at all!blantent problem with the gas meters and they won't come out and check them!
1753|leave customers waiting on the phone or in general for anything you may require!! prices slowly rise our bills were more in summer than winter. been waiting for them to take my final bill payment from my bank for over two weeks as i dont get my deposit back form the lanlord unitl this happens and they still havent completed the transaction, dont use this company there cowboys 
1754|Had big problems with BT and a neigbour told me to llook at UW. It was easy to do and I'm on course to save GBP600 this year on gas, electricity, phone and broadband. Cheapest broadband at the moment at GBP2.99 per month and I've had no drop outs. Just moving my mobiles across, as its free calls to other mobiles and landline. You save loads more by taking at least 4 services and they seem to be the only provider that let's you bundle energy and telecoms. Good write ups in Which magazine where they appear to have been in the top 3 for the last 5 years at least, so they obviously have a good record.  It all comes on one fully itemised monthly bill and their help centre is based in London.  They couldn't have been more helpful and I could even understand what they said!
1755|I signed up to be a distributor for UWDC and was very excited at the prospect of earning money easily, I thought it was too good to be true, but got assured that it wasn't. I even did a bit of research myself online to make sure it wasn't a scam, but found nothing, so happily paid my introduction fee.After just a few days of joining I was invited to an 'open day' and I wasn't impressed at all. It was like a cult, people cheering and whooping whenever someone came on stage... everyone seemed like they had been brainwashed, it was a very strange atmosphere.I got constant emailed and texts, telling me about upcoming promotions, open days and events. In the end I decided this venture wasn't for me, I didn't have enough time to do it, and altough I like to think I am a very good salesman, it seemed like I was scamming people out of their money and I just didn't like the whole setup. It all seemed very, very strange.To this day I STILL receive emails and texts despite requesting both online and directly with the person with whom I signed up with to be opted out. Very frustrating.Is it good value for money? Is it a good way to earn money? Is it a scam? I don' know. All I would suggest giving it serious thought before signing up as a distributor or customer. They have very clever tactics to rope you in and like any salesman, will say anything to get the sale.I thought I had given it thought but in hindsight, I rushed into it. Don't make the same mistake I did, it will cost you your hard earned money.
1756|I have with the company a little over a year,  I give regular readings and have always been impressed with the service and extra savings that can be made by every day shopping that I would have normally done. There 'which' recommended and personally I can't see why there is so much negativity. I was with British Gas prior to switching and they were an absolute joke who over charged me so much. I got 4 services with utility warehouse and would not switch now. They recommend you give regular meter readings which I do, if you don't and wonder why after a year your plan is out of sync go figure.I would,do recommend this company all day long 
1757|This company is a complete scam for customers and sales reps 'distributors'. As an ex employee i can say that customers are misled because 'distributors' are not adequately trained but also 'distributors' are lied to and are a cash cow for them. You can not trust reviews based on an average of company reviews because a large majority of them are written by sales reps(35,000 distributors)that will be trying to put them in a good light as it will benefit them financially.
1758|Having been a slave to the traditional service providers for many years I was somewhat dubious when a friend of mine approached me about Utility Warehouse. He claimed I could make decent savings on all my household utilitys by switching to them and paying it all on one convenient monthly bill. So I'm ashamed to say it but I was a little mistrusting of his claims, but when he explained there was no minimum term contract and showed me all the awards they had received from Which magazine I decided to give it a go safe in the knowledge that if it wasn't for me or I wasn't making savings then I could leave. Well I transferred my Gas, Electric, home phone and broadband as well as one of my mobiles to them as he had worked it out that by doing so I should make a saving in the region of GBP20 per month or GBP240 per year as well as any extra savings that I could make if I took the Cashback card. HAHA he was wrong in  what I actually saved as it was nearer GBP40 per month and by using the cashback card at there partner stores and online I'll probably have saved nearly GBP800 in my first year as a customer.Dont be fooled by these negative reviews, rather that go with some anonymous poster on a review site listing to the unbiased and totally independent consumer magazine Which.     
1759|Our internet connection was always cutting off with them. We've just moved to TalkTalk and even leaving utility warehouse was made difficult by them!!! Utility wanted to charge us GBP10 just for leaving them... then they want a 30 day notice period that you are leaving (even though there's not term contract!!) Talktalk switched our line after half way through a month but utility warehouse charged us for 30 days from the day we informed them of leaving even though we weren't connected with them!! Then when we thought we had seen the back of utility warehouse they write to us that we have to send back any 'equipment' we had from them!!!!! So i sent back their rubbish 3 year old modem! i hope they enjoy it!Good riddance to bad rubbish!
1760|"I wish I never had signed up with UW. I was told by a friend who was a Distrubtor that I would be saving a lot more money with UW than I would be with Vodafone. I have had problems since day one with them. I have been paying a lot more for my phone bills than I ever did with Vodafone. They are NOT a proper Phone Company because their Customer Service opening times are not 24/7. They finish at 5:30pm every day in the week. So after those times, there is no one to speak to. And Sundays they are closed! It's not what I call Customer Service, they are very poor at it. I would NOT recommend this Company to a friend as they have not helped me with a problem I have with them. I wanted to change my number and requested for a sim card for personal reasons. And I rang up to say I didn't need to use it anymore. Was told by a lady, that I would need to send the sim card back through post, and I would recieve a full refund. Now, I have been told a COMPLETELY different story, that I still would have to pay GBP20.00 charge(for the sim card and number change) for something I have NOT used and the card is still not ACTIVATED!!!!!! I have never known for a Phone company to charge me for something I haven't USED! WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DISGUSTING!They cut your mobile phone line off if you haven't paid a bill. Fair enough, but they don't even tell you through text message, they just do it anyway. And then they bar any calls which are incoming so anyone trying to ring you, can't get through! No notifications are sent when they are about to bar you from all services. They should at least send you an alert on that day when they do it. As that is what other companies do, they notify you. But oh no not Utility Warehouse!I am also, changing my families broadband and gas and electric. I have seen no difference in bills. The broadband is not very good, most of the time I can't even get a good connection, and that is when it at it's peak times.People do NOT sign up with this Company, they are not what they say they are! They charge you more money when they say ""they can get you a better cheaper deal"" "
1761|IF you want the bills to go UP and UP then you've just the Company.IF you want harrassment to bills that you haven't got any involvement.IF you want people knockin on the door at all hours for money that you dont owe.IF you want to settle so that stop harrassing you..IF you want tons of LIE's and still further harrassment..IF you want them , after settling to take you to court.. THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINITE GO WITH THESE GUY.. BAD TO THE CORE..THERE NO EMOTIONAL ...IT JUST ABOUT THE GREEN OF MONEY..!!! .. VERY SAD, VERY HARRASSED , I HAVE AN OTHER MIGRANE COMING ON...IT UTILITY WAREHOUSE
1762|im having problems with the company at the moment! for one since october last year my monthly electric bill is going up GBP20 every month....i ask them to test the meter for a fault but if they dont find one they want to charge me GBP50! also fell behind on a few payments and they sent a debt collector round so far i have been charged for this at the cost of GBP206 even though i made a payment on that day and made a arrangement with them to settle outstanding which they agreed to yesterday has my march bill...strange even though march has only just started...wait for it accordding to them i now owe over GBP600 ???? why somewhere along the line GBP300 has appeared on my bill i nearly hit the floor! i am now being advised by citizens adive to see if they can charge over GBP100 x 2 leagal fees for a bloke to come to my door and try and frighten me! stay well away from this company
1763|IF YOU HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THEM YOU ARE ALMOST CERTAIN TO REGRET IT. MAYBE NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT YOU JUST WAIT. YOU HAVE BEEN FOREWARNED. I am battling with UW at the moment and dont want to ruin my case (as i know their reps are on here spying)so i wont go into details yet but believe me I will be back in a few weeks to talk about my ordeal.What I wanted to say today is please realise that most of the people writing good reviews about Utility warehouse ARE ACTUALLY WORKING FOR UTILITY WAREHOUSE. Do not be fooled. They will comment about other peoples complaints saying things like 'its your responsibility not Utility Warehouse.' What customer do you know that will go in to someones review to discredit another customers experience? This tactic sums up the culture of this business. Their customer services is non-existent. They are rude and unhelpful and the managers are the worst. WATCH THIS SPACE.  
1764|After being a customer for 2years with gas/electric/phone/broadband and now mobile I have to say I am extremely impressed with the value and quality of the customer service this company provides, my bill never exceeds GBP100 for all these services. (I live in a 2bedroom flat in Scotland with me my wife and my little boy) Over Xmas time we did a lot of online shopping on the utility warehouses website and got around GBP60 cash back, putting my bill to around GBP38... incredible value!! I have called the UW customer services only half a dozen times over the last 2 years just to give meter readings and to order my Sim card and found that they are extremely helpful, friendly and it only took around 30sec for them to answer the phone.  Also after reading some of the negative comments on this review site I cant understand people rating this company rubbish. It seems to me that they don't know how to communicate with people on the telephone properly (iv always been precise and direct to the point), are Sh*t at giving meter readings or simply couldn't and wont be pleased with anything anyway. I have also noticed people either giving a 1* OR 5* Never a 3*, 2* OR EVEN 4*.... Frankly i find that rather bizarre... Either Im wrong and talking crap or their is sales people out their playing silly games and ruining a genuinely good company, or as i mention above.         
1765|WOW!! Fantastic savings. After 6 months in i'm starting to see the savings. First few months i dint see much savings and now while using the Cashback card its been amazing. A Happy customer here. 
1766|I hope you could read a formal complaint sent out today by email and hand writing through post. Its the worst energy company I have ever come across:  to their complaint handler called Richard Forbes, I told him how crap that company is.  I have paid GBP106 just gas alone for a 1bedroom flat in less than 21days to enable me have some heat using their pre-payment meter. They took my money on the card given me by  the estate agent into the old tenants debt left on the meter. All I got was GBP30.31 out of the GBP76  topped up with in less than 2weeks of moving into a new address. I work full time from 8:30am-5:30pm and only have my heating on minimum of 4hrs to max 7hrs in a day. Their complaint advisor told me I have used the amount up. I have on more than 2 occasions to get an estimated statement or bill or actual charges in kWh of gas price, none has been provided.I wish those who had 3-5 star reviews could put their big feet in my prickly shoes to see how it feels.Its like trying to crack some rocket science equation to get explaination of their charges in relation to my property. I have paid for utilities in my old 3bedroom house with a husband and 2 step-children with npower using credit meter for gas and prepay meter for electric. I never spent over GBP100 in a month for any of  their energy.  Poor customer service, ripping people off of their money, hidden charges in the service and poor complain handling service by their complaint department. IN SHORT, THE UTILITY WAREHOUSE IS ONE OF THE  SCAM COMPANIES IN 
1767|PLEASE LISTEN TO THE BAD COMMENTS I HAVE SAT ADN READ THEM ADN I AM EXPETRIENCING EXACTLY THE SAME AS ALL YOU POOR PEAOPLE.  IT A NIGHTMATRE COMPANY WITH A SET OF RUDE AND ARROGANT STAFF.  AND YES THE ONES THAT HAVE FOUND THIS COMPANY TO BE THE BEES KNEES YOUR LUCKY, VERY LUCKY.  I HAVE BEEN WITH THE UTILITY WAREHOUSE FOR JUST OVER 1 YEAR AND GUESS WHAT I RECEIVED A WHOPPING BILL YESTERDAY SAYING ALL MY READINGS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATES AND IM IN DEBT BY GBP1000.00 ??? WHAT HOW THE HELL CAN I BE I ASK BUT APPARENTLY I SHOULD WATCH MY CONSUMPTION AND TURN A FEW RADIATORS OFF, I LIVE IN A BUNGALOW FOR GODS SAKE A TWO BEDROOM BUNGALOW.  BUT APPARENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROPERTY DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING, AS IF.  I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH VARIOUS PEOPLE AND OTHER COMPANIES SAID I HAVE BEEN GETTING CHARGED WHAT A SMALL BUSINESS WOULD PAY FOR THEIR ENERGY? HOW CAN THIS BE I ASK?  YOU SPEAK TO THE STAFF AT UTILITY WAREHOUSE ARE SO RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.  PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU REALLY LOOK INTO THIS IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THEN IT OBVIOUSLY IS, AND IVE BEEN ROBBED AND IM READY FOR THE BIG FIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY I CAN AFFORD THIS KIND OF MONEY. BE WARNED  
1768|Am in a real pickle.Moved into my flat on the 26th November.Utlity warehouse were the existing supplier at the time, they never wrote to me about deposits that had to be paid in order to secure a competitive rate. The first I heard from them was a bill at the end of January for a huge sum of money all based on estimated rates. Gave them the true readings but they won't send a new bill, insist that I have to pay the estimated amounts have blocked my attempt to transfer to Atlantic and have now received letters from bailiffs, all of which until last week were sent to 'the occupier' rather than me and have been addressed incorrectly.Do they have the right to demand deposits?I don't know what to do, can anyone tell me where I can get some good advice, a helpline?roginhove@aol.com
1769|We have been energy customers of Utility Warehouse since 2008 and recently changed our home phone and broadband. I can honestly say I find them an absolute joy to deal with especially when I changed my broadband and was helped to set everything up by their UK based call centre, when I got cut off a lovely Scottish guy by the name of Alan called me back on my mobile and did not give up on me until every laptop in the house had been configured! We are a family of four, live in a three bedroom detached house and only pay GBP120 a month for gas, electricity, home phone with free calls and unlimited broadband, I give regular meter readings so I know this is the correct amount. Also, I work from home and I don't scrimp and save with my heating.They don't tie you into any contract or fixed price tariff and I have just been informed that my gas will be reduced from March onwards. If I decided to change my broadband provider tomorrow I would only be charged a GBP10 administration fee even although I only joined them last month. How many of the bigger energy or broadband suppliers offer the same?But the biggest thing for me is that in four years of being with them for energy, I did not receive one sales call about their other services. Unbelievable, I for one will be sticking with them. I have also just signed up my business for cheaper electricity with no contract which means I now benefit from any changes as they occur and I no longer have to remember when my window of change is before the larger companies would roll me over onto a more expensive tariff and tie me in for a minimum of a year and believe me this has happened on more than one occasion!In my opinion you have absolutely nothing to lose by trying out this company as you can leave at any time.
1770|This company came across initially as a great way to save money. What a joke! It took them just a couple of months before my putting my electricity up, and this was something they then continued to do regularly. Also, everytime we gave them a meter reading the bill went up. I live in a tiny little 1 bed flat, I am very concious of keeping lights switched off and only using my heating sparingly and I never leave things on standby. I am at work for 40 hours of the week so no electricity is used during those hours, I don't ever leave the heating on- infact I probably have the heating on for four hours maximum and that's when its very cold weather. My bill is over GBP90.00 a month now, compared to the GBP49.00 it started at and yet my usage has never changed, and yet I am always in credit but they won't reduce my bill! Now I am changing utility company they are making it very difficult for me and have continued to charge me- claiming that my last meter reading showed that I was using even more than the GBP90.00! The credit I had built up was reduced and then paid back to me, and now they want it all back and a lot more! The people on the phone are so rude to customers once you have an account with them- I know it was a different story when I was signing up. STEER CLEAR- AWFUL COMPANY!!!  
1771|please please Dont deal with this company they are a very bad company Please think very hard about this company they are like a company called Amway U W and amway are only a paramid selling YOU BUY PRODUCTS, YOUR SALEPERSON GET COMMISSION FROM YOUR USAGE THEY THEN TRY TO PERSUAYED YOU TO BECOME AN AGENT AND YOU WILL EARN COMMISSION IF YOU GET OTHER PEOPLE ON BOARD IF YOU ARE LUCKY TO DO THIS THEN THEY ARE PERSUEYED TO DO THE SAME THING THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM ALL OF THIS SCAM IS THE PEOPLE ABOVE YOU RIGHT THROUGH TO THE BIG FAT CAT AT THE TOP, THIS IS ONLY A PARAMID COMPANY THEY WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN PEOPLE REALISE THIS FACT
1772|My experience with Utilty Warehouse has been truly awful.Over the past 5 months, they have got 3 bills wrong, and on 1 occasion, even made up a fictitious meter reading - my meter is inside my property, and I was not in on the day they allegedly came to read it!There is never an apology for their errors, and the call centre staff make it seem like it's your fault.I am switching to another supplier, and would not recommend Utility Warehouse to anyone.
1773|My explanation will seem long winded but this is a complicated situation that still hasn't been resolved so I am going to put as many facts as possible on here and update if anything changes.I have also contacted the Ombudsman about this situation and I am awaiting a reply.Let me explain a little about myself and my back story.I have been on medication for depression and mental health issues for quite a few years now. I moved into a new flat in August 2009 and I was with Scottish Power. About 3 months later my Letting Agents asked me if I wanted to move to Utility Warehouse. They said they had been online and found a really cheap electricity supplier.I said yes and signed up for a new contract to be paid by DD. Since I trusted them I didn't think they would steer me wrong.I then had a major reaction to the medication I was on, became suicidal, jumped out of a window and ended up in hospital on 21st December 2009 with a broken back and severe depression. When I was then discharged to my parents house it on the understanding that I was to be there until stable enough to go home. In the meantime the UW switch was going through and start on the 22th January. My mum told the letting agents who said they would set up the UW deal and sort out the Meter reading. When I got my first bill it read like this - Total cost of electricity used (excluding VAT) GBP 0.00Standing charge (GBP) from 22-01-2010 to 31-01-2010 0.96Keeping track of your budget planBefore this month This month TotalCost of electricity you have used GBP 0.00 GBP 0.96 GBP 0.96Your payments GBP 0.00 GBP 32.00 GBP 32.00Credit balance GBP 31.04Your monthly electricity paymentNet budget plan GBP 32.00VAT @ energy rate GBP 1.60Total GBP 33.60Your February billElectricity 32.00Club membership 1.50Subtotal 33.50VAT 1.86Total amount due GBP 35.36We rang UW and explained the situation. They offered to put me on their lowest tariff of GBP5 a month. Considering I wasn't to be home for a while it was a good deal.My dad or brother went to my flat once a week to check on it and retrieve any letters I had. To give you an idea of actual usage here the only thing running was a fridge freezer. When you enter the flat there is an automatic light switch that turns on only while you are in the room. That was it.Every month the bill UW sent said GBP5 and I had no problem with the bills. I always made sure I had money in the bank to pay them. The Next bill I got looked like this - Your March billElectricity 3.11Credits/Debits -31.04Club membership 1.50Subtotal -26.43VAT -1.13Credits used for outstanding balance 32.59Total amount due GBP 5.03The total amount due will be collected by Direct Debit on or after 28-03-2010After that the next lot of bills all looked like this -Estimated Meter reading: 28-02-2010 6189Estimated Meter reading: 31-03-2010 6190Units used 1Kilowatt-hours 1Pence per kilowatt-hour 10.853Total cost of electricity used (excluding VAT) GBP 0.11Standing charge (GBP) from 01-03-2010 to 31-03-2010 3.00Electricity totalsNet GBP 3.11VAT @ energy rate GBP 0.16Total 3.27Electricity 3.11Credits/Debits -31.04Club membership 1.50Subtotal -26.43VAT -1.13Credits used for outstanding balance 32.59Total amount due GBP 5.03The total amount due will be collected by Direct Debit on or after 28-03-2010Fast forward to June 2011. I hadn't been back to the flat to live since I am still unwell. We had a bereavement in the family so made a trip to Portsmouth to see the family.While there I went to the bank to withdraw some money. This is where the problems start.UW had withdrew GBP985.13 from my account without any warning and had made me overdrawn. I was in pieces. Luckily I was with my mum who went into the bank and demand they retrieved the money. Since it had been withdrawn that day the bank was able to get my money back.We shut down the DD immediately and as soon as we got back we rang UW to ask about the money withdrawal and how they came up with such a big amount.They said they had sent out someone to read the meter. This was the first time they had sent someone out to read the meter and bearing in mind I wasn't at the flat it was a bit of a nightmare to cope with. Plus according to the bill it was read in APRIL 2011. The bill for April and May were both for GBP5 and NO mention of the meter being read -Your April billElectricity 3.11Club membership 1.67Subtotal 4.78VAT 0.49Total amount due GBP 5.27The total amount due will be collected by Direct Debit on or after 30-04-2011Your May billElectricity 3.11Club membership 1.67Subtotal 4.78VAT 0.49Total amount due GBP 5.27The total amount due will be collected by Direct Debit on or after 31-05-2011These are the actual readings from the JUNE 2011 bill - Estimated Meter reading: 30-04-2011 6203Meter reader's Meter reading: 26-04-2011 13980Units used 7777Kilowatt-hours 7777Pence per kilowatt-hour 11.276Meter reader's Meter reading: 26-04-2011 13980Estimated Meter reading: 31-05-2011 14480Units used 500Kilowatt-hours 500Pence per kilowatt-hour 11.276Total cost of electricity used (excluding VAT) GBP 933.31Standing charge (GBP) from 01-05-2011 to 31-05-2011 3.00Electricity totalsNet GBP 936.31VAT @ energy rate GBP 46.82Total 983.13Your June billElectricity 936.31Club membership 1.67Subtotal 937.98VAT 47.15Total amount due GBP 985.13The total amount due will be collected by Direct Debit on or after 30-06-2011As you can see it clearly states that the meter reading of 6203 was an estimate. As it had been from the 2nd Bill. I was and still am in shock of the fact that they read the Meter in April and it took them until JUNE to bill me and then for such a HUGE amount. I went to my CAB Mental Health Worker, Mark, who rang them up and spent at least a hour phone call to UW explaining my State of Health and the fact I wasn't anywhere near the flat for all of 2010 and so far all of 2011. We also said the bill was in dispute because to the circumstances and the amount they claimed I owe.We were told they would look into it and then get back to us.Nothing was resolved at all.Mark then Emailed the company and took photocopies of the bills I had.I then received my first bailiff letter from UW. It said I had to contact them about the amount owing. Nothing was resolved at all. They had took no notice of what had been said to them.I returned to Mark and we sat on the Phone again for 45 Minutes this time going over old ground. He said it was unethical for them to send a bailiff's letter to a vunerable adult such as myself.We still have no resolution of this situation.I then got a Meter reading at the beginning of July from my Building Supervisor Andrew. The reading was under the amount shown on the Bill from June. SO I sent it to UW.The August bill came and no sign of them taking note of the reading I had sent -Your August billElectricity 53.73Credits/Debits 6.00Club membership 1.67Subtotal 61.40VAT 3.02Your account is overdueOn the date this bill was produced, there was an outstanding balance on your accountof GBP1049.71.

I don't accept responsibilty for the bill but this was my only option left to me.This had it's own problems. On Friday 20th January Myself and My mum  arranged to meet with someone who would fit a meter. A lady called Joanna arrived. She had actually fitted the Meters at the Flats and knew that it was impossible to fit a new meter without Andrew being there.She said she couldn't fit the meter without access to the Meter Cupboard which could only be granted by Andrew. Since Andrew wasn't available another meter fitting time should be arranged.My mum explained WHY we wanted this doing and Joanna immediately got on the phone to UW. She explained WHY she couldn't fit the meter and told them about the fact that both myself and Andrew had to be there for a Meter fitting. She also had a go at UW for putting me in this position as she herself could see the stress I was under. I am in pieces. I was still no closer to getting this sorted and without the New meter I am dreading the next bill.I have gotten ANOTHER meter reading from Andrew on 23rd January that is 15139. The ESTIMATED reading for December was 15940.That means the reading I got is 802 Points UNDER the estimate. I have informed UW but I won't hold my breathe in getting a result. The Bailiffs letters keep coming even after the Long conversations between Mark and UW. The bills keep piling up too. I am STILL at my parents and I am STILL getting billed extortionate amounts.I have had more than enough of UW to last 10 lifetimes.
1774|I have been with utility warehouse for over 9 months now and have had no problem. I have found the call centre staff to be fine, even if i was on hold a while (which if you are a value member its free).Services are great and i have never had a problem, I think the broadcall package is good and i can't find cheaper anywhere. Gas and Electric are quite good, but at the moment i could save a bit (approx GBP90 a year) by switching, however as i use the cashback card and  club house internet shopping I get a lot of cash back off my bill every month (about GBP44 last month!) which means that i would be far worse off switching in reality. I know the cash back card is not for everyone, but it works well for me and my wife.I do think however, that it is important to give regular meter readings (we do ours monthly) so that no debt is built up. This seems to be the reason for most complaints againt them. And as for the complaints about pricing structure not being clear - its one of the most clear pricing structures i have seen, work out what your usage is then look up in the tables the cost, yes you may have to work out which of the 3 rates (low average and high) will be best for you but its not that hard and you know exactly how much you pay per kw.Overall i am happy with the service, and as long as they remain competative i see no reason to change. They get 4 stars because i think they could be cheaper on the energy side of things, and the waiting for calls to be answered.However it will be interesting to see if, and how quick they respond to the cuts in costs currently being anounced by some of the big 6.
1775|"I moved into my new property which was unfortunately supplied by utility warehouse. The previous occupier had left owing alot of money. I must have phone 4/5 to get my account set up my account with the correct start reads by that time I had already registered to transfer supplier as I was unhappy with the service. The first bill land on my door 2 months after transferring supply for GBP876 for 6 weeks usage. After discussing the error regarding the estimated read which the bill was calculated with I was reassured the next bill would be correct Too my SHOCK I got a new bill for GBP1297 and a debt collections letter billed with higher estimated reads. Was also billed on a deemed tariff which was about 30% more than Scottish power prices because I didn`t set up a payment arrangement with them. Disussed the matter with a manager who stated I didn`t contact them in ""REAL TIME"" when it had taken 4 months for my account to be set by which time I was already supplied by Scottish power !!!! Took 7 months to settle the bill to the correct reads and I`am still received debt collection letter for the previously tenant over a year later. DONT SIGN UP WITH THIS COMPANY !!!!!!!!!"
1776|ABSOLUTE UNPROFFESIONAL COMPANY, AVOID AT ALL COSTS, THEY READ METERS INCORRECTLY AND DEMAND YOU PAY THIER INCORRECT BILLS, THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU TO SORT ANY PROBLEMS OUT THEY WILL OVER CHARGE BECAUSE OF IN CORRECT METER READINGS, A COMPLETE SCAM, AVOID THIS COMPANY OR LEAVE NOW IF YOU ARE WITH THEM BEFORE THEY PLAY THIS LITTLE SCAM ON YOU!
1777|Whilst on maternity they demanded money to pay arrears, this was because we moved house, so they took us off our payment plan due to a new address - without asking I might add!!! I asked them to wait three months so i could go back to work.  When we got GBP60 behind I just needed another 2 weeks to go back to work.  They wouldn't wait even though our normal payments were up to date, just not the extra.  They cut off all our services and threatened to cut off the gas and electric too! WE have three children! When I borrowed GBP200 off my mum and offered them that they wouldn't take it and said it was too late and they wanted the whole GBP729 in one go. We had no mobiles, no home phone and no internet!!!! It does NOT pay to take out all your services with one company. We had been saving money up until it went wrong, but my god when it goes wrong are they aggressive.  Not to mention rude, patronising and unwilling to listen.  They enjoy adding extras fees too.  A very distressing experience all round.  Stupid thing is I'm back at work now, have paid my mum back in full (GBP729) and left them to join british gas.  Wish i'd stay the HELL away from them.  Very upsetting indeed.
1778|"After moving house they were the current suppliers of the property, I wanted to stay with EON so told them EON would be taking over the supply for gas and electricity.Utility Warehouse sent me a bill for a security deposit, I phoned them to once again inform them that I was moving to EON, they told me ""that was fine, i don't have to pay the bill"".The next thing I get is a letter from their debt collection company informing me that a bailiff would be visiting me in the next few days to discuss my account and survey the property for disconnection.A complete joke of a company that seems to have real communication issues!"
1779|Competitive rates, then I got 10% more off for getting broadband and landline with them (which are really great too and only a tenner each). They do a cashback card with which you can get even more money off by shopping. No-brainer for me. I generally save GBP40-50 a month off my bill every month, which pretty covers my gas bill completely.The bill is really clear and easy to read too and I can see exactly how much gas and elec I have used in GBPs which no other company does for some reason (WHY??)I used to be a rate-hopper but I don't think I will be changing again because the cashback card is brilliant and may even mean I get free elec and gas this month with all my Christmas shopping. Lovely.
1780|We wondered why our electricity had gone up from 11p to 11.9p a unit and phoned to enquire. We were told that an increase had taken place and we had been informed. After a lot of searching, we eventually found this information in the small print of the previous bill. Having said that, they are still pretty competitive for electricity.Phonewise, our last bill showed that we were being charged GBP34.99 for Broadcall before any call charges were added, we don't have gas so couldn't get the inclusive daytime calls. Hence we were charged a total of just over GBP50 (plus VAT) for the phone package for GBP14 worth of calls.We have since switched to TalkTalk and are paying (with the yearly advanced line rental) GBP20.25 a month for anytime phone, broadband and 100 mobile minutes and inclusive 0845 and 0870 calls, so less than half UW and we can use the phone much more without paying extra.UWs phone is an LLU service (like TalkTalk) so it will cost you if you want to switch to a provider that requires a BT line
1781|I don't understand why so many people slate this company.  The services are very very good value... and the cashback card is the best service of all.  We often write off 40% of our bill each month which saves us hundreds of pounds a year!I am in the southern region and no one has cheaper energy rates!  People seem to forget the difference between an estimate and paying for what you use... if you think your getting a fantastic deal at GBP30 a month for your gas and electric then your one gullable individual!I moved from Sky to UW for the phone and broadband... same package pretty much, same style filter boxes... same BT lines!  There is absolutely no loss of quality compared to any other provider the only difference being that I get a cheaper bill thanks to the cashback card and recommending friends!I am planning to move my mobile to them too as again great value... reduction from my cashback and they use the Tmobile network which is shared with Orange and has the best coverage in the country!If you do your research like me and ignore the neg ferrets that right these bad reviews because they have to settle their bills you will see that the company is genius and everything has been strategically designed to give great value at low cost!  The only negative is that I don't get my bills for free.... but I am working on it ;)
1782|I recently moved into a property where all the bills were Utility Warehouse and after repeated bad experiences with other energy suppliers, we decided to stay with Utility Warehouse to give them a go.We signed up to receive the telephone, broadband and electric services. We don't have gas and have no need for new mobile phone contracts. So far, we have had one bill a month for all three services which is brilliant and every time I call up to give my meter readings for the electricity, someone picks up after a couple of rings! Very different customer service compared to the other energy suppliers I have been with. I didn't think the energy prices were extremely competitive but we have a Cashback card that we use that takes quite a lot of money off our bills. This, in my opinion, makes it very worthwhile. We're shopping at all of the same places but are saving money doing so. I have also used the 'Find me the cheapest' service a couple of times for Christmas presents and found it easy to use and saved me quite a bit of money too.I have never heard of them before and was a bit cautious as I thought it might be a bit of a con but so far, so good! 
1783|UW are the most rude, unhelpful people i have ever had to deal with. 
1784|UTW is a complete joke and very un professional. After toping up my cashback card for 6 months from my debit card they then changed their rules without consultation. They should be aware that in the UK a contract can be historical and does not have to be written. DO NOT USE UTW, STAY WITH YOUR CURENT SUPPLIER!!
1785|Please think again before signing up to UW.  Since I joined in Aug 11 I have had no end of hassle.(i)  Broadband quality was awful.  I've since moved to another supplier(ii)  Telephone line was awful too.  So much static I couldn't hear.  I've since moved to another supplier(iii)  Wireless router.  I was set one without requesting it.  I'm still trying to get a refund for the rental and return postage(iv)  Gas and Electricity.  Over 2 months in and I am still trying to get the starting readings sorted correctly.  My money has been taken and I'm now told that my Nov bill be sort it.  That remains to be seen.Bottom line is they suck you in and then make it VERY difficult to get things right if they are wrong.  I very much regret using them now.
1786|They are sharks they don't help consumers instead they are in the business to make money for themselves.  i wish i never hear about them I invest in the company luckily I have not gotten any customer for them yet or i would be sorry , try leaving them ....owe them they will take you to court and use their own people to add excess charges .  be ware of them please
1787|I really like UW and have had no problems at all! Basically keep on top of your meter readings and your bills can't be wrong (what you use is what you pay for!) I put my meter reading in every month of 6 weeks and last months bill was -GBP6.23! Im in credit! Although i do have the cashback card which did deduct GBP16 off my bill so the small membership fee of GBP2 per month is well worth it when i look at what im saving anyway!Every company will have negatives and positives. Like i said...stay on top of your usage and you can't go wrong!A very happy customer!
1788|Having read some of these reviews I decided to do some of my own home work.I found out that the Utility Warehouse has been voted top in the Which? magazine for best broadband and phone bundles, the best gas and electricity provider and the best home phone, every year since 2008.They won this for quality of products, customer service, value for money and accuracy of bills.  Added to this they have won the UK stock market awards 2011 for best telecommunications.  They have received good reviews in The Times, The Independent on Sunday and the The Mail on Sunday, the Financial Times March 13 2009 and Daily Mail July 17 2011.  They have also won the UK stock Market Awards 2011 for best Telecommunications PLC and were voted Company of the year 2009 by FT.COM Financial Times.And if I still had any doubts I looked up the FTSE 250.  I think this speaks for its self.

1790|THIS COMPANY ARE COWBOYS. I have now moved to another company this was the problem, i was paying GBP40-GBP50 a month for my electricity so i went to E-on now, i thought that was it i paid my final bill with them and everthing was good till this morning when i got another bill,so i rang them up now they are saying i rang them up to give them a reading when i moved in to the flat i am living in and gave them a reading which was a lower number then the meter reader give them on the same day i moved in GBP45 lower so i spent GBP45 in half a day,i have never had this phone call this company are liars. please keep away!!!!!!!! 
1791|I was an employee for the company and have been selling their products for many years. I have now decided to pack it in, and can tell you the truth about the company, which is complicated. Let me start by stating that all services from the company are legit and they have the right to trade and sell. However, I would compare the company to my local dodgy car dealership. This being that once a customer has come on board, it is all down hill for there. There are many hidden or unexpected charges that could appear randomly anytime after 3 months although usually appear about 6-9 months. The company will do all it can to suck people of its money and one example would be a hidden charge up to GBP1000 if you do not consume enough gas and electric every month. One last thing I will leave you with a piece of advise to not be influenced by the positive reviews that you may come across. I am sure you are aware that many of the positive reviews are falsely written by the employees of the company trying to establish a better name to make an easier sell (yes, I am guilty to many to the lying positive reviews). I would advise anyone to stay clear of the company, however, the choice its up to you. good luck
1792|I was utility warehouse (telecom plus) customer for a year . they charged more then 150GBP a month in summer for a family of 3 for a gas. Don't listen to the agents. The agents will tell you you will get lots of cash back. the cheapest in uk. but not true. They simply get contract from other companies and add etc hidden charges and make you to pay. if you want to become a new customer, you can call them on 0800 number for free. for existing customer its 0844 number and they charge you a lot. Better to run away from this stupid company. They running multi level marketing kind of business to attract more agents to promise them lots of commission to attract many innocent victims. I am really regret that i joined this comany. No one do the same mistake. Thats why i am spending my time writing this online.
1793|I was utility warehouse customer for a year . they charged more then 150GBP a month in summer for a family of 3 for a gas. Don't listen to the agents.

They simply get contract from other companies and add etc hidden charges and make you to pay. if you want to become a new customer, you can call them on 0800 number for free. for existing customer its 0844 number and they charge you a lot.

1794|We have been paying over GBP200 per month for gas and electricity with this company. We are a family of three and live in a two bedroom terrace.It has crippled us and we cant do anything about it for a year untill we have paid the deficit they seem to have invented.Please do NOT sign up with this company. The only people who benefit are the convincing agentsBe warned.
1795|This is clever and simple business Cash back card gets the shops we all use to pay % of what we spend back off our next months bills so i get phone broadband and mobile free! now! well paid for by the shops anyway.Its a discount club on your services which also have no contracts!!!!
1796|I cannot wait to move from this shambolic company they are soooooooo expensive I cannot believe that they are saying I have used in excess GBP500.00 for electricity when nobody is hardly here. They are saying that I should be paying more for electricity and gas. They made an arguement for several months and have stated that I owe them nearly GBP3000 in gas I am at my wits end with this shambolic company they are unhelpful rude obnoxious and quick to put them blame on the customer.Needless to say that I will be moving from them asap and will never recommended them for anything.
1797|I have been using this companies utilities for over a year now and i am very pleased with the services. I would recommend this company to all my friends and family. The customer services is second to none and the value is unbeatable. They have best energy supplier for the 4th year running and the best homephone and broadband...and the cashback card means i dont pay for most of my utilities each month just because im spending money in shops that are partnered with the company. I say, give it a go and take no notice of negative people...look at reviews with other companies before critising this company!!!
1798|I was with Utility Warehouse for 2 years, and although it had beenpretty hassle free until I had left - there still had been some major cock ups! left this year and its been one big hassle - where do i start! first rang with my final meter readings to be told that I was due a credit of GBP274 and to reinstate my direct debit so that they were able to reimburse me however, they ended up actually taking this money from my account which I was able to claim straight back threw my bank (again time spent sorting out their errors)I then received a letter saying that the amount of GBP274 was due and not actually a credit - so again I called to find out exactly how I owed them this much - Turns out the person I had spoke to before had not logged final meter readings correctly - according to this person, again, I was owed a credit but not as much as GBP274. Explained that I wouldnt reinstate direct debit because of error before and I was told a cheque would be posted.One month later.... still no cheque - call again - told that 'sorry we do not owe you a credit, you owe us GBP119' - I told them that there must be an error and asked if I could call back when I had all of my facts in front of me.1 week later receive debt collection letter and I have been disputing this ever since - I emailed over a breakdown of my payments and usage which clearly shows I do not owe them money (may I also add that this email was sent over 2 weeks ago and they have only replied today) anyway they attached a spreadsheet which was meant to show me how it is that I owe them money - however clearly shows that it is still me that is owed a credit - I cant believe that they clearly havent even tried to look into this error for me and just find it acceptable to attach a spreadsheet that actually is in my favour - how thick are the staff!!!!There has been many more calls than mentioned above but I am sure you all get the message.In terms of value for money  - Not that cheap. Myself and my partner, before we moved, lived in a tiny maisonette with economy 7 and considering we were both at work till around 7pm every day - our electric bill wasnt that much different to my friend who lived in a three bedroom house who at the time was on maternity leave.Do not use this company!! however with all that said - Im yet to find any company that correctly bills and offers fantastic customer service.(Just that this company lacks all of the above considerably)
1799|what a load of rubbish, the representatives promise you the earth and the company fails to deliver,(it took two months to get a copy of my contract) from hidden charges eg wireless router GBP2 per month!! wth no other company charges. signing up for all 4 services right in the beginning, being told by customer service dept that you have free calls only to be landed with a huge phone bill because all 4 services have not gone through, two months later still not gone through!, the company has no customer care what so ever the different people in the sales/ customer team tell you different things, there is no consistency in their policies, when i cancelled my account i was told there was a cancellation charge of GBP37 take my money and let me be free from a company who has no idea, DO NOT GO THERE, they are not as cheap as they make out, stick to your original providers at least you know where you stand!
1800|"While I have no significant complaints about the service I received while a customer, it was never straightforward to work out whether I was ""ahead of the game"" in terms of what I was being charged compared to other utility providers and I found contacting UWDC frustrating due to their hours.I believe UWDC base their prices for gas and electricity on an average of standard tariffs of other suppliers and that they admit they are not the cheapest.They do however claim that as a customer you have the opportunity to more than offset this by spending on the casback card - the principle of this is true, but after being charged a monthly GBP1 fee per card for two cards as well as a GBP2 monthly membership fee I had to spend GBP133 per month to earn 3% cashback at Sainsbury's just to cover the monthly charges, before the cashback started compensating for the high utility charges.The UWDC cashback card is a prepaid card - in the past (and from now on) I spend   as much as possible on an Amex Platinum credit card (repaying in full each month) to get cashback and benefit from an interest free period between purchase and payment.  The UWDC card advances your expenditure by making you load up the card in advance - and charging you when you do so.As soon as a year was up, I made the decision to leave UWDC and was surprised to be slapped with a GBP10 disconnection fee for broadband (the Ts & Cs say this charge is applied whenever the service is disconnected).Another issue is that UWDC can only be contacted during office hours on an 0870 number. The selling point is that it is a UK call centre, but personally I'm not bothered where the call centre is as long as I can get through - my preference would be an overseas call centre that is contactable 24 hours a day.  When I phoned up to tell them I was canceling my services, the first person I spoke to was very rude and started making negative comments about other utility providers, which I found to be very unprofessional.  After firmly but politely telling him that my mind was made up and that he could not change my mind, he hung up on me.  I called back and spoke to someone else who accepted my decision with good grace but said that the previous operative hadn't put through my request properly. In summary, I didn't find the service bad (although it was frustrating) but did find the charging structure so complex that I didn't know whether I would have been better off elsewhere.  I'm going to take my chances!   "
1801|I have been unable to access internet since joining this company - have had to phone their technical team every time I wanted to use my computer. Long waits to speak to anyone, hours spent trying to rectify problems - all to no avail. Being charged for a service I havent had .... rude staff .... like trying to speak with the pope getting through to anybody ... am now switching suppliers .... and fighting for a refund .... basically moving to Utility Warehouse was the worst thing I have ever done - steer clear!!!!
1802|"I joined this company last December thro recommendation and was extremely disappointed. I chose 4 services gas,electricity and phone and broadband. There was small bills for three months and then suddenly a 330 pound bill for the electricity. I never got sent any bill so could not check and was then charged 2 pounds for a paper bill. When I queried the erratic bills and complained that I was promised this was the cheapest provider I was told by the customer services I quote:"" you are being unfair as you are comparing our winter charges with a fixed debit by Scottish Power"" what a lot of rubbish. All the customer services were quite abrasive when I dared to question the 330 bill. Absolutely the worst company around if you use it you will definitely loose money compated to others. Should be investigated by regulator as they do not keeep to promises and it is nearly impossible to figure out what they are billing when and where. Avoid at all costs or you will regret !!!"
1803|I have been a customer for over 5 years now and I have my energy, broadband home phone and mobiles with them. All I can say is excellent. The broadband is the best I have had from any supplier, never any loss of signal with the mobiles and even get signal when my friends struggle on vodafone and O2. The bills are fantastic, all on one bill, with one DD. There were no problems when i switched everything happened when they said. I am so impressed that I recommened most of my family who are all now on it, and they love it just as much. The prices as well are very comptetative. Lets be fair all energy companies are not too dissimilar on price but when I use I my cash back card for normal shopping, I save between GBP30 -GBP40 off my bill ever month. The customer service is the best, no call centres abroad. They are here in UK and never had to wait any longer than a few minutes. Apparently they do get busy around billing time but thats expected.What the moaners have to remember is that every company makes mistakes from time to time, and having worked at Npower i know that alot of the time it is the company that you switching from causes the problems and sometimes on purpose. If the company you are moving from blocks the move, gives wrong usages, and won't agree on a meter reading start point then what can UW do. Thye have to start billing you on what your supplier has told them your uasge is.Easy solution...give regular meter readings so they can get your bills right. I sub,it one online every two months, and I have been spot on every month. Give praise for once instead of constant moadning. I bet all the moaners on here have moaned about every compnay they ever have been with, cos people like that pick fault and wish for thisg to moan about. Well all I cxan say is well done Utility Warehouse, full marks from me and my 25 family members who love you. 
1804|I joined Utility Warehouse in April and although I haven't had a final bill from EON yet as the two companys can't agree on a finish and start date UW started billing me anyway, at the end of May I received a bill for over GBP200 I assumed this was for part of April as well because I was told my bill would be the same as before GBP140 per month. Today I received an email letting me know my June bill was ready to view, over GBP200 again!!! Needless to say I have emailed them and shall be phoning tomorrow though I won't hold my breath at speaking to anyone that knows what the hell is going on after reading these emails! I might add that my letting agent advised me to go with these idiots and I am a single mum to a 7 year old in a 2 bed house no tumble dryer, dishwasher, or game stations! Unfortunately for them I will fight this until I get what I want! Dominic Littlewood is like the male version of myself (not in looks!). I am contacting Which magazine whom they use to sell themselves, Trading Standards, Watchdog, and anyone else that will listen! This company should be stopped NOW before they con anyone else. Looks like it's beans on toast everynight this month or until these idiots sort out my bill! Think I'll go back to EON (sometimes the grass isn't greener on the other side)!
1805|Awfull. Disorganised company. Very lengthy waits on the phone when trying to call customer services and then they take no action anyway. Approach with caution and make sure you read the small print.
1806|We went with Utility Warehouse as my house mate met a Sales person for them who told us everything we wanted to hear.  Needless to say we are not happy with service or having a final bill over GBP1054 for Gas and Electric for being with them for 6 months. 2 People could not have used that much electric and Gas plus the GBP100 a month they charged us anyway! altogether that means they are saying in 6 months we have used GBP1645!! After i followed the complaints channel on there website i got a email back which basically said sorry but you have to pay!   Do NOT go with them!!! 
1807|I came across this company, Utility Warehouse, when my father died and he had all his services with them.  Beforehand had never heard of them ........  Not only did I get a sympathetic person when I rang to report his death, but they also advised me on the best way to reduce his costs to a minimum while we were selling his house.  9 months later, the house is still unsold, but the bill is directed to me which I pay every month. Occasionally I have been late as it was only GBP2, and they even suggested leaving it till next month if I liked.  I do always give a meter reading in - so easy to do either online or phoning in, so bills are accurate, but all I can say is I have no complaints at all about their customer service.  Fiona
1808|After reading the many negative reviews about the Utility Warehouse and the many complaints about their Customer Service, I am left wondering if those customers received such a bad service from this company, why did they not follow the complaints procedures available to us all?.   They could have used Consumer Direct the Government-funded advice service offering information and advice on all consumer issues including energy.   Consumer Direct can give specific advice about resolving energy enquiries and complaints. Consumer Direct records details of the types of contacts it receives for use by Ofgem, Consumer Focus Trading Standards and other bodies.   You can call Consumer Direct on 08454 04 05 06 or contact them via their online complaint and enquiry service via Direct.gov's website.  If you have a complaint or enquiry relating to an energy supplier or network operator, you should contact that company directly in the first instance.   All energy suppliers and electricity and gas network operators are required through strict complaints handling standards to deal proactively with complaints and enquiries from domestic customers and micro-businesses.   The Energy Ombudsman can investigate complaints for domestic and micro-business consumers that the energy supplier or network operator cannot resolve. They can normally deal with a complaint if it has been with the energy company for 8 weeks or if the company has declared the complaint deadlocked (i.e. they have said they can do no more) whichever is the earlier.   The Energy Ombudsman can ask your supplier or network operator to apologise and can take practical action to resolve a complaint and, in some cases, make a financial award.   Surley if the Utility Warehouse Customer and billing Service is that bad, using the comsumer protection services would force them to improve things or face loosing future customers. 
1809|"WARNING!!! STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!  I've read some of the positive reviews and I have to say that they sound very much like employees from Utility Warehouse! UW is completely unreasonable to deal with, they charge a fortune, they are not forthcoming, they are extremely unprofessional to deal with, they will mess you around big style, etc etc etc  We purchased an apartment last year and upon moving in we immediately contacted our preferred suppliers to switch.  Several weeks later we found out that our preferred suppliers were refused the right to take over accounts by UW as there was an outstanding debt on the apartment we purchased.  This took months and Utility Warehouse never contacted us!!!  UW then sent around the debt collectors which was then the first time we knew something was wrong!  Luckily Security refused entry and escorted them off the premised HOWEVER it caused unnecessary aggravation and a huge embarrassment for us.  We immediately acted and contacted UW and got to the bottom of this mess.  The previous occupier did not pay their bill and we basically informed them that the previous owner is no longer at this address.  However we also told them to release the accounts to our preferred suppliers to which UW informed us that we had to pay for the period we were at this property. Fair enough.  We clearly want pay for everything unit we have rightfully consumed and the said is not the issue.  So we paid without checking their invoice (stupid us and big mistake!!!).  Several weeks passed and we received a final warning letter.  Again we contacted UW and they claimed that some of the readings were incorrect (they basically messed up) and asked us to pay AGAIN.  I was extremely annoyed by this unprofessional behaviour and the fact that we had to pay for their mistake made our blood boil.  This is when we looked into their invoice in detail and we queried everything including the readings.  Although the reading were correct and as per the meter reader they appear to have charged a fortune per unit!!!  I have demanded to know the costs per unit prior having moved in and their written response was that the energy tariff rates before and after we moved in were not relevant to our enquiry.   Furthermore they then confirmed that they charge what they call ""deemed contract rates"" (basically they charge you the most highest possible rates during the transition period!!!).  I pointed out that these rates were extremely unreasonable in particular when it was not our fault and that UW was sitting on the accounts in the first place and did not release the said to our preferred suppliers as such the costs incremented.  I believe that such was done on purpose to charge an absolutely fortune.  We basically were forced to pay the same for a 3 month period which we would normally consume and pay in a year!!!  Since we got clearly messed around with I asked from a fairness perspective that UW would charge us a fair and market oriented rate.  Their response was ""As an owner/occupier who has not signed a standard contract with us you must pay us for all the energy you use based on the Deemed contract rates, unless or until you switch suppliers. This is a legally binding contract."" Furthermore they stated in an email ""I am afraid that I will not be able to agree with your proposals on this occasion.""  They then went on to say ""If we do not receive contact or payment as per the above within 14 days, I will make arrangements for the outstanding balance to be passed to a debt collection agency"".  I recommend for anyone who is reading this not to do any business whatsoever with Utility Warehouse.  Stay well away from them as in the end they WILL find a way to rip you off! "
1810|I've been a customer for around 18 months and not had any problems. I think the problem with us Brits is we like to complain and when things go well, we say nothing. a lot of the above problems seem to relate to direct debits and that can be a problem with whatever service you sign up to when dealing with DD. All i can suggest to anyone thinking of joining the utility warehouse is to look at some independent reviews before judging the whole company on a few unhappy customers. here's what made me decide they were a trustworthy and great value for money company.       Which? February 2010 - Best Buy Home Phone & Broadband  Which? February 2011 - Recommended Provider for Energy  Which? February 2011 - Recommended Provider for Home Phone  Which? March 2011 - Recommended Provider for broadband  Which? Money March 2010 - Top Bundler 
1811|Stay away from  this company. They will charge your debit card without your knowledge. I called them to query why they had taken the payment, and they kept transferring my call. This also cost me a lot of money because it was an 0845 number.
1812|No energy company is perfect, but Utility Warehouse is certainly the best value.  I get GBP15-20 off my bill every month with my cashback card and I have never had any problems with internet speed or my phone line.    The only way to ensure accurate bills from any utility company is to supply regular meter readings and Utility Warehouse are no different.  Give the readings and the bills are accurate.  The only downside is that to get the biggest discount you have to take out more services.  Having them all on the same bill is a great aid to budgeting though and the internet/phone/mobile are about the best value out there.
1813|I signed up with this company some years ago and, when I fell upon hard times, I contacted them to cancel our arrangement for telephone line and broadband.  I informed them that I'd had to stop the direct debit, and asked for a little time to pay, suggesting we would work out a repayment plan for what was owing. The only letters I ever received from them were demands for payment, and further bills for the service, no longer provided, which I'd asked to be terminated. Worse was to come....at some point when setting up the account I had paid them with my debit card.  One day, without my knowledge, completely out of the blue they simply charged the card for some of the debt.  I needn't go on, the hardship was mine to bear, but needless to say I would never have anything further to do with such a company.
1814|I used Utility Warehouse as my energy supplier for one month before my previous supplier phoned and undercut their price. The main issue I have is that they take your account details when you sign up- even though I cancelled my direct debit they are STILL taking money out of my account. I never received a final statement and was assured over the phone that I owe them no money. I looked at my previous statements and they have been sifling inconsistent amounts since January-I ceased custom with them in early December. The disgrace of this is that they are literally 'stealing' money from my account.  
1815|"I like the fact that everything is on one bill. I took broadband, phone, gas & electric. I was told I'd get GBP100 discount after a year for 4 services and it would compensate for having to connect the phone (rented house & was on Virgin). I didn't even mind the absurdly high bills from the ""discount scheme"" such that I had to ask for GBP460 back on the gas & electic after just one year.   BUT I wasn't told that I had to give meter readings every quarter to get the GBP100. I missed one reading, which was due to me having the reading but the site being down and then life got in the way. At the end of the year I asked where the discount was. They said it is in the small print. They were not impolite on the phone or by email but did not respond to the detail in my letter (which they only acknowledged when I sent emails in support). I will switch as soon as I can be bothered - they may yet defeat me! "
1816|I am really disgusted with them. Now I have used more than 15 hours on them, and I don't seem to go anywhere.  They are very expensive and the service is bad.  The truth is I have saved 500 Pr .year buying my energy from another provider. They overpriced me and when tried to leave them they got angry and threaten me to cut my gas and el connection. Also when paid them by direct debit, they took much more than I permit them.   Don't make the same mistake as me. If you see the comparison websites, you will see that they are expensive and unreasonable both in prices and customer service. The only reason I got involved with them is: they were supplying a rented property I have moved in.  
1817|I love having all my services on one bill, the cash back card is great I generally get GBP25 pound off my bill so I pay basically get internet phone all my calls free and GBP5 of my energy which is already cheap (; would love them to do TV and have all saints as a cash back partner!
1818|be warned this company is a nightmare. had meters fitted in 2009 to clear arrears off GBP1500 by GBP20 aweek. money has been deducted every week since then, but am now owing more that i owed b4. phoned them somany times and cant seem to get anywere with them.they have now put my payment up to GBP50 aweek and i cant afford to pay them any more money.any advise on what to do next
1819|The Utility Warehouse are without question the best company I have ever used for my utilities, I no longer have the hassle of going through five different bills each month and spending goodness knows how long being placed on hold or sent through to india or south africa when I cant understand a word they are saying just to query my bill as I had previously experienced with British gas and Bt!!! As the british just doesnt seem to be there anymore.  Utility warehouse have a call centre here in london my bills are significantly cheaper and I am no longer tied into long contracts, I am so impressed with the company my wife and I are seriously considering joining  as part time distributors, enough said!!
1820|I have been with utility warehouse now for 2 years in my first year i saved over GBP1k on all my services . i took broadband, calls, gas & electric. I was made redundant and needed to reduce my bills as I was paying way too much. I am so pleased with how the company have dealt with my order. I can call a British call center for my queries should i have any. My calls are usually answered within around 15-20 seconds.I love the One Bill for all my services and the One Direct debit at the end of every month.The beauty of being with UW is that I can also save money on my shopping, food, petrol and lots lots more. Since they bought out a cashback card I save an average 25-30% of my bill every month by shopping...In total this year alone I have saved over GBP200 on shopping. That is a vast amount of money when you dont have any spare. its going towards a holiday and if I book online with UW i can save even more money...This card is brilliant. In fact the company are brilliant. Thank You UW for saving me money... And all those who are sceptical...THE WHICH MAG give them best ratings for ALL there products and services. Also Financial times haves named them Company of The Year..Do you need to read those other reviews that slate this company? All companies NEVER get 100%
1821|this company is just awfull, have had nothing but trouble, when you contact them they just fob you off, have had thing wrongly charged to my account, when ive tried to complain they dont do anything about it, couldnt cancel my account fast enough,
1822|When I've read these reviews, both good and bad, I can't help but feel that the negative ones seem to wish to blame everyone else but themselves for the problems they've experienced.  We've been with Utility Warehouse and have nothing but the highest praise for them.  They claim that 90% of calls are answered in 15 seconds, in the UK, AND THEY ARE.  The service we've received when we've called has been impeccable and certainly no one has ever been rude to us.  When you take the cash back card, the free calls we get, the discount plan for recommending other customers and now I think online cash back too, there is nothing to touch the pricing either.    Last week a girl from NPower stoped me and asked me who we were with, and when I said Utility Warehouse she told me not to switch if I had the whole package as no one could beat them!!!!!!  So, I just think in common with so many people nowadays, you have to take responsibility for your own actions (like not paying a bill!!!) and grow up!!
1823|"Where to start...I WAS a distributor and a customer for UW and so can give a complete picture. First as a distributor; there is so much small print to being a distributor. I paid GBP199 to join the company on the understanding that after gathering 12 customers I would get double my money back (GBP399) what they fail to mention (and expect you to read the business manual cover to cover and know it off by heart is that the 12 qualifying customers have to take a phone line. so 28 customers later I was told oh no only 8 customers have phone service so you get nothing, I was then left with about 2 weeks to desperately find 4 customers who could take a telephone service. with a couple days to go I did it! but surprise surprise there was another bit of small print. one of my customers took a mobile but there was a form I had to fill out to get the number transferred. This had NEVER been mentioned to me, again I was just told ""it's in the business manual"" surely this is quite important and should be mentioned in the training. consequently my last customers line went live 4 days after the cut off (3 months) would they give me my bonus....would they b*llocks!  This really shocked me and I lost my confidence in the company and in selling it. But I thought I could give it a couple months and start again forgetting how they have mugged me off. At this point I was earning about GBP60 a month commission. This in its self is lower than it should be but that was because ""distributors only get paid commission on telephony services but if a customer just has gas and electric, you get nothing"" Then 3 months later has I had not gathered a new customer for 6 months my commission dropped from GBP60 a month to GBP2 a month. I was then told I only get the full (by full they mean the GBP60 not the GBP120 that it should be) I had to gather a new customer each month. Again I was referred to the business manual.... so I then sat and read through the manual, as it seemed SO important. I finally got myself straight with things (although I didn't like it, I thought I could make it work) so I started to think about new customers I could gather. I thought New Year new start and planned to start gathering again. It was a mere week later that I was told I now I had been a distributor for 12 months I now have to pay GBP4 a month to continue. Now bearing in mind I'm only GBP2 a month it essentially means I will be paying UW GBP2 for the privilege of being a distributor. It was at this point I said enough is enough and decided to stop being a distributor. So as a UW customer; there is so much they have done that if I listed it all you would still be reading a year later, so I thought I would just use the most recent example. I pay my bills via direct debit and for some reason (don't know if it was a problem with UW or my bank) my DD got cancelled.  My Jan bill was due to come out on the 1/02/2011. Now I don't check my bank regularly everything comes out and that's it, but unbeknown to me this DD did not come out, I DID NOT receive any communication that I had an outstanding balance. I even got my Feb bill which should NO outstanding balance (it normally puts it on the front page if you have) so I had no reason to suspect anything. No phone calls and no letters from them to say anything. I then went to use my phone on the 25/02/2011 and it was not working. I then used my mobile (to ring there chargeable number) and was on hold for 20 minutes. My call finally went through and I could hear office noise but no one was there to answer my call. Now having waited 20 minutes to get through I wasn't going to hang up. (I assumed someone had left there headset on the desk and gone for a break) I then continued to whistle and shout down the phone (hoping someone would hear me for about 25-30 minutes. It was at this point I eventually gave up and hung up and called back, another 25 minutes later finally I got through, but I couldn't believe my luck when I had got through to the same desk (I assume) as again there was no one there. In the end I gave up and hung up. I then called again later that evening and finally spoke to someone who advised my phone wasn't working because of an outstanding balance. I asked the person to wait whilst I check online banking, and it was only at that point I realised that it hadn't been paid (this was the first I know about it) I then immediately paid the balance, and was told my phone would be back on in 24hrs. 72hrs later still no phone and so I called back and was told that because my next bill was due today (despite my DD set up for the 1/03/11) they couldn't switch me back on because the bill is technically late until the DD comes out tomorrow. So essentially they were saying because I haven't paid they can't switch it back on. Despite it not actually being due! I then was fuming and left it for a couple days; I then checked the bank and surprise surprise the DD had not gone through AGAIN. I then rung up today and paid the balance and asked when my phone would be put back on. To which I was told (by the rudest guy Caesar who just talked over me) that my phone line had been ceased and if I wanted it re-connected I needed to pay GBP99. When I questioned this he said that once your bill is 7 days late they bar your phone(meaning you can't make outgoing calls) then after 14 days they beginning the cease of the line. 14 DAYS!!! It doesn't give much room for error. I then asked whether they feel I should pay this as clearly there is a problem and they failed to communicate this to me. To which he replied ""of course you have to pay you have no room for argument"". Now unbeknown to UW we have moved all our services to SKY and British GAS apart from the phone (SKY said they can't do as UW won't release the line) so essentially I have to pay UW GBP99 to switch my line back on so I can then switch to another supplier. In my opinion it's fair to bar someone's line if they don't pay, but to cut them off (incurring a GBP99 charge) shouldn't be taken to slightly, especially as I'm convinced they have something to do with the DD failing. A letter or a phone wouldn't have gone a miss As a final straw they then said I had GBP1.50 of call charges to pay (even though my line had been disconnected) because every time we have tried to make a call and it didn't go through it automatically dials through to them incurring a 10-12p charge. Now obviously I was consistently trying my line to see it was working and so have quite a few of these. Although some of them were at 5am, when I was quietly tucked up in bed, so they have defiantly added a few extras on there, would they admit this was wrong.....NO! As a final thought if anyone asked me whether they should join the UW as a customer or a distributor I would make it my life mission to ensure they didn't waste a single penny...YES UW are cheaper, but it's because they have so many hidden charges/fees that actually they are probably more expensive overall. I'm pretty sure BT would cease my line if I paid 14 days late! Anyway I know it's a bit long but I just thought I would explain the overall picture Amy Ex-distributor Ex- customer  "
1824|I am disgusted with them, every time i speak to them they are rude, they over charge my electric, i have never received a bill in 12 momths and when i ask them for my bills they are nasty and say that i have my bills, i asked for updates on my account i received one letter without the information i request, and still no bills, when ever i ask another supplier they refuse me, i am so angry, i wish i never joined then in the begining. I have to click a star to post this but i DONT rated them, and they are not vfm. 
1825|what an outfit. I was GBP500 in credit and they kept tellimg me they would sort it. Had to get my bank to claw back 4 d/d payments which they did in minutes. GBP450 in my account in minutes!!! Then they said they owed me another GBP299? But put a stop on me moving suppliers because i owed them money. Then they told me it would cost me GBP6 to send a cheque or transfer what they owed me. The whole system is a disgrace.I can handle these people who promise to sort things but don't, and block you moving suppliers because of their incompetance. BUT who do you turn to for help....especialy if you are elderly.  
1826|Really surprised at some of the reviews on here about Utility Warehouse, I've been a customer for 5yrs and have Electric and phone, I'm in the process of moving home and will be taking broadband and cashback card too when I move. The only problem I've ever had was that my origional energy quote was too low so I was paying way under what I should of on my payment plan but now I'm paying what I should and give regular readings despite this I saved loads after switching from my regional supplier. I recommended to my mother inlaw and the only prob she had was a previous tennants debt was still on her pre pay meter and she put GBP50 in it her 1st week but after ringing customer services it was all sorted!
1827|I can't believe all the negative comments I have heard about this Company.  I have been with them for over 3 years.  The cashback card has changed my life.  I now look forward to receiving my bill to see how much money I have saved rather than thinking about how much I have to pay.  When I needed to change mobile tariff I had to change at the end of a month so they gave me and extra GBP10 credit to see me through.  Would definately recommend them.
1828|I can't believe how rude and agressive this company's customer 'service' people are.  I've never been spoken to so poorly, and I certainly would not advise a friend to join this cowboy outfit.  Beware!
1829|Tried to contact  TUW to join. On their web site. they wanted credit card and DD details before they would proceed.  Tried to contact them by phone but kept getting directed to agents sites and domestic phone numbers.  Got a a real feeling they are not a solid and secure company so looked for reviews.  DONT think ill go there.  As already stated, looks like the good reviews are from agents. 
1830|The broadband service is fantastic. I used to be with Zen and I have recently switched to the UW broadband and telephone services. Zen's broadband was slow ALL the time.  I don't leave far from the exchange and I can easily get 10mb with the UW whereas I could not get more than 5 with Zen. People complaining about their broadband must be the ones who leave far from the exchange. UW customer's services are great, your calls get answered quickly, and they are friendly and helpful.  Overall I am happy that I have switched. So far so good 
1831|"Based on the current reviews below I'm certainly surprised. Most of the unhappy chaps have all moved into rentable properties after a previous occupant that hasn't paid there last bills, therefore getting the full brunt of outstanding balances on there newly rented/bought property's. im sure every service provider has its good and bad areas and customers .In future do some homework before moving in. Utility warehouse is a fab service provider and a great way of saving money from the larger companys that rip you off. I'm sure there customer service- English"" would sort out the matter. Any service provider would be unruley to anyone not paying your way. I don't use utility's for everything and I'm not a worker, but my parents do use the services. I have sky and thats because of the tv package.but if they took on tv I would change.plus no contracts .But I use a utility card and mobile phone service. If your thinking of joining . Go for it. Recommend and you could see your bills eventually become credit."
1832|UW of my what a joke and complete waste of time and will lose you money to boot. Inherited them in retirement flat, Iam 72 and tried to change electricity and phone for 3 months. In the end I had to get my son to threaten legal action (he is solicitor) and change my Bank Account. They gave me GBP10 for my trouble after referring to a non existing debt (GBP187) to a debt collecting firm and registered a default. My son is try after 8 months to get it off my credit record. I have never not paid any money in 72 years. If you buy a property or rent never accept till UW is removed a sa supplier.
1833|Wow I'm shocked! I was looking to see how everyone rates the club house card and was amazed to see how many people have had such problems with Utility Warehouse. I've been a customer for about eight years now and have gas, electric, home phone and mobile with them. Compared to my friend who lives in same type of property with one less child I pay way less than her. Never had any problems at all.....very happy to recommend!
1834|terrible communicators and have to wait an absolute age to get through on the phone(currently trying to have a new line installed). I wish  I had never heard of them. Also have conspired with Openreach to charge me GBP130 for a visit from an incompetent engineer
1835|THE worst company I have ever experienced.  We also inherited Utility Warehouse when we moved to a rental property. GBP500 for 6 weeks gas and electric!!  After speaking to 3 different advisors who contradicted one another, being lied to and having one advisor get angry and argue with me when I am never anything but polite, I've decided I really have had enough of this sad excuse of a company.  How on earth are they allowed to operate with this appalling attitude to customers and distinct lack of respect. There is plenty more I could go into but I think I've said enough.  **STAY AWAY FROM THE UTILITY WAREHOUSE**
1836|I bought a repossessed home last August where I inherited Utilities Warehouse as the default supplier.  I immediately requested to change them as there were better deals available from other companies.  After they blocked my transfer several times they then tried to issue me with bills of GBP800 from the previous occupiers eventhough I had sent them across details of proof of purchase which they approved.  I was forced to set up a new account with them where they have been trying to bill me for GBP600 even though I have only used circa GBP10 of gas/electric in the time they were the supplier.  I have been threatened with legal action, bailiffs and a court summons and all for their incorrect billing.  I will be making a formal complaint as this is harrassment.  Their Energy Team are the most unhelpful and incompetent people you will ever speak to.  Do not ever use this company.  I think someone else noted that the only positive ratings will be from their own staff.  This is very believable.  
1837|the people that have put 5 stars are the ones that work for the company so ignore those comments as the rating are either 1* or 5* go on the martin lewis site or check out the guardian article too before you commit...i wouldnt touch them with a barge pole...they have agents that get money when they get you to sign up so they wont work in your best interest...if you do the research yourself you can get better deals...american company no doubt people will write all sorts about this review but all you have to do is research before you buy even they cant argue with that or can they???
1838|NEVER, EVER HAVE UTILITY WAREHOUSE. They are fine until there is a problem.I HAVE HAD NO GAS FOR A WEEK. The STAFF are SURLY, put me on hold for 8 mins. I explained myself simply but there couldn't grasp the basics of my problem. I moved to rented accommodation with a meter and said yes I'd have them as my new suppliers at my new address without any intention and didn't think much about it until it was eventually changed by them. Then there have been problems and I've put GBP120 on my card in 2 weeks and lost all the money on the card. I rang them up after the third attempt to get an answer, they said an emergency engineer was to be sent. When? Their reply can't say. 7 days or 3? Their reply I can't say. The staff were aggressive saying it was my problem. I kept all my receipts so they couldn't deny that I've not spent the money. AND I'M STILL WAITING! RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND NEVER LOOK BACK. I WILL.
1839|I used to be a distributor with these guys...brain washed isnt the half!!! americanised wooping and dancing in their annual events...the only people who make the real money are the ones that have been in from the start or if you know lots of people who are stupid enough to spend 200 quid...yes i did get my money back...was doing it for 2 years had 60+ customers a team and guess how much i was getting...GBP50 a month!!!! Anyway on to the services...energy, they say you pay a set ammount every month which is cheap...wrong!!! it goes up  a lot, there are lots of other companies who will offer much better prices, broadband...the uks best buy by which magazine..the only reason they win these awards is because you as a distributor are told to subscribe to it and then obviuosy vote for them...the broadband is rubbish. the only decent service they do is the mobile deals which are ok, the cashback card aint the crack they make out i spent GBP80 in asda cashback off that GBP2....loads of money off eh. Final bit if you are a tenant they dont want you..plain and simple they say tenants dont pay their bills,they blame the distributors for signing tenants up a friend of mine got expelled from the business as some of his tenants didnt pay...is that his fault??? surely a company should be credit checking/ Make you own mind up but i wouldnt touch these guys with a barge pole
1840|I joined the utilty warehouse 2 months ago, and so far I have found their customer service to be fantastic. I switch my gas, electric, phone and broadband over to them and all changed over with no problem at all. On the two occasions I needed to call them for assistance settings up my router, they were very helpful.
1841|after moving into my current property which is supplied by UW for the gas, i have recieved a bill of 337 for 2 months which is very over priced, iv tried to contact them but been unable to. iv also sent emails had had no responce. so i am now in the process of changing companys. by the sound of the rest of the reviews im better off changing and shall not be using my card to pay the bill!!!
1842|I was with Utility Warehouse and am sill getting bills now - 5 months after leaving them!!! I have wrote to them and disputed some bills (with random amounts added and no explanation given) and have not received any response. They have also sold the debt to another company so I am now getting hassled by both of them. They also refused to let me change supplier when I was struggling with their prices. As long as they're getting their profit, they don't seem to give 2 hoots about their customers. Believe me, if there were any compliments, I would give them but they have been one of the worst companies I have come into contact with!
1843|Excellent service, very good customers service, bills are very clear and easy to understand, would recommend to anyone. 
1844|Terrible company terrible customer services wanting a GBP300 deposit from us which they told us about in November GBP300 deposit to supply us they said if we give them d/d details we wouldn't need to pay , 3 months letter we get a bailiff letter !! even though we gave them d/d details . we had no letters or phone calls regarding this deposit then we get a bailiff letter ??? why is it every other company don't charge a deposit to go with them 
1845|I have been a customer of Utility Warehouse for over 3 years, taking gas, elec, broadcall and valuepay mobile. I have been very happy with all aspects of the service, prices and billing. We saved a huge amount of money on both our line rental, calls and energy.  It is a shame more happy customers do not write reviews, but it is the British way to complain rather than compliment. Sadly this gives an unbalanced view to those reading reviews!
1846|Looking through these comments, I'm gobsmacked at some of the bad reviews about their custimer service. I've been with them for 2 years now, and have to say its the best customer service I've had in a long long time. On the rare occasion I have a problem with my bill and call up, they are always cheery. I prefer to deal with one person, and this chap Mark always helps me. If hes not around, I ask whoever answers if they can get him to call me back, and he always does. I can't see that happening with Britsh Gas! My mother is in her 80s and is also with the Utility warehouse, and can be your stereotypical 'grumpy old lady', but even she has no reason to complain about them! I would recommend them to anyone and do!
1847|"I had to move out of my rented property to escape Utility Warehouse as they would not let me switch company and where charging me on average over GBP100 a month for very low gas & electric usage. UW charged me GBP220 the first month for gas and electric, I am a single person who lived in a 2 bedroom flat with just an immersion heater used once every 2 days, GBP388 the next month. On top of this they're CS line is 0844 costing 5p per a minute and the representatives are unhelpful, rude and argue on the telephone when you wish to make a complaint. They promise to phone back and don't. They are extremely obstructive if you wish to leave and will make ""mistakes"" to make switching to another company impossible and even told British Gas I had ""changed my mind about moving"". When I eventually moved out 2 months later received a bill for GBP100 including a GBP25 late charge, despite receiving no bills from them, and in their usual style they forged the final meter reading I had given them upon moving out, luckily I had photographed the meter reading as proof, knowing what sort of company I was dealing with by this point. Please save yourself a MASSIVE amount of stress, phone calls, correspondence, mistakes and miscalculations and do not join Utility Ware in the first place, there are a lot more reputable companies out there that have free customer service lines and friendly staff."
1848|When they're not lying to you, they simply don't give a response.  Fourteen times I've supplied direct debit information, all ignored or input incorrectly. Now they're charging me GBP6 a time for 'late payment' even though they've had my credit card details from day one!  They're cheap for a reason. Avoid.
1849|I can't begin to describe how much trouble myself and my flatmate have had with Utility Warehouse. 2 weeks after moving into a new flat we received letters stating that the previous tenants owed them GBP1200, and that they would send someone round to fit a pre-pay meter with the GBP1200 loaded onto it, so we would've had no electric until someone else had cleared their debt. we did what they asked and provided them with a tenancy agreement to prove we weren't who they were looking for, and now on top of our GBP200 electric bill (which is pretty reasonable) they've added GBP350 legal charges on for the pleasure of sending a bailiff round about SOMEONE ELSE's account. staff are very rude when we try and resolve the issue, they have told me specifically that they're charging us for the bailiff that they sent round regarding someone else's debt. absolutely outrageous, switching suppliers as soon as humanly possible.
1850|I have been with UW for about 4 years and have never had a problem. Customer services are excellent and their billing system is easy to understand. I have just finished a 12 month cycle of budget payments and rang them to discuss a couple of issues. They readilly agreed to re-imburse me with a GBP200 credit which I had built up and accepted my new monthly budget plan. My meter readings always show on my bill and their estimates, when I forget to ring my readings through, are always reasonable. When I took their broadband offer they were most helpful with all my questions - their broadband package is top rated by Which? magazine. I take gas, electricity, landline phone and broadband giving free landline calls in U.K. and 10 foreign countries.
1851|I've been with utility warehouse for a year now, so far so good, we conviniently receiving one statement for the for services I Had from them. I am enjoying my free international calls very much, I have to phone my dad and mom almost everyday now in America and some friends in canada. With my shopping I am enjoying my monthly cashback and because I have recomended six of my friends then they give me incentives to be deducted from my total bill each month. Got 3 kids to feed and the wife, with cheap bills I still got spare cash to spend to things we want. In the other hand I felt sorry for those who have utility warehouse as there supplier and for some reason it didn't  work for them.
1852|Their opening hours are shorter than other providers,the staff are less helpful and when you try to change suppliers they block it. I have several properties all with different suppliers, UW are undoubtedly the worst. 
1853|"This contract all seemed fine until we came to move house and wanted to close the account.  It will have taken nearly 2 months to close the account by the time it is finally sorted - meaning we have not been able to claim our deposit back form our landlord. This delayed process was not explained when we signed up and the ppl i have spoken too have been completely unflexible - basically ""that's the way it  is and there's nothing I can do about it."" Completely fed up with the entire process - no good at all for those who are renting a property."
1854|I've been with UW for 6 months, I have only ever had two problems. The first was just after I moved in. I called to give them my details and 3 weeks later I received a letter saying they had received no details and were going to cut the electric if they didn't hear from me. I left it and was never bothered again. The second problem was for one month i put in a wrong meter reading so the next month it estimated. I ended up with a GBP170 bill, I called them, they told me to send readings in for the next 3-5 days and they suspended the bill and DD. They said by the February bill it will have rectified itself because of the suspnsion. I will have to wait and see though.
1855|re Utility Warehouse  Business broadband & Telephones.  I requested in writing a transfer of all my business electricity, telephone & broadband to UW 6th August 2010. I specifically requested a static IP address on the broadband line.  By November 17th is was clear that this transfer had still not taken place and I communicated with UW to vent my frustrations.  The UW Customer Services manager declined to take my call.  In total I provided three different MAC codes to UW from my existing broadband supplier.I was assured in writing that the transfer would take place. Finally it did take place on 21st Dec and we were then unable to connect on the broadband line. Their customer service was closed all over the Christmas period so that we were without access ( at our busiest time of year) to our website & computer system until Jan 4th 2011.  I wrote to the Chairman of UW who responded, basically defending the high level of service offered by UW.  On Monday 24th Jan we checked the IP address on our network to make sure it was unchanging & we therefore reistated the enhanced login security features on our computer system. On Friday 28th Jan the IP address changed and we were locked out of our system & website etc.  On calling UW it emerged that UW had not assigned a static IP address and that it why it had changed.  At the time of writing our staff are still without our computer system ,waiting for our computer services company to bypass the security features on our system so that we can again have access to our website & computer system.  UW have declined  to reimburse me for any additional IT costs incurred nor for our lost productivity or administrative costs arising.        
1856|Having been a customer for two years initially for gas and electric, and then broadband and phone, I have been very happy with Utility Warehouse.   The bill is clear and concise and comes monthly instead of quarterly. I like having one number to ring in the event of a query. Customer services are quick to reach and happy to help, based in England.  In December they reviewed my energy payments against my actual usage and made it better by lowering the cost as my house was energy efficient enough to warrant paying considerably less - the bill was already smaller than my previous supplier (British Gas and N Power) to begin with.  Before I did that had ordered the Utility Warehouse cashback card. The card cost me GBP10 to set up, and after 6 months will cost GBP1 per month which I thought was an unusual charge to have. But in November December and January's bill it shaved GBP25, GBP35 and GBP40+ off by shopping in Asda, Sainsburies, Debenhams and elsewhere for Christmas shopping. This saved around 40% and I plan on continuing using it.   There are other benefits of being a club member I have not yet explored but it seems they are constantly finding new benefits for customers and acting in their interest to keep them which is encouraging.  I highly recommend the Utility Warehouse Discount Club.
1857|Please avoid yourself a lot of hassle and do not use this provider.  Not only was I double charged by themselves and BT for the same calls.  I was sent a debt collection letter for GBP2.76 when I cancelled my direct debit on an account that had been inactive for a number of years.  
1858|I have been a customer of Utility Warehouse for 3 years and I am very happy with the service provided and the charges. I take Gas/Elec/Broadcall and as a high user of both gas and electric I have found their prices much cheaper than British Gas and NPower who have both been previous providers. Think it depends on how much you use. I am v happy not to be paying British Telecom enormous amounts anymore for their line rental and astronomical charges(most quarters I was paying more for line rental/VAT than the cost of my calls!!)Also UW have real people that answer the customer service line 
1859|  I have just had my gas/elec bill for one month and even though myself and my husband work full time our bill was 176.00!!! time for a change 
1860|Arrogant and not user friendly. That it is the 12th year of the 21st century and they insist you write to them to request to pay by electronic transfer is is rediculous.  We tried to advise them as new customers our name for the account. No answer on the customer service number. We e-mailed them to get the bank sort and account codes. No response. Only now when they have daid that today our unpaid account is to be presented to court prior to disconnection can we reach them. How they are doing that when they don't even have a name on the account is beyond me and I suspect the courts too. If you want a service provider you can contact, these are not the people for you.    
1861|Mobile phones from Utility Warehouse..  I'm glad I have not used their Gas, Electric service because what they did with us, with mobile phone, every month has been a thorn for us, for sometimes.  We keep calling Utility Warehouse that when we get paid at end of month, it needs time to clear at bank. Every company we use have accomadated the direct debit and with the dates.  EXCEPT the pain in the ass Utility Warehouse.  They keep sending text messages EVEN after we keep telling them, to wake up. ...  
1862|I've just left Utility warehouse.  Tariff's are OK if you can't be bothered to look around and have multiple services but once you start taking an interest you realise there are better deals to be had.  There customer service is good, but don't forget you are being charged for the 0844 numbers and the pleasantries/time that go with it.  I found the GBP10 admin leaving fee an irritation having been with them for 5+ years.
1863|Whilst I can not fault UW's customer service their billing/accounts department is pathetic and have made one error after another. I have only been with them for four months and every month there has been a mistake and I am paying over the odds for these errors. In sept 2010 I phone UW and specify that i wish to be subscribe to their Unlimited Broadband package. I wrote it all down as my husband was going to ring them. So to cut a long story short ,  My first bill arrived , I was happy it was affordable and I did not check my bill. The second Bill in Nov arrived and was over GBP100 ... I studied the bill only to find out that I was not on Unlimited internet. I phoned Customer service who were polite , but said there was no record of me ever requesting Unlimited. I had to apy the Bill which I did but in 2 installments. Dec bill arrived and was only my Bill for Internet not phone . So in January needless to say I now have two bills to pay at once.In between all this I asked to have my number changed and was charged twice. Have been refunded though for that. How many mistakes can they make?    
1864|We recently switched from UW to another company as we couldn't make head nor tail of their gas bill and were being charged GBP1 per day if we went into the emergency on the electric. Today we received a letter saying we need to contact them about our electricity bill (we have a pre pay key meter), as there has been a door to door scam. I phoned UW and spoke to Sean, who told me we owe them GBP50. I told him this isn't possible as we've only ever topped up our key in our local shop. He just kept saying 'I'm sending you the invoice for GBP50'. I totally lost the plot because he wouldn't listen and kept repeating that he was sending the invoice anyway. Eventually my partner phoned and also spoke to Sean, who told him that, oh dear, I'm ever so sorry, this happened before you moved into the property. Not only do they charge more than other companies, their bills are totally unclear, and they accuse you of lying. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
1865|I have been with UW for about two years now and have, Elec/Gas/Phone/Broadband and have never had a problem with them. For people to say the customer service is awful must have had an attitude when talking to them to be like that as they have always been polite. Every time I have rung up they have been really helpful and sorted out the problem without any hassle and I would say out of the 5 or 6 times I have rung i have been cinnected within 15 seconds. The only time it took longer was when I rung up at 19:45 peak time. We had our phone/broadband go down the Tuesday before Christmas, I rang them up using my mobile as phone was too crackly and within 6 hours an engineer was around and fixed the problem! They also refunded me GBP2 to pay for my mobile usage! Our monthly outgoings is GBP100 this includes the use of the cashback card for food and fuel we normally save GBP25 on average each month. Not bad for a family of 4 and washing machine and tumble dryer on most days!  Oh and my broadband connection is over twice as fast as when I had BT. I get a solid 10mb download speed all through the day and night and with BT I was lucky to 4mb, very helpful when I am a web developer and also go online gaming with my PS3!
1866|After taking over a property with anexisting electricity supply from UW  I was consistently overcharged for estimates even though I had given actual readings.  They even took withdrawals from my account without my knowledge or permission through the use of a credit card I used one time to make a payment over the phone which caused me to go over my overdraft limit with my bank on two occassions and cost me GBP100 in bank charges.  They say it is in there terms and conditions to do this even if you do not have a direct debit set up.  What other utility provider would do this! It's bad enough that they caused me bank charges but to add insult to injury, after much letter writting and phone calls of complaint, they agreed ro pay me back GBP25.  That was 0n the 18th November 2010 and I still haven't received it.    They give every excuse for this.  1st promising to send a direct debit mandate which they didn't.  2nd a refund into my account - didn't happen.  3rd would send me a cheque which would take 10 working days, you guessed. 4th last week said they had put a BACS transfer into my account  8 days it still hasn't arrived.  I will call them again tomorrow to see what new lie they have lined up.  They only get a 1 star rating because 0 doesn't register  Steer clear of this company.  Terrible response to customer complaints
1867|Avoid at all costs. Worst customer services i have ever dealt with.  We had a problem on our meter, they accused me of lying for 5 weeks, denying the problem and 15 weeks later still not sorted and they currently owe me nearly GBP500! 
1868|been with UW for 4 yrs now-really good company-the icing on the cake is the cashback card-if you can put money on it you will save huge amounts off your bill on average i save GBP30-GBP40  a month. Great customer service-would never go back to BT and because the company doesnt waste money on advertising you know you will get a good deal.Thanks UW.
1869|Cannot believe some of the adverse comments.  Have Electric, (no gas in area), phone, broadband and mobiles.  Broadband Service is much better than previosly with Talk Talk, much cheaper and customer serice is second to none.  With cashback card have even had FREE electric for 2 months recently.  My mother is also a satified customer.  After 12 months her account is GBP300 in credit and she was offered an instant refund, but decided to leave it there for mmoment, unlike other companies who try and increase payments even when they are well in credit. Some of these other comments must be other utility companies, who tie you into contracts!
1870|I Joined The Utility Warehouse Thru a Friend And Will Never Look Back. not only do i get 10% off my bill thru getting my other friends to sign up too, i pay less than GBP110 a month for my phone, broadband, gas, elec, and my mobile, i use my cash back card to which gets me more money off my bill. there customer service is second to non. never to busy to deal with me, and there in england too so i can always understand what there sayin.you could do much worse than this company but i dont think theres any much better. i also like the fact i get all my service on one bill with a nice easy break down so i know what im spending, i cant see me ever changing provider again.
1871|My agent forced the UW on the tenants. Four months down the line UW broke into the house and installed their own pre payment meter in the house and left the house open. Reason -the tenants haven't changed over the account to their names and haven't send their tenancy agreement to them,which the tenants say they have . Now the UW are demanding  money to get the meter removed THUGS-please stay away from them
1872|Generally I have had an ok experience with them.  They reduced my utility bills pretty substantially, and their single monthy bill is a definite advantage.  I would however say that the broadband is very average and am about to swap providers, and the customer service is extremely limited.  In summary - no major issues, they did reduce my outgoings, but there is probably better value out in the market nowadays.
1873|Internet service very bad, phone service very bad, do not get intenet with this comapany it is very bad service. If you try to talk with customer's service people they have very bad actitude towars the customer, and try to blame you if anithing go wrong with either of their services that they provide.Value for money but you get what you pay for.
1874|Well Remi, good luck in getting your money back. Despite having to continually email them to get my account sorted, which after 8 weeks noiw, I have goods that actually work,  they now say they wont be paying back the GBP300 they took out my account on the 10th dec through my debit card until MID JANUARY 2012. Although by this time I will already have wrote to which?, watchdog, the ofcom ombudsman and the card processing complaints people. Theyre accounts 'team' were too busy, and refused to take it further, aka too bone idle and probably spending all week out on the pop. TIP FOR EVERYONE: If youre unlucky to be with UW, cancel your debit card and get a new one with a new number so the swines cant help themself then.
1875|I have only ever paid 1 bill to utility warehouse and that went smoothly. Until about 2 weeks after when 6 unknown payments came out of my account to UW, leaving me with just under GBP1 in my account. These transactions were not authorized or agreed to in any way by myself. I rung UW and complained and they seemed to have no record of these transactions and it took them a further 2 days to find them and to get back to me. When they found these problems they said it was due to an IT error and all of the funds will be credited back into my account. They said that this shouldnt happen again.  I was very happy to leave it there and see it as a simple mistake, however the fact that they took my whole balance and left me with only GBP1 i thought was very strange. Also HSBC, my bank told me nothing could be done about this because they admitted the mistake and refunded the money.  I thought the matter was resolved until 3 days ago when another unauthorized amount had been taken out of my account and then put back in 2 days later. This is not a simple mistake because it has happened TWICE! Utitilty Warehouse do not have my permission to borrow my money when they feel like it then give it back when they feel like it and not even inform me. I have called the company again and will be writing a letter to the manager to get a written letter that insures me that it wont happen again. I have changed my HSBC card so that they no longer have my card details and cannot BORROW MY MONEY WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE IT!  Something fishy is going on at their end and they are trying not to put their hands up and admit it. As soon as i can change my provider i will because this has been TOO MUCH UNNECESSARY HASSLE!
1876|"Utilities warrehouse telecoms and 'customer service haha What a nightmare.. AVOID. Call themselves award winning customer service? Non existent more like. For SEVEN weeks now I have had issues over faulty products theyve sent me, but still happily kept on charging line rentals...and when I canx my direct debit until they got it sorted, they still help themselves to funds out of my account from my debit card to the tune of GBP350!!! they refuse to reply to letters and complaints, and calls in to them just hang up when being ""transferred"" (so they can keep churning the call conection charges), thats if you can get through to them! And on the rare occasions that they say they have tried to call me, they still try to call a two year old obsolete number, instead of the number of the 'new' phone that was issued by them! If you want your communications screwed up, frustration, incompetance then UW is your best option. They even make BT and Br gas look good!!! Unfortunatly I had to select at least one star as there isnt a -5 stars option."
1877|You will find utility warehouse doesn't have the cheapest tarrifs on the market. However if you reguraly shop at sainsbury (and it has a petrol station too) then you have the ability to make it cheaper than any of the others simply by using their cashback card. If your wife shops alot like mine at debenhams, topshop (and loads of others) then you can save even more. No other utility co offers unlimited savings like this. Infact go out and buy your mates 200 fags at sainsbury for them and get them to give you the cash fro them. You will get about GBP3 quid off your bill just for being a go between! Amazing!  
1878|"If you're offered The Utility Warehouse, please DON'T switch to them even if they seem like a good deal, they'll just con you, I've been only for a few days with Gas and Electric services and then, the ""final bills"" keep coming, and as I've cancelled my Direct Debit, they still got my money because they ask your CARD details on the application form!, the CASH BACK cards, are a con as well as I didn't even activate them (of course never used it) and still I've got charged for cancellation fees on BOTH CARDS!!, Please don't think that I'm upset and that's why I'm writting this, is becaus I never write a review but NONE deserves this."
1879|just changed over from b.t on 13th and have had no incoming phone service since every time i phone tech support on hold for an hour at a time before giving up when i do get to speak to someone told its will be fixes soon,now 26 hours later and still the same.
1880|"Mobile phones from Utility Warehouse..  I'm glad I have not used their Gas, Electric service because what they did with us, with mobile phone, every month has been a thorn for us, for sometimes.  We keep calling Utility Warehouse that when we get paid at end of month, it needs time to clear at bank. Every company we use have accomadated the direct debit and with the dates.  EXCEPT the pain in the ass Utility Warehouse.  They keep sending text messages EVEN after we keep telling them, to wake up. Stop sending threats of our mobile phones will be barred, when they know the situation.  That they need to change the date of the direct debit for when the monies clear after wages are cleared. But they won't listen.  Same text messages, same arrogance, same ""no we won't change the date.""  Then I have no other alternative but move from Utility Warehouse pain in the neck.  I'll not be renewing my distributorship. I'm not letting any family, friends and anyone else go through the same hassle, every damn month from their useless customer service.  I said I'll give you a year to see how good your customer service is and not fall for the hype of money because I won't let my friends, family or any stranger be taken for ride.  Now - when mobile phone contracts are finished, I'll go somewhere else and I'll make sure, to air my opinion with people I know about Utility mess up. accomodating.   It's not hard to change dates for direct debit.   Big talk from Utility Warehouse but that's all it is."
1881|Inherited Utility Warehouse from previous owners. Checked prices against the cheapest on comparison sites and found them to be expensive. Called to tell them we would not be continuing with their services and was appalled by their attempt at customer service. I think the way that they do business via independent distributors is unsuited to the UK. All possitive posts of comments should be checked against the list of c.36,000 independent distributors if the company is willing to provide. Shoddy and unprofessional - beware.
1882|I would like to know why UW are willing to let a single mother with a 6week old baby site in a freezing flat due to your in ability to reset a gas meter in a timely fashion, without hearing rubbish about external contractors, and then financially rip that same mother off by telling her to top up the meter clearing off the previous tenants debt and failing to tell her to keep receipts until after the event so that she cannot now claim the money back.
1883|All I can say is 'tip top'. We wouldn't change to anyone else again! We save on average GBP25-30 a month just by shopping & then that comes off our bill!! What more could you ask for? Buying things we would normally buy & it reduces our bills to GBP50 a month! All on one bill, easy to read, all straight forward. You can actually make sense of the bill unlike other suppliers making it 'complicated' on purpose. So thank you 'Utility Warehouse' for coming into our lifes. It's made it 'hassle free' for us! One less thing to worry about! I recommend!!! *****
1884|Use for gas and electricity for over a year now, bills work out cheaper for us than any other supplier/tariff. I submit meter reading online every month and pay by monthly dd. Just checked tarrifs again and still the cheapest (elec is similar to other online options, gas is cheaper).  No minimum contract so can leave at any time if a better deal comes along. Hadn't heard of them until we moved house and this is who the previous owners were using.
1885|Been with the company over a year, extremely happy with the service we've had, saved us quite a lot on our previous company's gas and electric (Npower), our agent advised us of the best time to switch from BT to make sure we didn't incur any termination of contract charges (which we hadn't even been aware of) - honestly cannot fault them.  Only had to contact Customer Services once, very efficient, polite and helpful.  Does what it says on the tin!
1886|I've been with UW for just over a year now. Good value for money and good service. I have to particularly compliment the service helpline on the broadband. They really are very good.
1887|I have just read all the customer reviews, I have been with UW for 4 years now, I have gas, electric, phone, internet, mobile, dongle and a BB. for all these services my last months bill was GBP220 and I had GBP40.15 cashback off my bill which lowered it to GBP180! GBP180 for 7 services! Find that somewhere else! As for Broadband connection, had a problem once and that was the whole area, down to a problem with the lines. I find customer services charming, english speaking and very helpful, nothing is too much trouble! They answer calls quite quickly and if you have to wait longer than 15 secs to speak to someone, then put the phone down and try again later. Thats what i was told by the distributor that signed me up 4 yrs ago! Its up to you whether you give them a try but theres no contract and when i tried them, i liked them!
1888|The negative comments here are just too ludicrous to be true. Some people, probably failed UW distributors, seem to spend half their sad lives filing rubbish against the company. I've been with them nearly 2 years. Gas & Elec are on a par with big 6 but I save loads each month with free calls, cheap line rental/Bb. The best thing is their Cashback card. Takes on average GBP50 off my bill each month. Remarkable.
1889|I have been with Utility Warehouse for 6 months now, and I am amazed by some of the negative comments, Not my experience! My family have 1 mobile, Internet, telephone, gas and electric, and all on one bill it saved us about GBP25 a month on a GBP130 avarage spend. I was convinced to try this cashback card, my wife loves it and saves us about another GBP60 average per month, so our actual bill is about GBP45-GBP50 a month all in! I just urge you to try them, as far as I am aware I am not even locked in to any contracts, so can leave them whenever.. hope this helps..family of 5.I just wish I had believed the blurb earlier on this cashback card thing, it really works
1890|Where else can you get incredible discounts on your utility bills and also have unlimited cash-back on all your shopping! This is what makes the Utility Warehouse so fantastic and unique. Obviously they are not 100% perfect - this is impossible to achieve They answer your calls within 15 seconds and if they are busy then they actually tell you how long they will keep you waiting - this is really helpful as you can call them back at a quieter time.  personally i am getting about 6 months free bills every year! 
1891|What a load of rubbish this so called company is, I was dropped off my broadband about 15 times in as many minutes one evening. There's nothing good about utility warehouse, DON'T USE THEM!! 
1892|WHAT A USELESS TEAM.I GOT INTO DEBT, I AGREED TO GAS METER WHICH I HAD, ELETRIC METER, WELL SAY NO MORE.3 TIMES I WAITED IN FOR THE METER AND DIDNT TURN UP.I SPOKE TO THE RUDEST MAN EVER, ASKING WHY I WAS I DEBT.WAS PAYING GBP60 FOR GAS, GBP45 FOR PHONE,GBP35 ELETRIC.I DONT THINK THATS CHEAP.PLEASE DONT GO WITH THEM.WHICH I HAD KNOWN MORE ABOUT THEM BEFORE GOING WITH THEM.
1893|I used to be a distributor for this co and I myself have endured endless mnobile equipment problems and products that dont work, customer services is a joke where you try and call but get repeatedly cut off, they refuse to answer emails, complaints and are simply not bothered... I have jacked  in the distributor ship as I cannot look someone in the eye and recommend such a shoddy oufit. Unfortunatly to post this review I have had to award at least one star. nightmare. avoid. makes BT look like guardian angels!!!
1894|AVOID THIS COMPANY! NOT CHEAP! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Even BT is better!! If you see 5 stars it must be an agent from this company...It is the worst company I came across...Rude, swearing agent... I never received any postal bills...When I asked to get it by email they could not do it!!!???? How much cost an email and how difficult it is to send bills by email... So still don't received automatically my bills...I have to chase them every months to get my bill which is wrong every month!!! I live in a studio and it cost me GBP120 per month! This company is a joke... They want do anything for you, except if you sign up as an agent to sale their expensive products to your friends... They are not providers but retailers...Simply avoid it if you want to stay away from troubles...
1895|I never intended to use Utility Warehouse. My estate agent made this all happen for me before I realized what happened. By that time it was too late to get out. Before I changed to UW my energy bill was only GBP60 per month. After I changed my energy bill rocketed to GBP108 per month which was a complete rip off. Unfortunately I could not change until I moved out of the property. You just need to see their monthly bill which looks sooo unprofessional and confusing. Once I took the monthly bill of UW to my bank to provide proof of address and my bank told me that they cannot accept it as proof of address as it look everything else than a utility bill. Hahahahahahaha.....I must admit that the customer service people have been friendly on the phone and were trying to help however it did not reduce my energy bill. After only 6 month they increased my monthly bill by 15% which was outrageous even though I was using rather less energy than more. For me UW is more like a con company than a utility company and would everyone to stay away from them. 
1896|When I signed up with them it was efficient and easy. It was all done on the phone and everything came on the same bill.  However, when I moved out, nothing could be done on the phone. They sent forms to me and I then had to get the new people to fill it in and send it. For some reason they are unable to send forms to people who are not already customers. So this only works if the new people play ball.   I have been paying GBP58 a month since June for someone else to enjoy all four services. Although it has finally just been transferred the Utility warehouse say I can't get a refund and they can't deal with me as I am now a third party.  Brilliant!  If you use this company I msuggest you get the forms long before you move, fill them out yourself and force the people that move in to sign it before you hand ove any keys 
1897|don't listen to all the negative guest reviews as prob other energy companys views not really people , been with utility warehouse for over 2 years now and cannot speak any more highly of there 5 star cust service and so helpful etc , contracts what contracts , i give them my meter reading ever month and pay for what i use , i get elec and gas ,broadband and phone for GBP120 a month , which is amazing, hope you find this review helpful.
1898|AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!!! I moved into a small flat last year and the estate agent told me that Utility Warehouse was value for money. I though since I am hardly in my flat that I wouldn't have a hugh bill. Soon after I received a bill for GBP190 for one month. The bills kept coming every month GBP145, GBP168, GBP172. In total it all came to 1100.00. I called them to try and sort it out but I was told that I needed to pay up or they would refer it to a debt collection agency. I received 3 warning letters all within one week to tell me to pay up. I am at my wits end and in the process of contacting the Ombudsman to try and get this sorted.   I checked out Scottish Power and they quoted me GBP507 and British Gas quoted GBP512.   Please do not make the same mistake I did and stay away from this company. It borders on theft. 
1899|WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. UW continued to bill my account after we moved out of the flat and we had a proper exit inventory, so i sent them an email asking them to check my account and give me a refund. this was in AUGUST, and i still havent received it. i've sent them more than 10 emails already but the customer service staff is quite dumb that they simply send me the same replies. they charged us a lot more than we actually used anyways!!! (aren't we supposed to get a refund on the credit which was not used? which, in our case is nearly 300 pounds.) this is a stupid company, i do NOT recommend them to anyone.
1900|Been with UW for 18 months.  We have Telephone, Broadband, Gas & Electricity.  Our monthly spend has fallen from over GBP200 to less than GBP100.  Can't believe it to be honest, it almost seems too good to be true.  The Cashback card is quite extraordinary.  If you have a Sainsburys close by, it's a no-brainer.  I reckon a lot of the negative stuff on this site must be posted by their competitors, we all know what the Big 6 are like.  The Which? magazine and the Sunday Times both rate UW as the top Company - I'd rather believe them than some anonymous blogger.  Keep up the great work, UW!
1901|Utility Warehouse is simply a supplier, they say they are the cheapest, somebody needs to speak to advertising standards authority!!! Just don't miss a payment or they become the most expensive. I am going back to BT and EDF
1902|"I've neen with UW for 3 years. They had me locked into a contract that I couldnt get out of!!! Initially I saved money, not a lot, but I did save right up until I realised that the meter readings werent correct. I phoned in and spoke to a very helpful advisor who told me they'd re-calculate my bill and the next month it was incorrect again. It went on like this for months until I got a whopping bill in April 2009 for GBP385! They apologised for not entering the data correctly and insisted I had to pay it immediately which I couldnt afford to do. I arranged payments in installments over 13 mths of GBP85 plus my monthly bill as normal. 2009 to 2010 was the same issue. Even when the meter was read by one of their representatives the bill was still Estimated and low and behold on 24th September 2010 I got another whopping bill (having just cleared my arrears from the previous yr) for GBP1011.00 which they were going to take by DD on 30th of Sept and again I phoned in and complained. Im absolutely sick & tired of this company's inability to charge for the correct usage & I have cancelled my DD through my bank until they can bill me correctly. There's 2 of us living in a 3 bed semi and my annual utility bill is GBP2500 because of their mistakes! On top of this I feel no benefit to their ""membership"" which they charge me for every month and my phone line was never any cheaper than anyone else, its actually more expensive in the long run! Absolutely horrendous company to deal with and I would never recommend using his company to anyone. AVOID AT ALL COST & DONT BE TAKEN IN BY THE HYPE. I'm just hoping that despite the arrears with UW i can get out and go with another company. If UW have their way I'll always be in arrears - they're a bit like the CSA - they make the bill up as they go along!! And just so you know, I havent had Gas running through my property since 2007 and I still I get billed monthly in the region of GBP50 - Hilarious!!!"
1903|Don't believe the hype you'll read elsewhere. It was probably written by one of UW's evangelists.  I was stupid enough to throw almost everything in with UW. Home 'phone, broadband, gas and electricity. This has proved to be a BIG mistake.  The home 'phone switch over from Sky went smoothly. This evening, 5 days after I was promised UW's broadband connection would be working it's finally burst into life. The trouble is I'm sat in a pokey bedroom on the end of an ethernet connection because the Thomson TG 585 v8 wireless router has a pitifully short range.  In fact, it can't communicate with wireless devices just 10 feet away horizontally - its vertical range is even shorter. This is after trying to connect wirelessly with a laptop, netbook and iPhone.  Sky's, by comparison, was akin to Jodrell Bank.   Yes, I am going back to Mr Murdoch. Always expensive, but undeniably reliable. And yes I'm cancelling my gas & electricity deal with UW - I fear I'll freeze to death this winter if I trust them to supply the fuel. 
1904|The reading I had were checked each time I got a bill.When I changed to another company They said I owed them GBP600 WHICH WAS NOT TRUE,after arguin with them they said they had made a mistake.I owed them GBP365 which a payment plan was set up in June 2010.Today 26/10/10 I get a phone call of a debt recevory agent threatning me about the debt I owe to them.I spoke to Utiliy Warehouse they said it was there mistake,and they will set up another payment plan.They said they will phone debt recovery .I have checked my bank statement and they have taken out payments.This company wants shutting down.I am completley stressed.DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING,THEY ARE A BUNCH OF LIARS CHARGE YOU MORE AND REFUSE TO LISTEN TO YOU.THEY ARE RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT
1905|"Averagely Priced. Surcharge unless paying by direct debit.  When we first joined...there was a card paying system on the phone for paying bills.  This seemed to ""disappear"" after a few months. Estimated usage - unless you provide readings each month.  This leads to overcharging. Recieved 4 lots of application forms in two days for their ""discount club"".  Did not sign up for this but was still charde GBP1.50 a month for the ""privilege"". Requested credit to be forwarded on closure of account - yet to recieve cheque 3 weeks after requesting."
1906|We switched to Utility Warehouse a little over 12mnths ago. So far they've overcharged us by GBP665 for gas and over GBP140 electricity. Their customer service is dreadful. Today I waited over 30mins on hold and spoke to three different people to be told that I had to wait another six weeks to receive the money that they have overcharged me back. Yes, thats 6 weeks to receive my GBP800+.They did not ammend my direct debit payment to correctly reflect our usage when requested either. They said the reason was that I'd missed their billing circuit by this time of the month, even though my bill is not due to be paid until 29th. So, I've cancelled my direct debit and will be switching suppliers. Apart from this rediculous situation, they are not cheaper either and I've worked out that by being with E-on we'd be over GBP300 better off
1907|i dont know what you have done to my phone line at 9 chestnut drive put i cannot make any out going calls you better get this shorted by to-night and put me back with bt or i will see legal advice as i told you i did not what to change my phone until may 2011 and i dont think i will be changeing over put just sort my phone line out for to-day because if you dont my husband will be on the phone and he is not very happy with you i am going to change my gas and electric back to who i was with before i dont what any thing to do with utility warehouse again BUT PUT MY PHONE LINE BACK WITH BT TO-DAY GOD HELP YOU IF IT IS NOT PUT RIGHT MRS SANDRA BARKS MEMBERSHIP NUMBER IS    5854450
1908|Utility Warehouse is not cheap (you have to spend more money with them to save more. UW is not well run - their admin systems are inefficient. UW is a pyramid scheme, where your bill pays partially into other people's bills. UW makes empty promises to people about making money. UW is a POOR POOR company, and I have a stack of paperwork with complaints about them. AVOID!!!
1909|We have been a customers with Utility Warehouse for over a year and have seen our bills cut by around GBP150 a month! Some of this is by using the brilliant cashback card for our shopping and petrol at Sainsburys which gets us averagely GBP20-GBP30 a month off. But we are also seeing great savings on our enery bills and telephone and broadband. Just fab! Some people moan about having big bills at the end, but you have the responsibility for setting your monthly direct debit amounts and so by reading your meter regularly and keeping yourself on track you don't end up either with a big bill or the company having loads of your money.
1910|Been with them for 4 months now and have had nothing but problems! They got our account wrong and wrote to us saying they were going to cut off our gas and electric even though we paid and they admitted this was their mistake. Another time they mixed our bill up with our landlord who is with utilities warehouse but living at another address they said all they can do was spread the cost over a period of time which was fine but then received a letter saying we could not do this and they were going to take it all. Recently we had a call to say we owe even more money to them! we agreed this payment on the 17th september they said its been approved, so we assumed the money has been taken that day. 3 weeks later they only just taken the money out!!! called them and they had no explanation for this money taking 3 weeks to come out!! we are now left short til payday and they refuse to refund us til we next get paid!  Bad company would not recommend!!
1911|Utility warehouse blatantly lie.... they are not cheaper than british gas or BT..it is all clever wording..british gas are much cheaper in most regions for gas and electricity dual fuel.. You would be suprised how many mugs fall for there lies..
1912|Been with them for over 4 years now. Brilliant customer service, Brilliant service and cheap as well. With their new cashback card which i use when i go shopping i save about GBP40.00 a month on my bill.
1913|We have been with them for about 4 years, can't recommend them too highly.  We have all services with them including 2 mobiles and have always found them to be pleasant and helpful.  Definately saves us money.  Can't understand why anyone with a problem doesn't get back to the rep who signed them up!!!  An excellent company with the lowest rates and cashback of aprox GBP20 per month off our bill.
1914|I have been with them for about 14 months now for energy phone and internet.  Really happy with the service.  My bills are really clear and I get them every month which is much easier to work out my finances. The best bit is the cash back card and the cheapest online shopping. In general I am saving about GBP25 per month off my food and petrol. This month I bought a digital SLR Camera for my passion. I managed to get it  GBP300 cheaper than I could find anywhere else on the net by using their search engine.  This is going to giving me another GBP55 cash back off next months bill, so I cant wait for that.  
1915|I have nothing but praise for this company, at every stage of the contract set up, switching over and ongoing customer services, they have been excellent.  I use phone/broadband, Gas/Electric and also their cashback card, it has been very postive on the amount of money we pay out every year on utilities and phone bills.  Not only that it is all on one clear bill.  Excellent idea.
1916|We joined UW to take advantage of the cashback card which reduces your bills for utility services. The normal service cost are there or there abouts with the rest of the market however the cashback really does enhance them. Great in principle.  The experience was a complete disaster, cashback top up transactions were duplicated and resulted in my debit card being lock by my bank for suspected fraudulent activity. When I took the matter up with customer services by email they did not respond, when questioned on the phone they denied receiving the emails and became very aggressive despite the fact I had received an auto acknowledgement. When we did eventually get to discuss the problems they continually tried to blame me for putting the transactions through twice albeit it was physically impossible as the transactions were just 3 seconds apart. When I persisted and kept going through the facts they eventually conceded that there was a problem with their systems which they knew about albeit no real apology was made nor responsibility accepted. When I subsequently discussed it with their agent she was also aware of the problem and had experienced it several times.   I think this say much about the company, don't be fooled by the gloss on the opportunity the shine will soon ware off.  In veiw of the attitude I have lodged a formal complaint with OTELO as my services were telephone related.      
1917|I have been looking at the reviews from some unhappy former customers of the Utility Warehouse and it struck me that I would not write a review if I was a bit thick and could not spell. Some people are just professional moaners like the majority of the people who wrote these reviews. I will remain a happy customer of the Utility Warehouse and not expect some kind of God like perfection from any company. I would recommend Utility Warehouse to my friends and do.
1918|Avoid at all costs. They offered me a package with set gas and electric bills for 3 months based on the average usage of the property ( a two bedroom flat ). As I was hardly there at the time it seemed a good offer. I pay all my bills by internet banking and was assured I could pay that way, in fact they will agree to any of your requirements initially to get you to sign up. When my first bill arrived I was informed I must set up a direct debit. Suspicious of this I kept putting them off and callling each month to make my monthly payment over the phone. When the third bill arrived there was an extra 60 quid on there which was my penalty fee for not having a direct debit with them even though I had paid all the bills on time! When I called up the customer service was disgusting, I was basically told at the end of a long drawn out argument to 'just give us your bank details'I gave them my details unwillingly but thought I would monitor this and cancel the direct debit a day before it was due to come out. Good job too as now my 3 months fixed pricing had stopped I was billed for the last month at 83 pounds. I had spent three evenings in the property that month. It was an estimate apparantly.  Watch them and do not be forced into taking a direct debit out as they will take any amount they want from there and their customer service is amaturish. I canniot understand how people get away with tradin in this fashion.
1919|"Have been with Utility warehouse for 14 months and paying a set amount arranged by them based on home, people and usage information and a massive recommendation from the landlord. We left the property end of August and gave in our meter readings, as we have done every month.  Today I received my final bill with a new ""reconciliation"" section asking for nearly what I paid for the whole year as my final bill.  For GBP136 a month for gas and electric over the past 14 months, giving them readings every month, they have asked for nearly GBP1700 as my final bill... DISCOUNT???   Avoid this company. Worked out it would have been cheaper to stay with Eon or even British Gas."
1920|This company is outrageous AVOID at all costs I've have a 2bedroom flat and have been with them for two years after they where recommended by my landlord the bills where a little high between 70 and 110 pound for electricity 6months into my tenacy they sent me a bill for 600 as a estimate which as you can imagine I thought this was a little strange they explained to me that I had not givin a reading when I moved in and this was a estimation of what I owe! Immediately I begin to search this company online and found a string of bad reviews and complaits. So I decided to pay the bill and imediately switch my provider only to be told by eon that I had a outstanding debt and could not transfer my provider. So I contacted utility warehouse and by the way these people are extremely rude and unprofessional. I was put threw to there definition of a manager who was probably shareed more traits with a monkey than a manager to be told that they had under estimated there own estimate by 1100 pounds I could not believe it. I refused to pay anymore money obviously however after several threating letters from them I called and a ranged for a prepayment metre to be installed this was a mistake because now they have set a debt on the metre of 45.25 per week which means I have to put on 45 plus what ever electric I use I still can't believe it now I have since found out that my landlord has shares with this company and many of his tenants are now in a simarl situation to my own it's been 3months into my metre and I've putt well over 800 pounds into it only to be sent a bill days ago for 5500 pound I'm currently seeking legal advice avoid this company at all cost research it and do not believe the propaganda that has been strategically place on web sites by the shareholders to discredit com plaits like my own avoid avoid avoid good look  Peace to all 
1921|The worst gas and electric company I have ever come across. Poor customer service and im still paying off my previous tenants debt as they cant seem to understand she no longer lives at the address despite me sending over a tenancy agreement over 3 times, and if they cant deal with your query they put the phone down. I stayed with this company as the account was already set up but am changing back to british gas ASAP!!!
1922|I have been with Utility Warehouse for 13 months.  So far so good.  I am very happy with my electricity, telephone, internet and mobile just paying GBP77.00 per month for these services.  If I get a massive bill at the end, I will let you know, as some have claimed.
1923|I have been with UW club for over 5 years, Like any company they have faults but doesn't every company? The Broadband and phone package is very good I pay GBP20 a month for all calls line rental and fast broadband, the service is excellent (they actually use Opus telecom same as talk-talk) and because I have my gas/electric with them I get free calls 24/7. You can get cheaper energy but if you use their cashback card overall it can save you about GBP20-GBP25 a month extra and M+S have just joined so you can get 5% off there as well. In sumary you need to take at least 4 services to benefit from the savings. not recommened if you just take energy.
1924|Having moved into this house more than a week ago, I am still blocked from using my previous supplier EDF because the previous owner didn't pay his bills. Utility Warehouse are in absolutely no hurry to lift the block even though they had absolute proof from my solicitor of my ownership and responsibility for this house the moment that completion took place.   Getting through to the UW call centre takes ages and they have absolutely no official complaints procedure, nor, unlike other suppliers, do they provide any official communication channels with the government watchdog Consumer Direct. I wouldn't touch them with a bargepole if only I could avoid it.
1925|I have been with them for a few months now, I was very unsure about their ability to cut my Gas & Electric monthly bills by more than half,(being a Yorkshire man who can peel an orange in my pocket!!)it is early days yet but I uncovered my previous Electric cough supplier(Southern)had over charged me and by sticking by my guns with them they owned up to have incorrectly tried to over charge me by GBP500.00 when I switched to Utility Warehouse-the savings are their to be had with them-but and this is the big BUT you could be very much face big bills with them by your own fault and not realise it-by for example having you heating on for that extra 2 hours a day 7 days a week 12 months a year thinking Oh well it's cheap and same as the electric-leaving lights on becasue you think it's cheaper to-so the art of it in my thoughts is to check your meter readings on the bill each month against your actual readings and if you notice you are using more than you thought just contact them and adjust the payments instead of not bothering and then being faced with a monster bill and blaming somebody else?? p.s. I am not a sales person for them!!! this is my own opinion-but as said early days yet but happy with their servises, my rating is low to reflect the short lenght of time I have been with them so far.
1926|Cheap bills?!  I have been a customer with Utility Warehouse for 6 years, my mobile phone is out of warranty by 1 month (contract renewed on 28th July 2009) and has stopped working.  All they can offer is for me to get it repaired privately, send it in to them for GBP18 and get them to have a look at it and then let me know how much it would cost or alternative cancel my contract and pay them GBP208!!!!  Customer service?  I think not!!!!  I definitely would not recommend this company - steer well clear!
1927|I would not recommend Utility Warehouse to anyone. They claim they read my meter wrongly, and took only 4 rather than 5 digit reading in a previous property I was renting, and then nearly a year later took GBP600 out of my bank account using my monthly direct debit to cover the mistake. When I asked for explanations they were rude and patronising. And when I got the bank to credit back the money from them until I had a proper explanation, they cut off my Telephone and Broadband. They are extremely unprofessional in their approach to customer services. It has taken over a year since to sort the discrepency out whilst involving the Ombudsman. 
1928|Utility Warehouse have tried to rip me off. I moved into a flat which already had Utility Warehouse as a provider. They put me on an extortionate rate and then sent me a bill for over GBP200 for a one bedroom flat with economy 7 heating, when eon only charge me GBP40 a month. I'm currently in disputes with their collections agency.  The unprofessionalism of this company is absolutely shocking. Whatever you do do not go with this company.  I can tell you with my experience of eon so far they have been great value for money, and you can also collect tesco clubcard points with them which makes it even better value.
1929|So Impressed, have been using Utility Warehouse for the last year.  Great Cashback using the card, got 30% off my bill last month.  Can't believe all the negative feedback as was recommended by my Dad,   Dad spent ages researching and is very careful, so I always take his advice.  He always looks at WHICH! magazine.  Utility Warehouse are the Best buy for Broadband. I rang customer services to speak about my bill, I got through in about 30 seconds, and spoke to an english person who sorted the problem really quickly.  Compare that to BT/British Gas where you wait for 30 minutes and then get cut off.  Our advice, try it, make your own decision.
1930|having been with utility warehouse for a few years,my bills just kept increasing to a ridiculous price,i have since moved to british gas where i give them a meter reading every month and my bills are so much cheaper it's a huge saving.my advice is stay away from these i also had to pay nearly GBP300.00 to leave them.AVOID AVOID AVOID IF YOU DONT WANT HUGE RIP OFF BILLS.
1931|The best advice if thinking of changing to The Utility Warehouse : AVOID AVOID AVOID!! Not cheaper than BT and British Gas that they claim . Expensive
1932|I am sick with this company. If you are a new customer, they answer your call swiftly but if you are not, the system puts you on hold for ages that you have to pretend your phone bill. Yet, no problem is sorted for you. I called to talk to a customer service (after being on hold for 30 minutes!!!) and asked if they could take meter reading as well. They did but on the receipt of my bill, they didn't!!! Now I'm moving and they still owed me a lot and I don't want to pay for this until the final bill comes out so that I know that they will deduct all the debts THEY owe me. I call and on hold and on hold and on hold. I'm really upset with this company. I wouldn't use it at the beginning but the landlady just had this one. I'm soooo upset if you could imagine. Never been on hold with any customer service as long as this company. They said they pride themselves on customer service. My suggestion? DONT USE THEM
1933|"Originaly given monthly electricity payment amount lots cheaper than Scottish Power our then current supplier of gas & electric. GBP32.00 per month we gave Utity warehouse all readings when requested and after 12 months we find ourselves owing them GBP970 more for electricity due to there poor estimating. Amazingly the gas estimate was 99% accurate.I feel they deliberatly under estimate to be cheaper than everyone else so they can rip your trousers off a year later after you have used the electricity.I only got appology from customer services even after letter of complaint was sent.No offer to reconsidder the outstanding amount was made,only the ""sorry about that poor estimate"" This company should be investigated... If you ever get the chance look at the DVD for becoming a distributor for them,Then you wonder who pays for the Porsche,s and new Mini,s we do. We are going back to our old supplier."
1934|after being with them for a year we were sent a yearly review, wow what a shock we were intially put a budget plan very cheap we thought.What a shock we had after a year has passed our electricity was  734.13 deficit. Our gas was in credit thank god. I could not understand why utilty did not change/inform us of our useage and increase our payments.Now they expected us to pay 161.00 per month to cover the deficit.When asked if they could take a lowr payment, they said it wouldnt be beneficial to us,what would have been BENEFICIAL would have been a warning of a payment increase 9/10 months ago!!
1935|I was promised that my bills would be cut in half........ how wrong can you be my previous provider cost me GBP70.00per month, and although when i joined this company my monthly bill was GBP35.00, it has now gone up to GBP120.00 and rising.. whilst I was at work they came and fitted a meter with a warrant, and said it was because my payments were not covering my bills. i made a direct debit on 30/07/10 for GBP120.00 and a meter was fitted 04/08/10 only 5 days later........ how do they work that out. Where do they get there figures from how can they be allowed to do this to people......... ROB DOGS Should be there name.  NO OVERALL RATING (PANTS)!!!!!
1936|I have been with Utility Warehouse for 9 months. I find the customer service superb. Always Helpful and they answer the phone usually wihin 15 seconds. If they need to investigate they take owneship, they dont pass me to someone else.  They even give me their name and extension number so I cna talk to the same person again...what a breath of fresh air..good old fashioned customer service, and they are based in the UK!   I love my cash back card. I am not only paying less for my services, but in addition I am reducing my bills my 29% month after month after month.  I dont understand some of the reveiws on here, they cant be using the same company as me I love it and recommend them to my friends
1937|I joined UW having read good review about them and their cashback card scheme. Be careful as it looks good on initial inspection their charges (monthly fee for membership, monthly fee for each card which they hadn't mentioned, charge for each top up etc). When i joined they said i would get a cashback on purchases from sainsburys however having noticed that i didn't get any cashback on petrol I was told that this was only if i spend GBP50 a month on food as well. I called them to cancel the card and am told that they can only send a cheque for the balance (despite having my account details) and they will charge me for that. I'm sure its all in the small print but like most people I hate being cheated and non-customer friendly attitude - best to avoid them.  
1938|"This is actually the worst company I've ever come across, and I should know first hand as I used to work for them [not as one of their distributors]. They charge whatever they want to and when customers call in all they get is ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" People make up the rules there and then and convice that they are inthe terms and conditions. At first glance everything looks fantastic and cheap, but once youve read the small print, you'll see what I mean. I'll give you an example....So you get the cahsback card to save money. Initially the card costs you GBP10. then each top up is charged at 35 pence, even more when done by credit card and there are stipulations on how it works with the petrol. They quote themselves as being cheaper then British Gas..howver this does NOT include dual fuel discounts or direct debit discounts. They only offer two days of payment, the 1st of them month and the last working day of the month which is pretty stupid seeing as they are only a couple apart. You get charged 10% moreif you dont pay by direct debit. If your bill is late for any reason they cut you off and then say they worte to you, which they probably did,. but as they are too cheapto pay for firs class mail you wont actually receive a letter advising you tat they cut you off until after youve been cut off.JUST SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME STRESS AND ENERGY AND STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW. UTILITY WAREHOUSE REALLY ARENT WORTH THE HEADACHE."
1939|Been with this mob for three months,internet is down 50% of the time,but they refuse to refund 50% of my bill.Keep you waiting when you ring them,they just keep you on hold until you go away.I have phoned them 15 times this week,they answerd the phone twice and just feed you a load of old bull.BEWARE you have been warned.
1940|"Terrible service.   They overcharged me every month, even though I had to give them readings every month. My bills gradually went up from ~GBP45 to a whopping GBP150 a month based on estimates... I'm a single guy living in a small flat, so no idea how they came up with the numbers.  Many phone calls and repeated ""OK, thats sorted for you now Mr. Gerrard, the amount will be settled on your next bill"" from service reps who obviously don't know what they're doing.   I have now left them, and they owe me GBP250. Three phone calls over two months and they have yet to send the cheque they promised me. Avoid these jokers like the plague, they will mess you around and make life very difficult.   On moving out of my flat the letting agent asked which utility supplier I was with and when I said the Utility Warehouse he remarked ""Oh god, not those idiots"". Enough said really.   "
1941|i had been with utility ware house for 3 years,i had all my utilitys with them even my mobile phone but the bills kept creeping up each month until it was ridiculous what i was having to pay,so the first thing i wanted to change was my mobile,what a hard time that was they wanted to charge me GBP20.00 for a puk code everywhere else it's free i managed to argue that one and did not pay,then i decided to change my gas/electric they tehn said i had to give 30 days notice (2months later i am still receiving bills from them)then i changed my phone/broadband same again 30 days notice (still receiving bills but for a much higher fee they are now charging me GBP35.00 for my wireless router in rental that i dont even use and have only just found out i need to return it but guess what IT'S NOT FREEPOST i have to pay or they will carry on charging me rental my advice is they are all lovely when you go with them but when you want to leave they are a nightmare AVOID AVOID AVOID IF YOU WANT A QUIET LIFE.
1942|Utility Warehouse are quite possibly the most incompetent company I have ever come across. I decided to take their phone and broadband services due to the simple fact that they have a 'No minimum contract' scheme available. Therefore this review is purely in relation to those specific services, not their gas and electricity plan.  First of all, the internet is constantly down on an evening. As I am sure that most people are aware, the most favoured time to peruse the internet is on an evening, when one is not at work or otherwise engaged.  The second most prominent predicament is the fact that their website is completely useless. Up until now I have received two bills, admittedly I was sent an email to my registered account informing me that my bill was now ready, however, could I get in to my online account to view said bill? Of course not. Apparently my account number does not exist. This is pretty much a de ja vu situation of my last bill. Eventually I had to email the company for help, which they did within a couple of days. When I finally managed to enter my account the bill appeared for several seconds before vanishing. I had already checked the box saying that I would like my bills through email and not through the site but this was not to happen.   I have called the company helpline several times and twice received the message that their number does not exist. Their website is now showing the message 'We are experiencing network issues, which may lead to a temporary interruption to email services for some customers. We are working to resolve this as soon as possible.' I would certainly not recommend this company to anybody who wishes to have a reliable internet service.
1943|I was really unsure and nervous about moving to them, but having been with them for well over a year now, I sing their praises to everyone!  There are some really silly comments on here about how expensive they are and all that jazz, and almost without question those who are critical are just looking to blame someone else for their own inefficiencies.  Unfortunately this is only too common in this day and age where people don't want to take responsibility for their own actions!  Anyway, UW are a terrific Company, with great products, and as was explained when we joined, if you use the Cashback card you have a MASSIVE effect on your bills each month.  Now they've got this new online shopping thing as well (I haven't got to grips with that yet, but I'm told it's great and I'm sure it is), I'm not going anywhere!!!!!  Thanks Utility Warehouse!
1944|Moved into a shared house and started paying the gas & elec with UW. They said as I was a new customer (the house had been with UW for a long time) I had to get in contact to stop them adding 10% to my G&E; bills. I could save another 10% if I signed up to their membership scheme. I called them, told them I wasn't sure about signing up and then got the first monthly bill for GBP258! I set about changing to a new supplier but they delayed it until we'd used enough units to justify their unbelievable rates (took 6 weeks). Their only explanation was if I'd signed up to be with them forever more, I'd would have received normal market prices. Criminal!
1945|I joined Utility Warehouse in April for my energy and telephone and saving nearly GBP400 a year over British gas and BT! Customer service is great and the distributor who signed me up keeps in touch to answer any of my queries. Doing broadband and mobile once contracts are up with BT. I recommend it to all my friends!
1946|How are people finding UW more expensive??? They guarantee to be cheaper and if you compare their tariffs for all services, they are......simple!  I had been a loyal customer to larger suppliers such as BT and British Gas forever: However, in recent years, every time I had an issue, such as intermittent broadband or high gas bills, no one in their customer services could explain why: in fact I always went round in circles and spent hours, literally, on the phone to no avail.  I still had the problems when I transferred to UW but guess what.....they sorted every query effeciently and effectively.  An engineer was sent to my home to repair the external fault that BT claimed didn't exist on my phone line and lower bills for gas and electricity have proved that the increasing bills were down to my supplier.  I have found customer services to be polite and helpful.    I understand that some people will never be happy with UW: my parents aren't for example, but then they have given countless wrong readings for gas and electricity and have ordered the wrong mobile phone tariff despite the advise of their distributor.  Maybe those who are unhappy should look closer to home???
1947|We went with utility warehouse through a friend told us it was cheep, Boy was he wrong we had internet and phone and electric we ended up with massive bills. After 12 months we tried to cancel but still they sent bills that was two years ago and yes still paying 1600 pound off to this day STAY AWAY FROM THEM ROB DOGS 
1948|WHAT a FANTASTIC company! I have several properties & have put ALL of them with utility warehouse, WHY wouldnt i? Great customer service, SAVING loadsa money every mth & even reduces my accountancy bill as i just take in 12 bills per property NO piles of reciepts & bills to go thru! BUT what i really liked is what they are doing with big buisness, they wont give ANY discounts to big business.  EVERYONE pays the same which means I AM NOT PAYING 4 BIG BUSINESS unlike other companies out there, giveing big corperations HUGE discounts that YOU & I pay for. Was extremely worried about changing broadband & was happy with last provider, BUT decided to give it a go & guess what? simple & much faster than old supplier which actually surprised me AND i get free tech support.      
1949|Their help is not existance.  I have tried to contact them by phone because out of the blue I lost the internet and my email service so could not contact them by these means.  The technical number you have to ring was stated to be not available at the moment. I rang them on different days and times and still  not available.  I then rang them on their customer services number and this was automated.  It eventual told me it was going to connect me to their technical department.  Like hell, after 15 minutes hanging on I gave up.  Decided to write a message to their chief executive Mr Charles Wigoder that this 76 year old was not a happy cookie and asked him to help me out.  Not a reply.  What a service.  This was after a similiar incident when they knocked my email service out of order and still no help or reply. DONT EVER GO TO UTILITY WAREHOUSE FOR WHAT I HAVE AT THE MOMENT.  INTERNET, PHONE.  THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW. What more can this pensioner do but try my best to persuede potential customers to view whether it would be wise to go to this company.  DONT, DONT DONT. Syd Spence 3rd July 2010
1950|NOTHING BUT PRAISE!  I have been with Utility Warehouse now for 2 years and have nothing but praise for them. They were really helpful when I transferred my broadband to them and I have had no problems with it whatsoever - much better than Talk Talk, my previous provider. Being able to supply monthly meter readings on line is also really useful. Their customer services have been fantastic on the odd occasion I have needed to contact them. Having my gas & electric with them also gives me free landline calls. Big savings all round.
1951|iI have been with utility warehouse since the end of 2009, moved into an old house which had been empty for two years and it needed alot of work. To cut along story short had used very little gas as the new heating system was fitted in the last month of 2009, the gas meter was taken out and replaced as it was rusted and leaking badly...then got a gas bill from utility warehouse for over GBP2000 pound. have had many conversations with thier customer services and been bluffed off by them every time, now i have recived a final demand and court action! these people dont listen and are not interested in what i have to say,, am i really expected to pay for gas that leaked from a meter that had not been serviced or looked in god knows how long and the only reason it is replaced is because of a major leak! worst case scenario could have been an explosion.  So monday i will be on the phone again to deaf ears! i will follow this review up and let you all know what happens next  Regards a very unhappy customer
1952|Useless in my own experience. Maybe I just got unlucky but I wouldnt go near them again.
1953|Do not use this company period!
1954|I have been with utility warehouse for a month now and chose the broadband and phone package for GBP19.99. i chose to have the normal router and not the wireless one and i would have chosen the wireless one if i had known the beneifts. dont get me wrong i am still extremely happy with the service and product i am getting now but if anyone else decides to go with utility warehouse i would highly reccommend the wireless package as you have alot more access around your home rather than being restricted to one area with the fixed normal router.
1955|DREADFUL COMPANY DO NOT USE THEM!!!   Customer services is the worst I have ever known. Rude, inefficient, useless, expensive fuel!  On contacting the company to complain about the service no reply was given, a further email was sent and still waiting a reply over a month later!  They also took a direct debit from my account without permission which I see has happened to others also.  
1956|Avoid this company at any cost. The internet is really bad you always lose connection and some how viruses seem to get onto you PC or laptop. There is no internet security like the other Internet providers. My PC and my Laptop have been wiped due to the Internet. The Technical support is not even 24 hours so there is no support. Its open at stupid hours like 8am to 8pm mon-fri and foregt even ringing them in the weekend because they are not open. 
1957|Sold the house and left the country in November, informing UW a good month in advance. As instructed, gave them a meter reading the last day we were in the house (which was a week before the new owners took possession) and eventually got an email saying my statement was ready, but they'd closed my account so I wasn't able to login to the website to see it. By the end of December they'd prepared my final statement, they eventually emailed me the statement, after I told them I couldn't login. On the statement was an actual reading for the day the new owners took possession - I was due a big refund on gas and owed a little on electricity, and in January the refund was paid into my account. Just been emailed a letter they sent demanding a payment which was due on April 30th (Its now June). Along with the demand letter are statements with meter readings. There were two meter readings for electricity and two for gas, and they were all taken on the same day. The highest reading for both was less than the reading on my final statement, so surely they owe me money?!? Utterly useless.
1958|"Absolutely brilliant. Customer service is great unlike other Utility companies. Its easy to understand your bill and there is never any of this ""british Gas talk"" smoke and mirror rubbish where they confuse you and prentend its a good deal only to hike the prices or tie you in to a fixed which becomes extortion. I basically left BT because they conned me into a fixed contract that was ridiculously expensive - you know the rolling contract where they say you dont have to do anything until x date, and bang its too late. So I was delighted to now have a decent company charge me the best and most competitive rates. The Internet and phone is GBP19.99 free calls anytime in the UK and free calls to Top 10 global destinations (landline) Broadcall is the nanem, its awesome."
1959|"Have been with now for 18 months. Have no complaints at all regarding gas and electric, but avoid their internet service AT ALL COSTS! Their ""up to 8Meg"" is tosh! You will get 2.4Meg, but if you want to download anything it will be restricted. I get better speeds on my T mobile dongle! Am moving house in a couple of months so will see if other reviewers problems are encountered. I will still use them for gas and electric, but I think even TalkTalk would be better than them for the internet service."
1960|I have been with utilty warehouse for over a year now and have saved loads on our gas,elec Internet and phone. Uk call centres and very efficient. n good to have one payment for everything.No regrets in switching. Very happy customer 
1961|Worst company ever. Had an agreement to pay quarterly. Was told to ignore all bills until 3 months was up then call with meter reading. Did this and then recieved letter from debt collection agency telling me that I owed lots of money to them.  They are one of the wort companies I have ever dealt with. DO NOT GO WITH THEM! You have been warned
1962|I've now been a customer for 12 months and am really pleased with them.  I love the single bill because it makes my life much easier and on my last bill I had GBP35 cashback which I wouldn't have had if I didn't have their cashback card.  Would I recommend them?  Most definately YES
1963|Having been with Utility Warehouse for 5 months now and I find their service to be shockingly bad. We were paying around GBP60 a month for gas & electricity in 1 2 bed flat, we moved to UW and our 1st estimate was GBP300, followed by 3 more to the same value. When we rang to sort this we were just fobbed off! We then got told we could not leave because the bill was outstanding! there solution today was to only charge us GBP87 a month!!! How is that a solution?? This was after they had taken GBP180 from my bank even though I had not authosired a DD to be taken! this company is a joke 
1964|AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! NEVER USE!!!! You'll end up paying for something you don't get and yet you can't shake them off- they keep sending you letters saying you owe them more and more money although you're not actually being provided with a service!! They are that bad that we would rather pay double to British gas or someone else!! ONLY REASON THEY GOT 1 STAR WAS BECAUSE THE COMPUTER WOULDN'T TAKE LESS!!!
1965|This company has been fantastic - We have saved so much money!  Having it all on one monthly bill has been great. We have not got in arrears with our energy bill once instead of receiving a huge bill at the year from previous suppliers. We can call our friends and family whenever we want to and it cost less than being with BT who we paid more to and had no free calls! We can call our friends in France, Canada and Australia at no extra cost. What we saved in a year paid for one of us to go abroad on holiday(How cool is that!) I would highly recommend this company to anyone.  When we joined as a customer we would have liked an idea of exactly how much our energy bills would have been but a friend who has recently joined said she received an energy quotation before she joined. We have also made great savings using their mobile service and the fantastic Cash back card.  We joined via this site www.bestutilityplayer.co.uk 
1966|AWEFUL COMPANY - AVOID  I completely agree with other reviews in that this company are disorganised and ridiculously overpriced. I moved into a semi detached property at the end of November and have paid well over GBP1000 for gas and electricity. My last gas bill for 24 days was GBP350. There is only two of us living in the house, so our usage isn't high (we are out all day and away alot of weekends), our house is also thoroughly insulated (including outside wall) and we only had the heating on for 2 hours in the winter (we have wood fires). I've been trying to get hold of the company on numerous occasions since moving into the house with no joy (I've been on hold for over 10 minutes a couple of times and just given up). I emailed a complaint through to them which has been unanswered. I also had no explaination about their payment terms and therefore received hefty surcharges without knowing payment was due and their payment terms are dreadful for someone who works (Their phone line is 9am to 5.30am...I've only ever sent a cheque therefore which doesnt help with the surcharge situation)  I would NOT reccommend this company.
1967|I have been a customer for a little less than a year now and have found it to be an excellent experience.  I saved approx. GBP400 on my phone and broadband (which was with BT prior) and GBP300 on cashback card savings. I am also now at the end of the year GBP100 in credit for my gas and electricity.  My total bill for gas / electric / phone and broadband per month is a little over GBP100 and it was approx. GBP150 prior.  I would say that in order to make the most savings you must utilise all the benefits available to you.  I think my cashback card is the best thing ever and it makes you realise just how much you do spend on everyday items..  I would not change even if you paid me.  It is invaluable having the bills altogether and monthly.  I feel sorry for the people that have had problems.  The person that sold me my package kept in contact with us every step of the way through the switching process and gives us phone calls from time to time - now that is service!!!
1968|UTILITY WAREHOUSE ARE AWFUL!!! They are the most unprofessional, unorganised company I have ever, ever dealt with. They are trying to charge us over GBP400 for ONE MONTH when we didn't even live in the house. This has now been going on for TWO YEARS and we have had debt collection agencies threatening to come and take away our possessions to pay the bill. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS - do not be fooled by them. This is genuine feedback. Not ONE PERSON that we have spoken to has actually taken control of this situation or offered us any explanation as to how we can owe so much money. I would never, never, never recommend Utility Warehouse to anyone. 
1969|I switched to Utility Warehouse recently and found that my old supplier had provided UW with duff info about my elec meter number (unique to each meter) and the reading.  UW have billed me a fair amount while the prob is being sorted by them - guy comes wednesday to verify meter number & reading.  Which? & The Times reckon this is a good company and that has been my experience; cust service has been nothing but helpful & polite.  As for being a pyramid company - they are NOT!  Pryamid selling is illegal.  They seem to operate like many companies out there (Kleeneze, Betterware, etc).  How else will they build up their customer base?
1970|I have had good experiances with Utility Warehouse, weer saving GBP30 a month with the cashback card on food and petrol, and saved aprox GBP600 by changing our utilities. Some of the other comments are hard to believe as the company has won awards from WHICH magazine and although they dont bing you into a contract 94% of their customers stay with them, so I guess us customers are happy customers, the negative stuff ive seen written here is not my or my friends experiance AT ALL some of whome have been customers for the passed 4 years. I think if Im going to pay attention to anyone it would be my friends who have first hand experiance as customers and WHICH im not sure about nameless people? 
1971|"WARNING STAY AWAY!  there are a lot of positive comments on the web about UW, this is because its a sales scam. ive seen first hand what mess they leave there customers in. the company works on a pyramid system, so after joe bloggs has paid his GBP199 joining fee he then try's to sell all the products to you ""saying he works for UW"". they earn about GBP20 for broadband sales, GBP9 for each gas contract ect ect, whilst also trying to make more people join ""his team"" (so he gets more money)   i run my own business which i will not name (the last thing i want is my company name next to UW) and to date heard 3 business customers and many residential horror story's "
1972|you only have to mention that you're with utility warehouse to any other utility canvasser, and they back off because they know you're with the cheapest. I've been with them for about 7 years, and wouldn't change at present.
1973|Good customer service. Great savings using cashcard. Easy to join and use the facilities
1974|Fantastic savings, wonderful customer support and definitely the best internet provider I have experienced.     I am an IT trainer and deal with many providers and Utility Warehouse's technical support is the best.    
1975|easily the worst internet provider ever, they say they have cheap bills but they dont i had to pay over 180 pound for 3 months phone calls. they expect you to send everything back that they sent you and if you dont you get charged 12 pound, well i think you should come and pick it up yourself and dont be so lazy you want the stuff back so you can come collect it. there support team cant speak a word of english there rude, cheeky, tell you the wrong information they tell you what you already know. i would reccomend bt homehub broadband far better than this.
1976|I'm amazed at the savings !! What most people don't get is that you should be on all the services and do all your shopping with the cash back card. If you do this the savings are massive.  Customer service is brilliant. Put them up against the likes of BT and Utility Warehouse slaughters them.   I have recommended to ALL my friends and relatives. Every one of them are over the moon.   I don't usually give testimonials but I just had to write about this...  Terry
1977|I am delighted with all the savings I am making with Utility Warehouse services.  This week I received a letter with another reduction in energy price of 8%, while my friend's charges with my old company just went up again!I am recommending this to all my friends and family, and many have joined and are really happy. It was important to me to know that this business won the Financial Times business of the year award.
1978|I have been a Utility Warehouse customer for over 18 months and many of my friends are also customers. We have all saved a fortune compared to other companies and using Utility Warehouse cashback card (a clever pre paid top up card) I save GBP50-GBP60 per month extra just by doing my normal shopping and getting my petrol.  The customer services department are excellent - how wonderful to talk to them in London and I've never had to wait more than 30 seconds for my call to be answered by a friendly and helpful member of staff.  I would highly recommend this company. Give them a go - I signed up becuase there is no contract so I knew I could cancel if I wasnt happy. 
1979|Excellent company, with very competitive prices and all on one bill!!!! I send my reading in on the last day of the month and only ever pay for the gas/electric I use. Received the bill on the 14th each month, pay by direct debit on the last working day. No other utility company pay me to shop, gives me money off by way of shopping with the cashback card and recommending my family and friends.  Ive just heard they have launched a compare shopping site which we can use the cashback card on, to save evan more money.  What more do people want.
1980|what a rip off! my advice is dont switch to these, there are better deals on the web. your bills just go higher and higher no satisfaction with customer service centre just fobbed off every time stay well clear really poor service,
1981|Customer services only open 9-5.30,  usually 10 minute wait before answering calls, number is 0845 so not part of free calls.  Put on basic tariff then not reviewed so you end up paying over the odds.  Customer services when you do get through promise a return call but don't make it.  When you eventually opt to leave they keep your money for a few months and carry on taking it from your direct debit even though the automated system says you've left.  If this is the service you want then look no further - The Utility Warehouse do all this regularly.
1982|where do i start. the 0844 number that is the only way to speak to someone is ridculus. if your a student like my self land line numbers are expensive and unessary when your only in a place for 10months, and their 0844 number costs a fortune on any mobile network. when you finaly get through to someone after 8- 20 minutes of waiting for no apparent reason the person on the other end of the line has the cheek to give you an attitude. exellent customer service ! im yet to be in recipt of this experience with this company. ive been out of my property nearly a month now and im still waiting for my final electric bill which im told only get sent out on one day of the month. that was 3weeks ago and im currently waiting for the bill after asking for it 5times now. try to complain ? your joking you just get some idiot saying there sorry i feel that way . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. IF YOU CHOOSE TO IGNORE THIS COMMENT ITS YOUR OWN STUPID FAULT WHEN IT ALL GOES WRONG. 
1983|Utility Warehouse is great. We pay less than we used to for international phone calls, phone gas and electricity. The cashback card helps with that a great deal. Even in our first month by switching supermarket we saved GBP30 on the bill(we only had the card 3 weeks). The rise in petrol prices stings less as we get 5p off in the pound! Customer services are great too. Much better than BT. No long menus and you can deal with all your questions in one place! If they ever get 50MB broadband i would not hesitste to switch!
1984|I have been a customer for just over a year.  I have nothing put positives for this company. The services are very good and the customer service is second to none.   The biggest plus point for me is the membership benefits.   My husband was made redundant at christmas and since we have had our GBP120 bill paid each month, all for GBP3 per month.   This has been a massive relief to me and my family, I dont know how we would have managed without it.  My husband is still looking for work, so hopefully he will have found something by June when the time the redundancy cover comes to an end.  As far as Im aware no other company provides this.    In conclusion I would have no hesitation in recomending to my friends and family to Utility Warehouse.    
1985|Since I have been with UWDC I havent had any problems in fact I found their service is exceptional and outstanding compare to others.  The bills are cheaper, you recommend someone, you get 2% off your bills, they have lot on offer other then just Gas and Electricity.  I think most of the people who says foul stuff about the Utility Warehouse are either the employees of Britsh gas or EDF or any other energy provider or simply one of those unfortunate people with bad experience.  You have to stay with them for some time, at least a year to see the real benefit as they estimate your bill on annual basis.  I would give them 10 out of 10 in terms of services, value for money and most of all there are many exciting schemes that are very interesting and fascinating. 
1986|The day that I switched gas.electric and telecom services to Utility Warehouse I made the biggest mistake of my life.  Now months after closing down my accounts they refuse to return funds owed to me and I am having to rely on the ombudsman to try to obtain my refund.  If you want a nightmare experience then use this company.  Slow broadband and a hate relationship with its customers.  Steer clear at all costs. 
1987|I cannot believe how good this service is which is mainly a reflection of the expectation i have from experience of such poor service in the past. The biggest benefit comes from bundling energy, telecoms and internet onto one bill which really simplifies household budgeting. The ability to reduce bills by recommending new customers on an on going basis and discounts from expenditure with partners really does empower and reward me as a consumer. Finally when i call the company for help I get great service and quick solutions. Everything we expect from a company who we pay for service, excellent.  Bill
1988|I have been a customer since sep09 and have seen a definate reduction in my gas and electricity bills, I like the fact my cashback card reduces my bill just by shopping and petrol. My March 2010 bill was GBP19.50. I like best that this is on one bill and I can see and control the bill monthly so no more massive shocks with crazy estimated bills or unreasable budget plans. Service is fine-I email them to change my payment amount or payment date and they email me back...simple. I intend to switch my phone and broadband when i am out of contract with Tiscali (now if you want to experience poor service try those clowns).
1989|It's a reality that most of the people that leave review are those that for one reason or the other had a problem with their supplier. Utility Warehouse are the cheapest I've seen so far. All my bills comes to under GBP60 for March. With my discount card I will be paying less than GBP50 next month. UW are working on getting better and they are doing a good job of it. Obviously, if they slip I will be the first to exit. Hopefully, they will keep up the good customer service and value for money.
1990|Absoloutley brilliant, very easy to switch, very quick, great savings especially if you stay with them for 12 months and even bigger savings if you utilise their other services like, broadcall (broadband/telephone), and fantastic savings if you use their cashback card which saves me ( and others) approx 35% extra on our bills every month, plus, I get free phone calls as well.  This is brilliant, I would highly recommend to everyone even business's  Well done utilty warehouse - 1 great deal after another, and another, and another etc, etc etc.......  I would award them 6 stars if there was 6 stars available.  Many thanks
1991|Hi there,  UW's customer service is appalling. I was with them for 10 months for broadband and phone but spent 7 months of that time trying to get them to enable my phone and broadband to work at the same time. If the phone rang it would cut off the internet, which was damned annoying if you were in the middle of a transaction. The phone itself worked but you could hardly hear a word your caller said due to intermittent interferance. UW spend an hour on the phone trying to solve the problem, with me paying the call bill on my mobile remember, as my phone wasn't working. They sent me a new filter. When this didn't work and I rang again, I was transfered about for another hour before being told ' I've no idea what the problem is'!!! So I thought I'd try emailling - to cut a long story short, emails went back and forth, the problem wasn't solved, yet they were still charging me for a service I couldn't use.  I've since switched suppliers and, lo & behold, my phone AND my internet work perfectly. My final bill, which bear in mind was for a whole month where neither my phone nor my internet were connected at all was GBP94!!!!! Therefore I would advise everybody to steer clear of UW.
1992|Hi All,  UW say that they are cheaper than the mainstream suppliers, so I checked this out using recent meter readings I have taken and data from my bill. Currently I have spent GBP2200 annually on Gas and Electric bill with UW I will save GBP600 going to EDF i.e. 27% saving!!.  Do it through Sainsburys, it's the same deal but you get the extra Nectar points 3000 or so.  Well worth the effort in changing.  I have innitiated this with EDF but they advise it could take up to 6 or 8 weeks to cocmplete.  I will be pushing this hard to to shorten the remaing time with UW. 
1993|I am in thr process of leaving UW.  Their customer service is ameteurish.  II was with UW and had electricity, gas and Broadcall (internet and calls bundle)but decided to move my gas and electricity about 3 months ago and provided a final reading as I found EDF to be much cheaper.   2 months later, I receive a final bill for about GBP1000!  We rang up, gave the final reading again and were told to ignore the bill as we would get another one.  We did this, but earlier this month got a reminder dated 8 days earlier saying that if we did not pay the GBP1000 within 7 days that our phone would be cut off!  Generally, they are very keen to take your business, but when it comes to solving problems they are rubbish.  By comparison, EDF (who I have moved my energy to) bent over backwwards to help sort out the final bill problems.  If you have Broadcall, you cannot cancel just the Broadband element without cancelling the whole phone service, which means you may have to pay BT GBP125 to reconnect unless you manage the process carefully.
1994|Whatever you do, don't sign up with these idiots. Their customer service is appaling, they pick random numbers for estimates and bleed you dry if you let them. If you want to make any changes,have a problem or need to do anything other than let them take huge amounts from your account by direct debit they make it as hard as possible... To keep their numbers looking good, they make it impossible to get an 'official' complaint reference number and they refuse to act on information provided by Trading Standards. They tell lies about how they calculate bills and pass the buck on everything.  Bottom line - do yourself a favour and go elsewhere.
1995|I've been a Club member since September 09 and have been very impressed with all 'switch-over' of my utility services. My previous energy supplier charged me GBP98 p/mth (dual fuel) I now pay with Utility Warehouse GBP87 p/mth - SAVING straight away. On top of that the 5% CASHBACK CARD is FANTASTIC - everyday shopping at partner stores gives me 5% cashback which is credited off my utility bill. Since Oct 09 I have reduced my bill further by GBP178 - No other energy supplier can do that! No other energy supplier can provide me with telecoms, all one one monthly bill. No other energy supplier gives me a discount for recommending friends. I just wish I had heard of Utility Warehouse Discount Club before.
1996|Utility Warehouse are the best I have been with most other suppliers my bill are easy to understand and I can save money l can even make money as a distributor just check it out with which consumer who have given utility warehouse best buys they must be the best
1997|"I think Utility Warehouse are the bees knees! They are always so polite when you ring their customer service number. Their bills are so easy to read and I save a fortune (often over 50% of my monthly bill) but using their cashback card. Well done Utility Warehouse, I am a very satisfied customer and its no wonder you are time and time again getting ""Best Buy"" reviews in the independent consumer Which? Magazine. "
1998|We have heard about U-Switch and how they get you to swap services around to try and save you money. STOP PRESS ... I Have found a 'Piggin Brilliant' solution THAT WILL SAVE YOU MONEY and THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE anyone could ask for. Seriously... I have found U.W. an incredible service, saved GBP149 since September last year, had my call answered in less than 15 seconds, got a 5% cash back card and saved money on all my shopping and fuel and...... I expect to save a wopping GBP600 this year on all my household bills!!!  (Average cost to heat, light, energise and make calls from my tower, per year: GBP1,200)  Thats not all..... tell all your friends and family about it and you'll receive even further reductions off your bill!!!  I'm absolutely thrilled and quids in with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club. Did I also mention that you can win a 'Piggin' Mini?  Merlins Beard...   M Marshall
1999|"Utility Warehouse? Never again! Terrible ""customer service"".  We have been with them for 5 months with a combined service for phone/internet/gas and electricity. Unfortunately we missed January's direct debit payment (due to changeover of bank account) on the 31st of Jan.  They did not write to us or warn us in anyway that the payment had been missed and the first we knew was on the 10th February we realised we had no internet or phone line. I contacted them and paid immediately and was told we would be reconnected within 2 hours. Today is the 15th and we have only just been reconnected despite daily phone calls to them with no straight answer as to why their service is so shoddy.  So yes, they are cheap but here you get what you pay for! If you want to be disconnected within ONE WEEK(!) of missing a payment go for it! If you want a battle to be reconnected with no one prepared to take ownership of your problem- go for it! We have decided to cancel our contract and go to a more professional company that knows how to deliver customer care.  Shame on you, utility warehouse. "
2000|As a customer for 5 years of utility warehouse I have recently left because they are no longer competitive on price and have dropped their customer service standards immensely.  When I contacted them to change tariffs due to having a new oil boiler installed they stated I had been on the wrong electric tariff for years and I should have been paying around GBP100 a year less, this apparently was my own fault as I didn't check the newer dealds available and their monitoring of your account is just to ensure they get paid.  I have been kept on hold for up to 30 mins and promised return calls have never been made.  I am now in process of switching and have been given a predicted saving of GBP300 per year with my new supplier.
2001|My husband and switched to utility warehouse in nov09, we thought we were doing ourselves a favour, how wrong we were.  Firstly when our bill came i had to ring them to ask if i  could change the direct debit date, i was then told that they only had one date and that was the middle of the month. I said well thats no good as no-one gets paid in the middle of the month. After that I said we would pay with the debit card and switch to another supplier. Since this i paid two bills , i had an outstanding balance letter with payment details attached, after querying this amount i was spoken to like dirt, only to find the bill is actually higher than the letter said. After speaking to my new supplier , even they think its wrong and are prepared to look into the matter for us. I think they,re rubbish and wish i,d never heard of them.
2002|"The problem is when you are selling any types for Goods or Services is that you will get some unsatisfied customers no matter how hard you try to please them.  Its just human nature.  Sadly your more likely to hear the negative's of a person's dealings with a company rather than any positive benefits. Especially these days when you can ""vent your spleen"" online to release your frustrations or anger.   In the early days, 1998 when I first started using the internet, I was very appreciative of this ability by the masses to share their experiences with fellow consumers without fear of recrimination. Many a time I have found what I thought was a Great Service or an Absolute bargain only to be put off completely, after googleing for reviews of the product or the company. The fact that I am by nature slightly cynical and admittedly skeptical didnt help.  Thankfully, over years I have definately learnt to treat many reviews with a sense of balance. I could go into greath depth here but will spare you my boring analysis. Save to say for a company like Utility Warehouse Discount Club some consumers will greatly benefit & others will not. It will boil down to the individual or the family who are trying to cut down on their bills as a whole.  If you are organised, have the time and inclination to shop around and use price comparison sites and voucher codes then dont bother. If you are too busy, have a heavy work schedule, bogged down with work and kids and wouldnt have a clue what you're being charged for any given utility and especially if you have been with the same utility company longer than you can remember then these guys could be good for you. ShoQat Badat Sho"
2003|Really peeved as because you buy from a 'distributor' you feel you have a direct contact. However, the distributors are only interesting in recruiting other distributors and not in their customers. I ended up paying and EXTRA GBP20 per month from what I had been paying before.   Their package benefits state no continual contract (i.e. not signed up for 12/18 months) however their is a sly disconnection fee payable if you leave them!!! HAving spoken to other distributors they are apparently meant to give a cost review although this is not an obligation.
2004|I have been with UWH a few months and I think it is great that I can save money and get cash back for recomendations brilliant Idea and excellant customer service hope they keep it up Voted 5 star rating wich magazine Feb 2010 I can see why
2005|I am a customer of UW and have made huge savings against my previous suppliers.  I am now a distributor, its a great opporunity to show others how to save money and in return you earn an extra income to.  If you r interested in becoming a distributor or a customer please visit www.925neveragain.com
2006|I HAVE BEEN WITH UW FOR 9 MONTHS NOW, CAN HONESTLY SAY ITS THE VERY BEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE. AFTER YEARS WITH ONE OF THE BIG 6 AND THIS TIME LAST YEAR I WAS PAYING GBP390.00 PER MONTH DD. FOR 7 MONTHS THEY THEN WANTED TO PUT IT UP TO GBP410.00 PER MONTH ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH, I SAID TO THEM WHY DON'T I SEND YOU MY BANK CARD AND YOU CAN TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF MY BANK ACC WHEN YOU WANT AS YOU SEEM TO THINK MY BANK ACC IS YOUR BANK ACC. WHEN I GAVE MY FINAL READINGS FOR GAS & ELEC THEY THEN SAID I STILL OWED THEM NEARLY A GBP1,000.00. STILL IN DISPUT WITH THEM AS I THINK THEY OWE ME MONEY NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. I LIVE WITH MY DAUGHTER IN A 4 BED HOUSE NOT BUCKINGHAM PALACE!!! I NOW ONLY PAY FOR WHAT I USE EACH MONTH BY E-MAILING MY METRE READINGS EACH MONTH. EASY, ALSO CHEAPER THAN MY LAST SUPPLIER + THE BILLS ARE SO EASY TO READ. I HAVE 4 SERVICES WITH THEM & SAVING ON AVERAGE GBP200 PER MONTH. I HAVE RECOMMENDED THEM TO MY FAMILY & FRIENDS ITS NOT BEEN HARD AS I ALWAYS SHOW THEM MY BILLS FROM MY PREVIOUS SUPPLIER NO OTHER UTILITY SUPPLIER BILLS YOU EVERY MONTH. THEY ARE FANTASTIC I HAVE PEACE OF MIND NOW,KNOWING I WON'T BE HAVING ANY MORE BIG BILLS.            I FEEL I'AM NOW IN CHARGE.  
2007|If you want a peace of mind and want to enjoy the warmth and the light of your home carefree, do not choose them. The customer service is poor, unorganised, dey do not know what they doing. I have made a mistake signig up for them. Maybe they cheap but I rather pay a little bit more...
2008|Not really the cost of UW that bothers me (quite frankly I have no idea whether they are expensive or not). BUT when I have tried to pay my bill for over 7 months and still they keep sending demands after their appalling system fails again, the time has come for broadcast.  If you like sitting on hold paying an expensive 0844 number for over an hour (yes an hour on hold) you get annoyed. You want to see someone boiled in oil. Sorry that's unfair. You want to see all the clowns making buckets of cash out of their customer's suffering boiled in oil and get to have a sharp stick to prod them with.  Shocking level of customer service, avoid and shun.
2009|I have been with the Utility Warehouse for over 1 yr. The bills are so low. with British Gas we were charged GBP370 per quarter for gas only for a 3 bed terraced. With Utility Warehouse we pay GBP135 per quater for same winter period.  The cashback card is excellent 5% off my bill by going shopping! Also 2% off my bill for life for every new customer I reccommend!  Does any other company do these sort of discounts?????
2010|I have just become a distributor for UWDC. The training is good, the motivational meetings are good and the possibility of getting your buy in money back is good too. The customer service is fast and efficient. I rekon it is agood company to be involved with, the best of it's kind out there. i hope for great things to come! The cash back is a definite plus. I am a bit reticent about selling, or feel rather uncomfortable about it but I will just have to get over myself! 
2011|I found this review of Utility Warehouse very helpful and would like to expand because I am currently experiencing serious problems and can see that this company is ill equipped to deal with legitimate complaints, as rather than do this they have gone ahead and issued me with the most threatening final demand received today, broadcasting Final Demand in big red letters to all and sundry on the envelope - following my clear and reasonable complaint by phone and in writing that they have been overestimating my energy bills and over-debiting my bank account - due to their failure to accept real readings provided to them by me by phone, online and by email - this followed my realisation that they had not taken a final reading (in fact found out they had never taken a reading in 3 years) from previous tenants and regularly say they have when recruiting new customers and giving them icorrect estimates of what they will be paying per month - which has caused great trouble with my bills being wildly incorrect estimates of gas and particularly electricity, thereby overcharging monthly direct debits and not responding accordingly when challenged. Rather than assess my energy usage as promised on my real, recent and current readings, I have today received the most threatening final demand letter which ignores existence of recent calls and correspondence promising to put right the problem - instead repeating demand in last monthly bill for nearly 400 hundred pounds (this is a low energy 1 bed flat), to be paid in 7 days, claiming they have now cut off my telephoney services (they have not) - letter outlines many distressing threats which do not consitute consumer rights and does not refer me to any complaints procedure: they will pass me to debt collection agency if not pay in 7 days of date of letter (in effect leaving me 1 day to pay as letter received 6 days after date of letter), otherwise will issue a warrant to enter premises to install pre-pay meters, increasing cost of my energy, add my name to debt register, in addition I pay for any equipment I have received like modems. routers  etc if not returned in 7 days, I will pay for their costs to obtain warrant and install pre-pay meters stating this can often be double the amount I have to pay (double what amount I wonder?), I will pay for all other costs Utility warehouse incur to recover debt eg arranging for bailiffs to visit in order to remove possessions; interest to be paid on debt until it has been repaid in full - and final insult for a company claiming you have no contract ties with them - I will not be able to switch to another energy supplier until the money I owe UW, together with all their debt collection costs, have been paid in full. Never mind about any reference to legitimate dispute, complaint, consumer rights, help to resolve matter before any of this might happen - no, Credit Controller wants you to just pay up now or face these nasty consequences. Desperately upset that I accepted a recommendation to use Utility Warehouse in order to keep household bills easy and in one place. They have abused my trust - holding telephoney sevices to ransom (expect these to be cut off any minute) while disputing energy bills - and are not fit for current consumer climate or debt consideration processes in my sad experience. Beware    
2012|The Utility Warehouse is the worst utility supplier I have ever used,, big mistake switching to them. It took 2 weeks to repair my phone line because Utility Warehouse told BT that their own line test confirmed the fault to be within my premises which I would have to pay for.I had ran my own tests which confirmed the fault to be outside of my house but Utility Warehouse wouldn't pass the repair to BT until I agreed to pay for the repair. Eventually I Contacted BT myself who came round at their own expense amd found the fault in the road. I spent approx GBP10 hanging on the Utility Warehouse premium rate customer service phone number 0844 and 3 hours away from work attending the repair which was outside. Utility Warehouse have credited my bill with GBP1.50. Since then I've checked their gas and electric tariffs which are now one of the most expensive you can get so it's time to change which is a shame because the local agent is a good guy. 
2013|All is Well i Would recommend this company to friend and family and am doing so as this company and the only company that do One bill for all your services, and best of all A Cashback Card ( it pay's me to Shop!!!!)Good customer service Excellant  
2014|UTILITY WAREHOUSE IS A BRILLANT, FABULOUS AND FANTASTIC COMPANY...!!! I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE...!!!
2015|I have been with Utility Warehouse for Gas, Electricity, Phone and Broadband since January 2009.  I wish I'd heard about them sooner. The customer service is second to none with a London based call centre. I am extremely pleased with the prices I pay and I enjoy further discounts on my monthly bill via their Cashback card. Overall I'm very happy indeed.
2016|great customer service, great value,real bill shrinking potential
2017|We would and have recommended the utilities warehouse to our friends and family, after experiencing other companies poor customer service where my partner has been left in tears after an hour and 20 mins, it's refreshing to speak to someone in the UK on the occasions we've had to call their customer service centre, not only that we've had the phone answered in as little as 3 seconds! we also get around GBP30 - GBP40 off of our bill every month with the card.
2018|Recently become a customer and very pleased with their service my bills are cheaper and customer service is fab would definately recommend
2019|I got onto this website cos i was looking at home delivery companies. I saw how bad the one particular company in question was, but then looked at others and noticed how equally rubbish they were too! So I checked out my energy company too. Everyone wants a good moan on there. check them out!!! I've been with utility warehouse for about 2 1/2 years and my personal experiences have been easy going. I pay a good price for my electric and gas, phone and b'band, and i've got a good mobile deal from them. I get money knocked off my bill from when I get petrol and groceries with a 5% discount card. I reckon the card shrinks my bill by about GBP40 a month on average. Anyway, I digress. Just looked at other energy companies and most of them are one star, so I'm glad these guys aren't equally rubbish with them.
2020|i cant beleive some of the negative comments, have used them for 1 year now, they answer any query very quickly and sort it out, bills are down in size, cashback card can save a small fortune. You just need to check your monthly energy usage and make sure your budget payments meet the usage it aint rocket science. broadband is tons faster as well. brilliant.
2021|" I was told recently by someone in the energy business that there is only about GBP35 difference between ALL the energy-providing companies.  The reason I'm with Utility W. is because I got my first cellphone from them about 10 yrs ago and have stayed with them.  Also changed my Gas to them as well.  The only negative comment I would make is:  their mobile phone dept seems to be full of jumped-up young men who think they know it all.  When you describe the message that is appearing on your mobile phone, they say ""it can't be"". In other words, because I am female they think I dont know anything, but it is they who fall very short so their technical bods are not very good at all.  If a problem is not in their Training Manual, then the customer is making it up."
2022|AVOID AT ALL COSTS- Utility Warehouse has the most appalling customer service we have ever encountered and should be put out of business for the way they charge a recurring membership fee only to deliberately mislead and overcharge consumers then ignore their complaints.  They claim they will put you on a suitable tariff once they determine your electricity usage, but for almost a year they quietly left us building a debt of hundreds of pounds by keeping us on a more expensive price plan even though we consistently provided our own meter readings. Then they have the cheek to deny all responsibility with bog standard responses, and to bill you for Late Payment fees when they are the ones delaying the process by not responding to our complaints!  It has been 3 months since we started the dispute and nothing has been addressed, and we foresee it eventually landing in Small Claims Court. We have wasted so much time, money and energy on this stupid company- emailing twice only to receive dismissive replies, sending a long letter to the CEO only to wait weeks before being told they never received it (and only after I called myself to find out), paying extra to re-post it by Recorded Delivery, tracking and confirming it was delivered, waiting another 3 weeks with no reply, and calling AGAIN only to be told they aren't sure what's happening and will call me back. That was 2 days ago and surprise surprise, nobody has phoned back.  Do not believe a word of their claims to be a Discount Club, they are nothing but con-job liars out to take advantage of people unaware of their consumer rights!
2023|"I have been with Utility WareHouse for several years and experienced no problems until September of this year with regard to internet broadband. Numerous problems occured with acessing internet and for several weeks I was without.  I made many phonecalls and sent fax to Michael Richards, Customer Service Manager but was not afforded the courtesey of a reply and when I phoned requesting to speak to the man personally was either told he was away on holiday or out!  However, I never did receive any internet connection altho I was paying for the service at the time!  I made the decision after several weeks and numerous phone calls thereafter to switch to another provider having informed Utility WareHouse of my intention to do so.  I received a letter from ""the man himself"" yes the elusive Michael Richards confirming he had received notification of my transfer to another company.  I settled my final account but hasten to add a month on I have received a further bill from Utility WareHouse even tho I no longer subscribe to them but am continually told that they will be sorting the matter out with their management.  I have contacted Trading Standards have advised me that they are in breach of their contract and they will be investigating the matter. taking it further and so stress the following...  PLEASE BE WARNED.  "
2024|iv been with them for just over a year.. iv had no end of problems very bad customer services.. first 6 months were great out of the blue i was sent a 900 bill. monthly bills are around 300 a month for gas and electricity i have a very small 3 bed house. i would never advise any 1 to join U W.as iv said no end of problems cant wait to leave them... 
2025|Been a customer of Utility Warehouse now for about 6 years and always been pleased with the service and the ease of use. It was a smooth transition to swap over my gas/elec/broadband and tel lines to them. Love fact that only get one bill each month and fact that having all in one place makes things a) so much cheaper and b) so much easioer to manage. Would highly recommend.  
2026|I am currently in the process of switching my gas, electricity phone & broadband over to Utility Warehouse. Up to press everything they have said is spot on & the change over has gone smoothly. I received my 1st statement & it is so easy to understand. I also think the Cashback card is great! I look forward to saving money with my Cashback card. Will keep you all posted on future comments... 
2027|I have been reading through these reviews as I have recently joined to become a distributor of utility warehouse. Seen many comments of people who are not at all happy with the customer service, I have spoke to them on numerous occasions and they not only answer the phone within 15 sec but they are all ways more than happy to help.   It does annoy me when there is a genuinely good company and people slate it.   Why dont you stick to bt or british gas then, The companies who tie you into 5 year contracts over the phone without you even knowing. Thats real customer service isn't it.   Its a standard 28 day rolling contract with utility warehouse. no ties you can cancel at anytime. Now would a company trying to rip you of do that I wonder.   Dont listen to the negative people they unfortunately for them will never be happy with what they got. If the services were free they would still find something to complain about.  Cheers anyway guys hope this helped.  any queries on becoming a member id be more than happy to help.   just email me at josephasmith@hotmail.co.uk
2028|UWCLUB is far the cheaper provider of provisions, its one monthly bill. No contract. and UK customer service......what more can i say..... and i disagree with some of the comments on this forum.....the first months bill could be a little higher as os pro rata...as anything would be.... and the cross over from other providers is a nightmare for any of them not one in particular..... shaz
2029|To all,  Firstly i am a distributor and a customer, over the last six months or so i have checked and re checked all sorts of sites chat rooms forums etc and i can see where people are coming from with the Utility Warehouse.  However Firstly remember all companies no matter how big or small make or have problems this is life no one is 100% perfect, and i sure there are people out there who know this.  Secondly The Utility Warehouse have a 90+% success rate compare that with all the other companies.  Thirdly if a distributor is telling you they are the cheapest etc then they are mis leading you, the company is set up to provide a clear and concise way of one single bill and if set up from the start can save you money but this you need to understand how it works correctly from the start.  All companies offer a saving this is business but how they do this is by clever manipulation of words and facts (remember they employe people to do this)  I agree do your research prior to switching but let me say this:  If the Utility were as bad or as poor as people say then just look at our credabilty and see if this can be compared to anyone else?  5 years in Which nagazine Twice Awarded Top for Business in Europe Regulated by Ofcom Ofgem A FTSE 250 company Awarded best for service and billing  Remember all companies go through changes and design Utility Warehouse have come a long way from its early days and have learnt from customers this is adaption and an understanding on how they can always improve.  Also remember if you like what you have and you recommend as a customer you receive a discount from your bill, who else does this?  Conclusion  All i see is companies consistantly trying new tricks gimmicks and ideas to WIN new customers!   And all i can say to this is The Utility Warehouse dont do this and dont need to.  My details are posted here as im not posting like others to hide behind a computer name  Regards  James  www.purplepigsavings.co.uk 
2030|Dont go anywhere near Utility Warehouse. Theyre customer srevice is appalling, a damned right digrace! Go with a more reputable company for any of your utilities. They have peeved me of no end!!!
2031|Please be careful with Utility warehouse.I agree everything does seem rosy for the first 12months until you get your annual review.An agent took away my utility bills had them studied and came back with an offer which was basically too good to turn down,electric and gas for 70pounds a month compared to the 100 pound I was paying.Now for shock,after 12 months I was informed that I was previously on a budget plan and was not paying enough to cover my actual  utility consumption.Consequently my gas and electric D/D was increased to GBP174 and GBP90 respectively (or would have been if I had not told them to sling their hook).Now I have had them chasing me for GBP1200 which they say I owe for the 12 months I was with them?YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,but please understand this is my opinion only yet I have heard similar horror stories on various forums
2032|Love this company!!!! broadband is good works well whatever the time, Gas and Electric is GBP 20 cheaper than my previous supplier and the cash back card is saving me another 25%. Altogether really chuffed couldnt recommend them enough.
2033|We love being with the Utility Warehouse! It has made a huge difference to us. Our bills are down to GBP55 per month for a 3 bed house and that includes our phone.  Our last supplier EON charged GBP160 per and month for the same period. It took us months to pay off a bill from EON that was GBP600! It is so good to know that we are now getting a fair deal and it's nice and easy to pay each month via a single bill. We also really enjoy using our cash back card which knocks GBP30 off our bill each month - no other supplier can compete with this surely?  We would never go back to our old supplier. We will save GBP1200 this year just on energy alone. So we are booking an extra holiday next year with the money we will have saved! :-)
2034|Quite simply useless... DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY... They will charge you for what you haven't used regardless of any meter readings. Customer services are also f**king useless, disputes ongoing for far too long with copy and pasted responses to any queries. Avoid at all cost, go with a real utility company not these bunch of amateur muppets.
2035|I have been  with utility wharehouse for over 6 months saved money on cash back card see all my bills and my cash back cards in full detail.  Customer service was good polite and quick i have already saved about GBP50 0n cash back card on my shopping bills.  even bigger savings a xmas  when xmas shopping 
2036|Buyer beware! I have been with the Utility Warehouse for 5 months. 5 months of hell! I have never before in my life had such appalling customer service. The saleswoman not only mis-sold the product but outright lied. The broadband is not the 24mbps as she advised, but 0.5mbps! (if & when it works!).  I have wasted nearly 20 hours on the phone to them attempting to have problems resolved. To no avail. Now I have to pay a cancellation fee and pay for the return of the modem etc etc. When I agreed to join Utility Warehouse, the lying distributor, stated that there was no cancellation fee. Keep away from this company at all costs. If you don't believe me, look at Martin Lewis's website and check out reviews for 'Useless Warehouse' on the internet. 
2037|I have been a customer for Utility Warehouse approaching a year now and it is clear that I will save around GBP500 on Phone, Broadband, Gas and Electricity, I will also save another GBP500 with their cash back card, So GBP1000 per annum is great. My wife is a Chartered Accountant with her own practice so you can imagine she dot's the i and crosses the T's. She has been so impressed she has now switched to Utility Warehouse Business club for her practice and is equally enjoying great savings. For an Independent  unbiased view readers should look at The which reports which rats Utility Warehouse very high.

2039|My bill for Gas and Electricity from UW covering one (summer) month for a 3 bed semi is GBP400.00+. Yes - that's right. Over FOUR HUNDRED pounds sterling.  Needless to say, I have ditched them.
2040|I have been a customer with UW since 2005 and actually enjoy being a customer as they provide me with fantastic value for money and excellent customer service. The cashback card reduces my monthly bills by 45% on average. There is nothing to dislike about Utility Warehouse
2041|very cheap service makes life easier having one bill best costumer service ive ever used discount club has been very useful
2042|Avoid this company at all costs.Salesperson will not tell you about the GBP50 cancellation fee, the GBP1 minimum call charges nor the GBP1 per month charge for the credit card.  24/7 broadband is non exsistant.
2043|Utility Warehouse, brilliant Company, switched to them from British Gas and saved money on My Gas & Electric.Every time I called customer service I get through withing 15 seconds just as it say's and the staff are very helpful and polite. As far as the Broadband I am due to swith over in and can't wait I am fed up of BT keeps going down , goes slow at times and when I call I am on the phone forever then get put through to Call Centre in another country which all are very polite but I can not always understand them. I have never called BT and got through straight away and it has never taken less than an hour and yes they do charge. I am sure all companies have thier problems sometimes but I am very pleased with the service so far. I have read the Which Magazine articles Best Enegery Supplier and Best Broadband Bundle. Company of the year 2008 FTSE 250. I would rather take notice of reputable articles than a few disgruntled customers.  The Cash back card is unbelievable if you use the membership discounts you can not fail to save money. You can get 50% of West End Shows along with Hotel discounts, so even by buying online you save. Spend and Save how good is that !! Can't please everyone can you. FACT ET 
2044|Absolute crap, rip offs. crap customer care. left them and went to british gas and 2 months later there still charging me
2045|Easy to plan your budget as you can get all utilities on one bill. EASY TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS WITH QUICK AND EFFICIENT SERVICE LEVELS SADLY LACKING WITH MY PREVIOUS PROVIDER!   Found broadband was cheaper by around 5% pa and gas was far cheaper , although bit hit and miss with electricity. A must for me as i  work next to Sainsburys and so shop there and recieved around GBP200pa off my bills.   
2046|We recently had a business line installed at a far cheaper price than BT would have charged. The company who installed the line was BT connect (I understand they are no longer owned by BT).  The main reason however for selecting UW was the cost of their non geographic number service, this allows us to move the business number from line to line, as we are a small business this is very handy indeed. The total 1st year outlay was a 1/3 of the BT option and with the ongoing costs of approx 50% thereafter.  We are now 3 months in and the service has been 1st class.  On this basis I would recommend this service to small business users.  I subscribe to the which magazine, who have given favoured reviews on this company this is why we first contacted them. 
2047|Fantastic service. First rate. I even remember the lady that told about them. She was so kind and patient with us. The bills are clear and easy to understand.
2048|I've been with UWDC for almost 2 years now and never had a problem with them. I take Gas,Electric and Broadcall so all my landline calls are free all the time,great. On the few occassions that i have had to call there internet help line I've found there advisers to be patient,well mannered and extremely helpful too someone who didn't even know how to switch a laptop on at that time. Same with the gas and electric always got through in seconds and no problems they can't help you enough.  quick tip to make your billing more accurate try using there online meter reading service on the last day of every month, my gas and electric balance is well in credit now , ready for the winter months a head. 
2049|"This company-Utility Warehouse - is a complete shower. I transferred first gas and then electricity because their prices seemed competitive. Their invoicing is so confusing - as agreed by their customer service agent - and ensures you are completely bamboozled. To add insult to injury, for about the fifth time,I have footed the telephone bill for extended calls (35 mins this time and still not satisfactorily resolved)to the Customer Service Department.They have tried to charge me surcharges on erroneous invoices which are their fault; their calls are all recorded but if you wish to dispute something they agreed, they will ask GBP15 for the recording!My latest invoice has ""Goodwill against outstanding -GBP18.52"" ""Offset to outstanding balance GBP18.52"" ""Budget Plan reconciliation GBP668.68"" then on the actual invoice side of the bill, it debits GBP650.16 (GBP668.68 - GBP18.52)but then charges me a further GBP18.52 - complete gobble-de-gook. I'm actively finding a new supplier and suggest others do too."
2050|Fantastic Company, top notch customer service, great savings, job done. :)
2051|We were with Scottish power for gas and electric but my wife was persuaded to change to UW supposedly to save money. I was paying GBP60 p/m for gas from Scottish power when we swapped to UW it went up to GBP80!I tried to phone them on Sat to find out why and guess what they dont open on weekends or evenings. If you ever do get through they have the cheek to charge you for the call.I have just paid my final bill to UW at almost GBP400 as they said I have used this much gas. I must be supplying the whole of the northwest!Just got a letter from UW saying I have to return the stupid white pig (telephone) or pay them GBP30 Arghhhhhhhhhh!!!!PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COST
2052|UWDC are a respectable company who carries no debt and are always keeping ahead of the market with value services for consumer and business. Because they promote through distributors it is importnat the person promoting the services are ethical with integrity not just the company. No Contract on services says it all they dont have to tie you in like most companies on utilities and telecoms. Which Best Buy is another reason to take notice.
2053|Great value for money, saved GBP20 a month on Phone and BB, GBP15 A MONTH ON GAS & ELEC.  
2054|Only been with this company for 3 months so it is early days, of course. First impressions are very favourable indeed. The customer service team are housed in the same building as senior company management (i.e. in the UK) and I've never waited more than a few seconds to be speaking to an actual human being. Not an experience I've ever had with any other utility company, I can tell you!  Their gas and electric prices don't compete with the special offer online deals that the Big 6 bring out seemingly every week but I took 4 services (gas, electric, phone, broadband) to maximise the value as that qualifies us to receive 24/7 free calls to UK landlines, 0845/0870 and 10 of the most popular international destinations. We just like the idea of not having to feverishly check the switching sites every bloody week obsessing if we are on the cheapest deal!   Talking of value for money, I have to say what ultimately sold the deal with UW for us was their prepaid cashback card! Before I continue, please be aware this is NOT a credit card but a prepaid Mastercard (accepted everyhwere a Mastercard is so that's pretty much anywhere!).Importantly you cannot spend more on this card than you have loaded onto it, so no horrible expensive debts etc. There is a list of approx 30 huge High Street names that you get 5% off your spend there as a credit on your UW bill. Crucially there is Sainsburys for food AND fuel. As life-long Sainsburys customers we did the sums on this and realised that by using the UW card to buy our food and Fuel instead of our normal debit card we could get approx GBP350 knocked off our annual gas/electric bill (just be buying the stuff we always have done!). This makes the deal easily the cheapest on the market for us. Easily (y0u also get 5% cashbcak at places like Comet, argos, TopShop, Halfords, Boots etc etc). we estimate our total discount for using the card will be over GBP500 this year! Here's our projection for total costs for the next 12 months:  Gas 18000kwhs Electric 3600kwhs Phone Line Rental Up to 24mb broadband 40gb monthly download allowance All calls 24/7 free Monthly paper bill All services you take included on one bill One monthly DD UW cashback card  After deducting the credit from the cashback card spend this lot will cost us approx GBP860 per year, or just under GBP72 per month! Less than we could get just the gas and electric for from the very cheapest online deal. But our price also includes phone line, fast broadband and ALL calls! Unbeatable deal for us. Worth checking out.
2055|i was just a customer and the utility warehouse has saved me GBP12 PER MONTH on my ELECTRIC BILL .so VERY HAPPY with them. NOW I HAVE BECOME A DISTREBUTER ,and SAVING LOTS ON MY CASH BACK CARD. from AMBER VELLA
2056|I have been with Utility Warehouse Discount Club (Telecom Plus PLC) UWDC for five years as a customer. The words 'scam' are totally misleading on some of these reviews (giving the impression of fraud). They are now a FTSE 250 company, voted Small British PLC of the Year on 13.3.09 in the Financial Times and received six Top Reviews (inc. 4 'Best Buy' awards by 'Which' in the last two years). I always follow the 'Which', Financial Times, Shares and Investors Chronicle magazines, who ALL rave about the best British PLC on the market. With over 300,000 customers, they won't always get it right.... but their customer service for me and familiy members has been second to none..... So the word 'scam' should really mean SCAM - Serious Company Advancing the Market. I am not a distributor, just a very happy customer, paying less money out, with a great company.... I also get a rebate on my shopping every month reducing my bills. My broadband is fast (new computer and in an LLU area)..... so stop whining - if you don't like them, then change.... but don't try and put off others, who WILL get a great deal and service with UWDC! 
2057|Utility are a load of rubbish, took on utility warehouse when we moved into our new flat. It would have cost us to go with BT so I thought we will stick with them. We have been with them for 6 months our last electric bill came in at over GBP900!!! I quite clearly stated that there is no way a one bedroom flat could use that much electric unless I am charging a nuclear reactor in my living room. They have read the wrong meter! As a concquence they whacked up our direct debit and took a huge amount of money out my account without notifying me. Crooks spring to mnd !! 
2058|I have been a Utility Warehouse customer for almost 2 years. I have saved over GBP500 per year on my energy bills compared to my previous supplier. The broadband and phone have saved me another GBP150+ per year. The broadband is fast and reliable. If you do need any help, the technical support department is brilliant, and talk basic language that you can understand to help sort out whatever issue you may have. Great services and great support.
2059|It has just cost me GBP650 pounds to settle up with these people after they grossly underestimated my monthly gas bills over a period of 8 months. In the whole time I was with them they didn't read my meter ONCE. Not once.  They then took money from my bank account even though I had cancelled the monthly direct debit. They were completely rude and unhelpful when I tried to call and talk to them and they've just charged me GBP40 for gas after I settled up with them and was already with another company. Avoid like the plague. 
2060|We changed to Utility Warehouse for our gas and electricity after being advised that they could lower our monthly bills. What a load of rubbish. Our bills actually increased by quite a large proportion = no saving at all. We cancelled this and returned straight back to our previous supplier. They appear to say anything to get people to sign up.
2061|Fantastic value> brilliant customer care service and accurate billing plus i can save 5% on my vehicle fuel.
2062|Reading these reviews, it seems like they describe 2 different organisations. I've been a customer for almost 1 year. Never waited more than 30 seconds to speak to somebody. Once called technical re phone line, but was asked to wait due to a queue. I hung up, but they called me back within 5 minutes, apologising for losing my call. Bills are around GBP100 per month lower. I asked to reduce my DD as I felt they'd been estimated too high, and they were fine with that too. I find it really weird that some people find them so poor, when I've been so happy with them that I took up the business opportunity. I always check with my customers post switch, that they are happy, and not one has been unhappy, most have been delighted with the savings and service standards. Not lost one customer in 9 months-that speaks volumes. Many refer friends to me-1 today in fact. Am really quite puzzled by some of the very negative reviews.
2063|Utility warehouse is a scam... i was told to get me to switch on asking the question, Where do utility warehouse get their supply from i was told they generate their own electricity after closly looking into this i found that it certainly wasnt the case at all, therefore i cancelled my bills from utility warehouse as they dont own the power stations in my region or any! they arnt the local distributor. very shameful! 
2064|I'm totally let down with the broadband service. The custoemr service for broad is very poor and e.g. take too long time to get get through the right pple (at least 10 - 15 min). In addition, UWC customer service try to make a bogus claim saying they sent Terms and condition paperwork through the post when I joined which I have never seen one.  Overall, I'm not really convinced with the UWC  Broadband service and about to terminate the contract with an eary termination fees.  
2065|I changed to this company just over 2 weeks ago, and already having grave doubts. The internet is so slow, my husband plays poker and the screen keeps freezing, causing problems. I changed over to them for gas, electricity, phone and broadband, cannot seem to speak to anyone, tried the lady who we signed up with, I am now going to write, if I get no joy, I will be changing back.
2066|" Changed to utility warehouse as friend became a consultant to sell. Nothing but trouble, ripped off from the start, still trying to pay last bill from November 2008, account now with debt collection agency, credit rating ruined, no responsibility from them, unanswered emails, ""call center picked up in 15 seconds"" are you sure it was utility ? Ive beEn on the phone for 20 mins still no reply just stupid message to say they are busy and the call will be answered shortly........rubbish! I am now going to take legal action against them to get this bill paid and to get my credit rating restored ( if they had anything about them they would cancel this bill apologise and restore my credit rating the single most useless cretins Ive ever had the displeasure of doing business ...ops sorry being ripped off with NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER GO TO THIS COMPANY FOR YOUR GAS OR ELECTRIC OR ANY OTHER UTILITY. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED "
2067|The Utility Warehouse is an absolutley amazing company. I actually sell gas and electric for a very reputable company (not UW). Allthought at UW their customer base is low - they usually always work out the cheapest when combining with other services. My research shows that 'Which report magazines' voted them the best for a bunch of awards for the past 2 years. Best part about it is that their BRITISH - Thats right British. The amount of customers that say to me - ohhh your all the same - all foreign countries - all too expensive are the kind of people that when you even show them a better deal for their money they cant be bothered to change because they are loyal to e.g. British Gas (who they don't know are french) and are happy to be paying higher rates. Some people are truly not happy with what ever service they have!
2068|Can't comment on their service because we were told by them that they DON'T SPEAK TO  CUSTOMERS!!!! and that was before we started using them.How reassuring is that.My advice is don't use them.
2069|I was persueded by a financial advisor to switch to Uwclub from BT, whom I was having endless problems with. I was told by Uwclub that if I was not happy, I could switch back with no charge. When I attempted to do this I was told that it would cost GBP50 as I hadn't had it for a year. My husband cannot use his Xbox online as the internet is so slow. We tried to download a film on it, and it took so long that the 24 hours allocated to watch it had ran out! The customer service advisor kept repeating that his Xbox works fine, bully for him!! and accused my husband of lying. The bill's are far more expensive than BT, even though we are gold members and don't pay for most of our call's. I have switched to my previous supplier for electric too as this was more expensive. The only good thing is that they answer the phones really quickly, but then keep you on hold for an eternity when you do get through. I am thoroughly disgusted with this company. I would only recommend them to my worst enemy. AVOID AT ALL COST'S!!!!!
2070|Been a customer with utility warehouse since April 2009 and what a great company to deal with!My gas and electric is now GBP20 pm cheaper and i'm over GBP50 in credit on the gas!!!UK call centre anwers after only 15-20 secs...friendly staff.....great service....
2071|My bills was quiet high and when I became a Utility Warehouse  customer it made sense to have all the services like landline phone, mobile, gas, electric and soon internet moved to UW.From day one, brilliant service. The bills, are not different bills but one bill, which makes it easy for me to file away. I saved money, and also, I'm thinking of uw as a serious business.Why? Their customer service is excellent. I even saw the distributor who signed me as a customer call them, and they guided him through every step of the form because he was new.I'm very, very impressed.The customer service itself is worth it and personally, I'm tired of all these companies make money off me and give no respect. So glad I am now a Utility warehouse customer.
2072|DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  We moved into a house which had gas and electricity supplied by this company and immediately tried to switch to our last provider.  Utility warehouse MADE UP THE READINGS (they were out by 3000 units) on the final gas bill as they disagreed with the start reading we provided, which was later verified by Siemens.
2073|I've been with Utility Warehouse for a few years now and have always found them to be fine. They adjust the direct debit amounts each year and the account has stayed pretty well level.
2074|The customer service at Utility Warehouse is dreadful. They have been taking GBP135 per month off me but only GBP108 shows as paid on my bill. Already overpaid by GBP200+. I have rung them 3 times today and waited all day for a call back from a manager but no call is forthcoming. I will be switching as soon as i can arrange it. Would not recommend to anyone
2075|i hve been with The Utility Warehouse and at the first the company is very good and also very cheap in regards to there prices but people that are currently with them know that you can get into credit with them by saving for the winter when you use more energy just like myself but then it came to me moving home and closing my account and i have never known a company that does not wish to give money back i requested my money to be returned to me on the 17/06/2009 and i still have not had my money back from them yet and we are nearlly two and a half months on i would not recommend getting in credit with them and also make sure your keep track of them and your money
2076|i hve been with Utility Warehouse  and at the first the company is very good and also very cheap in regards to there prices but people that are currently with them know that you can get into credit with them by saving for the winter when you use more energy just like myself but then it came to me moving home and closing my account and i have never known a company that does not wish to give money back i requested my money to be returned to me on the 17/06/2009 and i still have not had my money back from them yet and we are nearlly two and a half months on i would not recommend getting in credit with them and also make sure your keep track of them and your money
2077|This Utility Warehouse is a company that i joined about a year ago and i was paying them around GBP78 per month for my gas and i am due a refund on money i was in credit by but this is where they fault it has taken me over two months to be able to get my money back i have now been in direct contact with them and have since told me that my chq has been sent again for the 3rd time so dont be let down to you when this happensi would never advise anyone that i like to get involved with this comapany no matter what. In regards to this and i hav also advised all my family who are with them to be aware of this seems a big scam to me i will follow this up with another review when i do finally get my money back keep posted guys 
2078|Was persuaded to switch to Utility Warehouse from EON my monthly bill went up from GBP34 to GBP92!!! when usage probably went down as summer. Now having to go though the process of switching again.Messages left on my phone are difficult to follow and have to be replayed several times to get numbers off as the operator speaks so quickly.Not impressed
2079|There's plenty of better prices available, and watch that you're getting the same (for example, The Utility Warehouse Discount Club don't give you a router for their broadband) as with other companies.  Also watch out as they make you pay a 'membership fee' each month.Customer service department is all but non-existant, they take weeks to respond to even simple requests. Wouldn't even bother with them!  We are now back with original supplier, and much better off for it. 
2080|We have been with the Utility Warehouse Discount club for nearly 6 years and have had nothing but great service from them. The bill is extremely easy to understand with everything broken down in a simplified way-my 5 year old could understand it! We have our gas, electric, broadband, phone and now the cash back card. The cash back card saves you money off your gas and electric and also helps you manage your finances, so thumbs up all round. We have got both sets of parents and grandparents to join the Utility Warehouse, and they are all very happy too and have slashed pounds off their bills.
2081|Have been with UW for some 5 years now. My last bill, August 09, for 5 Utilities including Gas, Electricity, Landline, Broadband, and mobile came to GBP65 ONLY!!!I have 3 bedroomed house.Who needs to look around? if prices are this cheap! Enough said.
2082|Absolutly fantastic customer service from the utility warehouse discount club, UK call centres and they answer the phone with in 15 seconds, absolutly top notch, love getting my utility bill through the post its absolutly fantastic, everything is itemized and easy to read, brillient, i liked the company so much that i have decided to work for them because i can earn a substantial income and make my self financially secure with a bit of hard work, to all you sceptics out there, its a FTSE 250 company, licenced by ofgem and ofcom, that is so powerfull, even richard branston couldent get a licence off them its fantastic, there should be more companys like this because the world would be such a better place, thanks.
2083|signed up to UW to raise funds for my daughter's guide pack but the 'welcome letter' showed a higher rate than I was quoted originally. Tried to call them to discuss but I had to wait on the phone for over 10 mins and then was put on hold for another 5 minutes.Have today asked to go back to my original supplier. 
2084|Ok where do i start!!! I took out whole package with utilities warehouse for my home around 3 years ago everything was great so then took out same services on business premises. Then i moved house and found i could get services cheaper so cancelled. This is where it all went wrong they were owe me around 300 pounds as i had been over paying after 6 months of phone calls and letters i recieved 100 pound back so i'm already 200 down. I then cancelled my business package due to the shocking service i recieved they told me they were owe me GBP500 and i worked it all out to be the same then it has taken me 18months and i'm not exagerrating to get the money back but all they sent was GBP130 back i am currently pursuing this awful company through energy watch dog. CONSUMERS BEWARE DO NOT USE THIS DREADFUL COMPANY!!!!!!!!
2085|I have been with Utility Warehouse since May 06. I have had to deal on many many occasions with very rude unprofessionals.They opening Hours are appalling for people who need to sort out bills. They take ages to answer to which you are being charged. I have switched my Electric and Phone and Broadboard, but they have refused to transfer my gas saying I owe them GBP1500.00. The have grossly over-estimated my readings and I have had a Estimated reading from day one. I have paid for a professional to sort out my bill, and it has come to like that I have more than likely have overpaid by GBP200.00. They Owe me, not the other way round. 
2086|Truely diabolical customer service from the utility warehouse discount club. I have a number of my rental properties with this company and am in the process of moving them all to British Gas.
2087|Awful service, expensive, the broadband is really quite terrible from the utility warehouse.  Very slow, takes about 4 weeks to set up and they stick an extra charge onto your bill as a 'membership fee' that certainly makes sure their cheaper rates become more expensive than most.
2088|The Utility Warehouse Discount Club are not the cheapest out there (if you claim to be someone will always under cut you) but by far the best customer service out there. 
2089|I've been using Utility Warehouse for 1 an half year..all i can say is REALLY GOOD SERVICE. CHEAP BILLSSAVED OVER GBP50 (Before i was using british gas)British gas is Expensive! Same quality with enery..nothing better than utility warehouse.But UW is really cheap! The qualities are the same! what else are you looking for??Try it. Have it. Love it. 
2090|Just swapped my gas & electric,with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club perfect no problems swop over, 20% saving, 1 bill, 1 direct debit..could be HAPPIER!!Friend done hers...same as above....Think SKY has better phone, broandand deal as it incoporates basic SKY package but with discoount card with UW as well, very very pleased!
2091|I've been a Utility warehouse customer since September last year and have been really bemused to see some of the bad reviews about them - my own personal interaction with the company has been nothing but good - there have been glitches in the move but they sorted them out slow in some instances and fast in others but they got them sorted!  They were polite - the customer services answered the phone quite quickly and I could understand what they said...  I cant recommend them enough and get money off my bill for doing so!
2092|Utility Warehouse are completely useless! We have had nothing but trouble with them from the word go. They conned us out of hundreds of pounds and we are still fighting with them to get in back. The staff are incompetent and rude and the bills are huge. Don't go anywhere near them!
2093|Couldn't believe some of the negative reviews (until I read the reviews on the other suppliers on here and realised that in most instances people will be motivated to review something if they have had a bad experience and not vice versa). So, by way of giving balance to the reviews, I thought I'd post my experience of this company.I'd genuinely never heard of the utility warehouse before I got a flyer through my door. What really piqued my interest was the fact that Sainsburys customers could get very decent discounts off their bills by using the Utility Warehouse cash back card to pay for their shopping. We have been regular Sainsburys shoppers for ages (groceries and petrol) and calculated we spend an average of GBP170 per week there. This would ordinarily be paid for on our debit card so we did a few sums to try and work out how much discount we would get on our bill by doing this on the UW card. Almost GBP450 a year!!! (especially when you consider the 5% discount also applies to massive household names like Argos, Boots, Homebase, Topshop, Wallis etc etc).We decided to sign up for 4 services (gas, electric, phone line and broadband) thereby qualifying us to receive 24/7 free calls (including 0845/0870 and 10 popular international destinations). This was approx 5 months ago. What can I say? The service has been unbelievably good (previously with BT for phone, BG for gas, npower for electric and Sky for broadband so we just assumed poor customer service was the norm. Wrong.), the broadband speeds are rock solid and totally reliable, we don't get charged for calls any more (fantastic!) and to top it all off we average a GBP40 per month discount off the bill each month owing to our spend on the cash back card (which isn't a credit card, btw, so no spending money you haven't got!).Here's what we get fron Utility Warehouse:Gas - 20,000 kwhs per yearElectric - 4,200 kwhs per yearUp to 24mb broadband40gb monthly download allowanceAll 01, 02, 03, 0845/0870, 10x Intl destination landline numbers freePhone line rentalOne PAPER bill each month detailing all the services we takeOne direct debit amount for the whole lot.100% UK-based customer service teamNO stupid min. contract terms on any of the services (watch out for these with companies like talktalk, british Gas and BT!)Our monthly direct debit to cover all this? Wait for it - GBP84.00!!Fantastic deal.
2094|The Utility Warehouse bills are hard to read, their customer service appears poorly trained and not very courteous, and their communication is generally poor.  Would not recommend. Moving from them was a nightmare as well, but British Gas were excellent.  Watch out!
2095|These people are rude, unhelpful and inept. They are not as cheap as they make out either with membership fees and standing charges.  They have never got a bill right since I joined and now I have left them they are trying to charge me GBP110 more than I owe. 
2096|Fantastic company and fantasic savings especially with the discount card. Never had any problem with the utility warehouse discount club customer service, they have always responded promptly.
2097|How's this for customer care? 10.30am, broadband went off. Checked phone -- no dial tone. Rang Utility Warehouse customer services, connected in about 15 seconds. UW guy checked various things, I pressed buttons, no joy, UW guy said we'll keep you informed. 12.30noon, text message saying fault had been found at the exchange. 2.30pm-ish, phone call from UW to say engineers were on the case. 5.30pm (same day) fault was solved. FANTASTIC service and couldn't hesitate to recommend them.
2098|Utility Warehouse saved me more money than I could imagine. I used to pay  GBP65 a month to Eon or powergen as it was then and I've never paid anywhere near that since I've been with UWDC
2099|Been with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club for 2 years now. Rude customer service staff. Cut off my broadband for no reason. Very expensive as well. 
2100|Used The Utility Warehouse Discount Club for 2 years, completely taken in by their advertising.  Found that I could have been saving  GBP GBP GBPs with any of 3 other suppliers.  Current dual fuel energy bill with them  GBP1212 p.a.  Just ordered British Gas websaver 3 where same consumption will cost  GBP1069.  U.W. say their price guarantee does not apply to web deals.  Very unfriendly emails from them.  Recommend do your own research to find cheapest supplier in your area for your usage.
2101|We have been with the UWH for about 5 years. It's been the worse 5 years of my life dealing with these people. When you have any problems, they are rude, don't care and hide behind the phone. They advertise ALL MEMBERS can get the gold membership service, you cant.Only new members can. I have reported this to Trading Standars, who had a meeting with them mid April 2009 and told them to change their web site. To date, 11th June, they still havn't. I have told the Trading Standards, AGAIN and lets hope they do something about the mis-leading infomation on the site. If you want to use a good company, DONT USE THE UWH 
2102|Brilliant setup and excellent customer service. I have been a customer for with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club 4 years now, not a bad word to say.Cheaper billsVery helpful staffOne single bill
2103|I  have found utility warehouse to exceed my expectations, i now  get regular monthly bills  and not 4 different bills sent at different times as it is all in 1 bilk.The 5% cashback card allows me to get money off my bill with my shopping and petrol.The gas and electric may not always be the cheapest but once yoy add in all your free call, cashback card and cheaper phoneline rental you save a hell of a lot more than with any other company.
2104|Utility warehouse is a complete rip-off, there bills are not cheaper, check your bills on Which Switch, I went from paying  GBP400 a year (British Gas) for my gas to over  GBP700 with Utility Warehouse. Their customer service is very poor, with rude employees. There is nothing special about this company. Please don't be fooled, check it all out before you swap, they are crooks.
2105|The Utility Warehouse - SIGN ME UP!I have just been introduced to the Utility Warehouse by a relative and I felt that I had to write to recommend it to others.I took the Broadcall package which costs me  GBP19.99 per month for 24Meg speed and 40Gig download ( far more than enough for my needs ). This price also includes the Phone Line rental.I also switched my Gas & Electricity supplier to The Utility Warehouse and because I have taken 4 services ( the Broadcall counts as 2 ) I am entitled to FREE UK landline calls at any time, plus FREE calls to my son in the USA and sister in Australia who I will be in touch with on a more regular basis now.So I am saving  GBP25 per month on my phone/internet services AND getting the calls for free.They have a Cashback card which I am looking forward to saving money with (you get 5% off all you spend at Sainsburys, Argos, Comet, Boots and loads of other high street stores).This comes off my Utility Warehouse monthly bill and I reckon that I spend about  GBP100 per week on groceries and petrol so I will have a cashback each month of at least  GBP20.By the way the monthly bill covers ALL my utilities and it is FULLY itemised, unlike my last phone bill which just gave me a summary of my calls.Saving at least  GBP45 per month for doing nothing but switch! You can see why I felt it necessary to share this. I have only once had cause to call the Customer Support line for assistance but I was amazed that I was connected immediately, when phoning my previous Gas supplier I was on hold for 20 minutes
2106|I have recently switched over my Home Phone / Broadband , Gas and Electricity, online to the Utility Warehouse. As well as my Business Phone (Only a small business) to which i now only pay around  GBP40 a month, which used to be  GBP60 a month when i was with BT.The transition over to Utility Warehouse was really easy and caused me no problems what so ever.I am now only paying  GBP19.99 a month for my home phone line rental with free calls all the time and 24 mg Broadband which is brilliant.I was paying BT  GBP13 a month just for my Line Rental and then about another  GBP15 for calls and  GBP10 for broadband!I have now seen this package from Utility Warehouse in 'WHICH' magazine as the 'Best Buy' which means i'm obviously not the only one happy with this Bundle package!The Gas and Electric tariff i am now on with them is also lower than what i was paying my previous supplier and feel this switch over is one of the best moves i've ever made.I also now get all this services on ONE monthly bill now which makes keeping an eye on my finances much easier.Would recommend them to everyone.
2107|I would not recommend utility warehouse to anyone!!! they told me i was not allowed to move suppliers after i got a huge payment plan through(not the quote they told me when i applied) they refused southern electrics offer for us to move even when we owed them nothing and had paid the outrageous gas and elec bill they had provided to us and are now disconnecting our power because they are accusing us of not paying! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BAD SUPPLIER!!  southern electric all the way!!!! they offer argos vouchers when you build points from paying bills on time BRILLIANT!
2108|great service and ive saved a lot of money by switching to the utility warehouse discount club. cheap and great customer care.
2109|I was getting ready to write a horrid review about the broadband part of utility warehouse. We were getting no download at all at one point getting 20kbps download rate. After my 3rd call and about to esculate the problem to BT I was asked to try one last thing - try the test socket. Low and behold my broadband problem was fixed we now have broadband running at 3.7mbps in both pc's. I am pleased.
2110|I am with Utiltity Warehouse for 1 year now, was told the cheapest on electricity, but is the worst. I would never recomend anyone to join Utility Warehouse..because they send Estimated Bills,even though we submitted meter readings through Meter Reading Line.The Customer Service Team is also not helpful,just waste of time.
2111|Utility Warehouse used to be very good however I have had nothing but trouble off them in recent months.  We moved out of our office premises and their automated systems could not get their head round the fact that there was only anyone there 2 hours a week.  They constantly billed me over  GBP90 per month for electricity despite repeatedly telling them.  They never give out a full name and you're constantly on hold with them or you get cut off when they transfer you from pillar to post (all the time generating revenues for them from their premium rate telephone numbers).  Would never use again. 
2112|I've been with the utility warehouse for ten years now and wouldn't dreamm of going back to BT, British Gas etc. They respond within 15 seconds if I have had to call their customer service department. In ten years that's been only a handful of times. I recently had a problem with my line. It turns there wasn't a problems but they were efficient in everything they did.I can't praise them highly enough. 
2113|Been with Utility Warehouse for years now. The fisrt time i have had a company that is helpful - easy to get hold of 
2114|Triple Value Guarantee - absolutely worthless!  The Utility Warehouse Discount Club guarantee to be cheaper than the absolutely most expensive tariff that it is possible to get!Try any comparison site for energy and they come out amongst the bottom of all the deals available - even more expensive than buying from British Gas and your local supplier.  
2115|Had electricity from Utility Warehouse, they could never send an accurate bill out would ring with actual meter readings, but they have a policy of not sending out revised bills, changed supplier, rang and paid outstanding amount by phone, then weeks later get a bill for  GBP75, which I am still disputing.  Useless this company is useless it doesn't supply any thing, all they have to do is bill people and they can't even do that right.I suspect that all of you that insist you are saving money haven't checked your readings and bills, you just assume its right- chances are it isn't. leave well alone
2116|I left Utility Warehouse 5 months ago and unfortunately for us we are only just getting to the bottom of resolving the issue, hassles and problems that they have caused.They did not sort out my opening reading properly nor did they sort out my closing reading properly.They refunded me  GBP60 when i still owed them  GBP214, they have been nothing but rude in their conversations with me, in addition to giving me false information. I honestly do not believe their accounts department knows what the left hand is doing from the right, especially when they billed me for  GBP1026, quite a shock when i'd only been with them two and a half months, it turned out they'd made a mistake, only rectified following a very upset call from myself.
2117|customer service and after sales service is terrible. senior person in The Utility Warehouse Discount Club insists there preferred method of communication is by a computer generated letter.  not interested in working for you, questions the value they put on your custom.
2118|I wasnt even with Utility Warehouse for more than 2 months (only with them because previous occupants were before I switched over to Ebico when I moved in). Anyway the bill they first sent me had incorrect readings (which is fine) so rang and gave correct readings and asked for new bill to be sent out. This bill never came only a collections letter charging me  GBP370! I rang and complained and they said they would sort out the correct amount in a bill. This eventually came out and had on it the final bill amount. They hadn't reinbursed me for phone calls on this bill like they said they would in previous phonecalls (I was on the phone a number of times to them). So I rang again, had phone call costs reinbursed and paid final amount and specifically checked with them that I would not have to deal with them again and this was the final bill amount and now the account would be closed. I was spefically told it would be. Foward 6 weeks later and they sent me a bill for around  GBP70. When I rang they told me I still had to pay this amount as the person that told me the account would be paid off previously was incorrect. Spoke to a manager, they said they would listen to recorded previous phone call but it would not make any difference to the fact I would still have to pay them a further amount. Spent absolutely loads of time on the phone to them. They refuse to take responsibilty for their error. Would never go back to them and would recommend the same.
2119|have had nothing but problems with utility warehouse. was promised a 24mps broadband connection. it has never been faster than 1.2mps. very unhelpful on the phone. avoid like the plague.
2120|The Utility Warehouse Discount Club discount card that was introduced last year certainly means you will save around  GBP500 a year if you make good use of the 5% off household shopping which is taken off your overall bill
2121|Worst customer service ever from pay cheap bills, show no empathy.  They only have three tarriffs for gas and haven't cut their plans unlike everyone else You'll be sold them by someone you may consider a friend who will earn commission on your bills!!!!  Absolute joke.
2122|It would appear that most of the energy providers have reduced their prices, UW have not. Their custmer services said they were waiting for prices to stabalise before they would alter their prices. I find they are also slow to cancel accounts and I think they are one of the worst broadband providers. I have found some advisors helpful but others aren't.
2123|"Ive been with Utility Warehouse a couple of years, however, a fault appeared on the line and I could not get it sorted. I decided to cancel the line but they still insist on charging me for 30 days. Today I told them that I would take my gas and electric elsewhere and was told ""OK.""I still cannot believe their attitude. I never missed a payment, never complained and for them to say ""OK."" I cannot believe that in the current climate where people are losing their jobs that a ""Customer Service"" advisor could speak to me in such a nonchalant manner."
2124|I ummed and arred when I saw the details of The Utility Warehouse Discount Club. I mean, it doesn't advertise so i'de never heard of it before, they employ local agents to sell the service/provide back-up etc.I knew the prices of the bundle deal I wanted were unbeatable and the one bill for all services approach appealed but I still proctrasinated. Superb bundle deals
2125|I joined Utility Warehouse on the advice of an acquaintance who assured me that it would be far cheaper than my current supplier. After it took an age to get things properly set up and changed over, I was horrified when I received my first bill to find it was substantially more expensive than the bills I was getting from my previous supplier. I quickly switched back to my previous supplier and guess what - much cheaper bills! However, for some reason even though I have now been back with my old supplier for 2 months I am still getting charged by Utility Warehouse for a period that I should have been with my old supplier - how can you get charged by 2 different suppliers for the same period?  Wouldn't recommend them. 
2126|I read about The Utility Warehouse and was recommended to them by one of their distributors. All i can say is i am glad i have switched. consistently lower bills than any other provider i have used and their bills are much clearer and more accurate.i have been with them for just over a year now.
2127|had I been told when we joined The Utility Warehouse that I would be facing a large bill at the end of year I would have never joined them. You may think the are cheaper but when they hit you with a hidden bill you soon find out the truth. I got a nice letter from the telling I now owe a further  GBP495.00 even though I have been paying the bill every month on a budget account. I contacted the help line, they were rude and did not sort out the problem, as far as they are concerned the bill gets reviewed every 12 months and then they change it. A not our problem attitude I have not got the extra money to pay them
2128|The Utility Warehouse Discount Club gave us hope of cheaper utilities..but there was a different person every time on their call centre, never managed to get items sorted.  without phone and broadband for 2 weeks!Transferred to them promised to save me money - total chaos - lost phone and broadband could not sort it out - had to go back to BT and nearly lost my phone number.  I do not think they are any cheaper than if i had done it myself.
2129|Excellent value for moneycustomer service very goodbeen a happy customer for 7 years. overall I am a very satisfied with Utility Warehouse.  UW reward you for being a customer I get money off my bill that is already cheap by using my cashback card when I do my shopping and if I refer a friend which I do I get money off my bill.
2130|The Utility Warehouse does exactly what it says on the tin.  Weare saving a considerable amount of money each month.  Although our energy may not always be the cheapest, over the whole bundle (mobiles, home phone, broadband, gas and electric) we are saving a substantial amount of money and are very happy with the level of service that we are getting.  The broadband is the best that we have experienced, we don't pay for our landline calls - what more can I say?
2131|Been with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club for about five years now and their service and products seem to get better and better.  Everything is on one bill and their sales rep explained everything very clearly.  Their call centre is based in the UK which is a huge advantage to me and on the couple of times I've rung them it felt like I got through within 15 seconds.They don't tie you into any contracts so give it a go.
2132|Early last year, I signed-up for the full utility warehouse package - broadcall ( with security ), dual-fuel & club membership. Fixed line calls within the UK are 'free'. Tech support is OK but limited & on-going problems are dealt with by a different advisor every time I ring in. On the standard tariff for gas & electricity, I have just discovered that Npower could save me over  GBP180 pa based on my current monthy payments by direct debit. At the end of my one-year contract I shall review the position with a view to  splitting the services using other providers.
2133|I find the Utility Warehouse service nad, Internet seems sluggish, gas and electricity are appear to be more expansive than others.more expansive that other broadband provider- broadband is incredibly slow. I pay for 8Mb, but I seem to get less than one.- I find customer service unhelpful. If I send them an email, their response is very slow- It has taken time for every service I've asked for to be available.- I find the website hard to use.
2134|I signed up to Utility Warehouse for phone line/broadband/gas and electric about 6 months ago. I was previously with British Gas for gas, npower for electric and BT for phone line/broadband. Immediate massive monthly savings on what I was previously paying! Because I take 4 services from them I quailfy for FREE 24/7 global calls (includes all 01,02 UK landlines and also other countries like US, France, Australia, Hong Kong etc). We have family in both the US and Australia so FREE calls to them at any time of day or night - amazing!And to top it off I have now got the new Utlity Warehouse cashback card which gives 5% discount off your UW bill for shopping at approx 25 retailers. This INCLUDES Sainsburys for food and fuel. We regularly spend  GBP150 per week on food and fuel at Sainsburys alone (plus we also spend regularly at the other stores lke Homebase, Boots, Halfords, Miss Selfridge, Argos etc etc, we estimate a total  GBP10,000 per year spend on the card) so this will effectively give us a MASSIVE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS off our Utility warehouse bill, which equates to over  GBP40 per month!!). We have also recommended the deal to a few friends and now receive a FURTHER 10% of our monthly bill!! This deal just cant be beaten!!! We are fairly high fuel users!Our deal: Gas = 23000 kwh per yearElectricity = 5700 kwh per yearPhone Line RentalUNLIMITED Broadband (up to 24mb!)Free Wireless RouterFree 24/7 calls (including calls to other countries - my brother lives in the US and my wife's sister lives in Australia!!)Club membership (we have the silver one so qualify for free calls to customer services and broadband help) GBP10,000 accidental death insurance.Dedicated 100% UK-based Call Centre (no dealing with Indian call centres - bliss!)Chance to receive up to 2.5% ONGOING discount off your monthly bill by recommending the company to friends (All they do is call a freephone number and quote your account number!)Monthly PAPER BILL fully itemised including ALL the services you use.ONE MONTHLY DD no matter how many services you take.ALL FOR A NET  GBP100 PER MONTH BY DD!!BEAT THAT!!
2135|The Utility Warehouse Discount Club seem to mee to be SUPERB VALUE FOR MONEY, very helpful everytime i have called i have been connected to a real person, within seconds unlike the others, waiting ages on hold!

2136|Lower bills andThe Utility Warehouse Discount Club promise to keep them low means you don't have to keep switching supplier. Their customer service is great compared to their competitorsWe've been customers for 6 months and have gas, electricity, phone and broadband. I'm also getting my mobile phone moved over to them.
2137|"I joined utility warehouse before christmas. Had nothing but problems since. We ended up with no phone or broadband and had to get BT back on because it was such a mess. Not good for a business that does a lot of orders online and over the phone! Didn't even get so much as an explanation or apology from ""customer services"".Electricity is being charged at a rate higher than that on our contract. I had a bill for a mobile which i never even took with them. They have tried to overcharge massively (guesstimated readings) for electric, and told me it needed to be paid then they could work from a meter reading in a couple of months.Customer services are incredibly unhelpful and sometimes plain rude. You could argue this may be a minority i have spoken to, but considering i have spent what feels like 2 working days on the phone to them in the past couple of months, i think i have probably spoken to most of the customer service reps.All in all i wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy, just waiting for a new supplier to take over the electric then i can look forward to never dealing with them again."
2138|I have been with utility warehouse for a couple of months now, and find them to be much cheaper than british gas and electricity, their broadband is excellent value for money, no line rental from BT, and their customer service has been fantastic. I now save 5% on all my shopping and fuel, which is brilliant when i'm trying to tighten my belt. The Lady that came to the house, was polite and never pushed for a sale...the product sels it self, it really does do what it says on the tin. It's brilliant and i would reccomend it to anyone to try it.
2139|We have found Utility Warehouse do exactly what they claim. They provide gas and electricity that are consistently cheaper than the competition, great value for money compared with BT for line rental and calls, and absolutely cracking broadband deals. We believe they are the only company in the UK to provide all these utilities and the more you subscribe to, the more you save. Best of all there's no contracts so if you want to change to a more expensive supplier you can, though why would you?
2140|Utility Warehouse Discount Club disconnected my phone line and Internet and charged me  GBP50 for the disruption of the services. Sent a bill saying due to a mistake done by UW the services were disrupted, but for re-installation I have to pay  GBP99!!! Help desk - poor, I called four times - many promises, no refunds. No real reply to emails- just autoresponders.
2141|I was recommended to join utility warehouse by a friend and was a little hesitant first as I had never heard of them. Then I read in WHICH? magazine that they were voted the No1 utility provider and I now know why. They make it all so easy with one bill for everything and you can speak to one person about all of your utilties.
2142|Cheapest PAYG mobile service and 5% off ALL my shopping petrol and Christmas presents. Utility Warehouse Discount Club are amazing!I subscribe to Which? magazine and they regularly sing UW's praises. In Oct 08 they voted UW BEST energy supplier, BEST value for money and BEST for telephone support. Also gave UW highest customer satisfaction rating. This company is unique as far as I can see in that they are totally customer focused and because they sell via distributors, they don't have advertising costs that are passed on to customers. I am totally happy I switched ALL my services to UW. Don't see why I need ever consider another company to provide what they do - oh yeah, thats cos there isn't one.
2143|If you want a cheap then they are good but be expecting the quality of service to be reflected on this I thought. They over charged me by 3x the correct amount on my direct debit and so far has simply refused to refund it. I have spoken to my bank who are currently disputing this for me! I have now cancelled my account and would not recommend this.
2144|I recently signed up Utility warehouse. The Broadcall is excellent value for money and I don't have to pay BT line rental. The broadband even works with my Mac with no problems. The electricity is about a third cheaper than my previous supplier Npower
2145|I have never complained about any company or service on one of these review things but I am so totally fed up with Utility Warehouse and their poor service. They overcharged me by more than  GBP500 for my electricity in a few months and it took endless calls to rectify.  It has taken them 7 months to send someone round to see that one of my electricity meters has been disconnected.  I reckon in the 3 years I have (unfortunately) been with them, I have spent over 15 hours on the phone or attempting to contact them with a variety of queries or complaints.  Am happily with another company now - ANY other company!!
2146|read most of these ratings before i signed up with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club - most providers generally have a mix of very good and some times not such good comments.  I didnt find any surprise charges - none.  Everything made sense, I am definitley making a saving.  A had a call from another provider recently who was sure he could save me money - he insisted!  I got my bill and compared prices.  I think the sales chap is considering changing himself.  Customer services - touch wood - have so far been great.  No problems at all.  I had full blown arguments with my previous supplier!   You cannot please everyone - I get the impression that for those people who feel like they havent had a good experience that they want to have a proper rant.  I recommended these guys to my family - all happy so far.  I work from home and need good broadband - mine is great.  Very quick, hasnt gone down once (not like my previous supplier!!!!!!!!).  
2147|I have been a customer of Utility warehouse for 6 years now and the services get better. The broadcall package they do is superb value. Everything is on one bill so if you do have a query the number is the same for any of the services and you just get out the bill. Take a look at this company it knows how to treat its customers well and you don`t get passed from pillar to post.
2148|I would avoid Utility Warehouse at all costs for Broadband Services. Their customer care department was poor in my case and any problems you have with the line will be charged at a high rate with little means of challenging them. Utility Warehouse appears to be a middleman and pays BT for line repairs etc. Utility Warehose did not challenge BT when we had a  dispute and just charged me.
2149|i would never recommend The Utility Warehouse Discount Club to anyone - they have been very poor in my case - I finally disentangled myself from them and am now with toucan.com who are a lot cheaper and absolutely fabulous.
2150|Been with UW for 8 months, was with Talk Talk, Customer service is 50 times better. Just got a discount card so every time I shop I get 5% of what I spend off my Utility bill, BRILLIANT. Cheaper than Bt, BG and EDF, Broadband is brilliant and I got a free laptop
2151|If you want less hassle and cheaper bills this company is for you,we were with british gas and they still cant get gas & electric bills in one envelope!,we have six serices on one bill,and if we reccomend them to anyone we get 2.5% off our bill for each customer reffferal for as long as they remain customers!!
2152|Great to get away from the big companies-Good value for money and everything is on one bill-They have a good variety of services-but the mobile phone deals aren't the best around-The broadband can be a bit slow sometimes, but most are these days
2153|Bills are accurate and customer service very efficient and friendily. Send you a box of chocolates when you move house.I have a been a customer for 3 years and moved house in that time and got a box of chocolates when we did. Very nice touch.
2154|We are only 4 months into the change to Utlility Warehouse (gas, electric, land line, broadband) and so far we have seen substantial total savings. The bills are very clear and easy to understand unlike British Telecom and most gas companies.
2155|I only joined the The Utility Warehouse Discount Club for gas. I found inaccurate bills and some rude staff in their premium rate call centre and it has taken ages to sort this out. The period of time I was with them I used about 40 units of gas, I'm a low user, instead they bill me for over GBP500! Needless to say I never paid them and the situation is still ongoing even though I left them 6 months ago.
2156|Generally UW are a good company apart from my gripes above.I have never had any issues on payments. the service has never failed B/B or phone.If the broadband was cheaper and faster I would not leave but I am concidering changing the B/B only...
2157|This is the first time I've ever changed in over 50 years of using electricity and gas. I'm glad I did. I got all my broadband and telephone bills together and switched those as well.
2158|All our charges from The Utility Warehouse are on one bill-great customer service call centre in uk-british company-with uw triple value guarantee on energy you will get fair deal so no need to keep changing. Great broadband - bt open reach still repair your phone line if it goes wrong.Give you a chance - look at their share price they are a growing company-lots of business customers joining also.As far as utility companys go they are the best in my opinion.
2159|I got on board with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club through my local agent. He handled our questions very well and the switch was very smooth. I do still check their prices regularly and they always seem to be very competitive so I have never felt the need to witch again - joy!
2160|Great value for money and all on one bill - fantastic service from a UK based customer call centre, a rare thing in this day and age. Friendly and helpful call centre, very cheap compared to my old bills.
2161|I have been with the Utility Warehouse for 18 months now and I would never switch back to my old suppliers; I have cut my spend on monthly bills by 35%!Customer services have always been friendly and helpful and the calls are free (I'm a silver club member) which is brilliant. I have also saved a bundle on insurance and going out with the club membership offers/vouchers. I'd recommend them to anyone.
2162|Within the terms & conditions book, which I did not get until after I had applied for the mobile phone I found there is a PAC charge of 20 quid.Nothing mentioned on the application form which specifically points out Important Information you should read before signing the application.
2163|Really unhappy with The Utility Warehouse. When I have been late with payments for only a few days they were quick to charge me. However, in this instance they missed something and miscommunication on their behalf occurred. This means they owe me money now, but they've said it can take up to 2 months before I get it back. Now that doesn't seem fair to me.
2164|The Utility Warehouse Discount Club is the only company that is lse listed for 10-years+ and guarantees savings over the majority of your utility bills. with no advertising, no sales people and no telesales - where do you think the savings go - into the customers of course - this company bucks the trend of you don't get nowt for nowt - you do with utilities warehouse!
2165|I signed up after seeing a report Which magazine, the price for broadband is very reasonable and the connection speed is a lot faster than my previous provider, Talk Talk. Wasn't sure about switching my energy but I'm paying slightly less than what I had been paying with Powergen and I now get free phone calls.
2166|I think The Utility Warehouse Discount Club are not quick to move with the market, I feel some of the mobiles are in need of being heavily overhauled. I also think some independent distributors need more training as I have met enough who have only been trained once and don't seem to have a clue. Summary: Very good, but i do think they require some serious improvements.
2167|Had an account with them, never again, worst company I have ever dealt with in my opinion. Fault with my telephone line ended up costing me over  GBP200 even though they said there would be no charge. I am now back with BT and saving money compared with UW. With UW I was paying more for my electricity than with SWEB I pointed this out to UW they agreed I was paying more but didn't reimburse the difference.
2168|Yes, Utillity Warehouse have put up their prices in the time I have been with them but certainly no more than any others that I have checked. I saved  GBP37 per month changing to Utility Warehouse for joint gas and electric. 
2169|"Salesman of The Utility Warehouse Discount Club who didn't know enough about the service and the extra costs charged.  At the time, high call charges to contact the technical support team although I believe this has changed.  Extra charges for call answer service not explained at point of sale, ""free modem"" has to be returned at the end of contract, unrealistic monthly estimates at point of sale. When I did experience problems with the service it cost me more than  GBP50 in call charges to the technical support line (I believe this is now free).  Although I did claim this back after complaining, it took a while and was paid back in small amounts on a monthly basis.Broadband and call charges aren't that competitive unless you switch to UW to supply other services such as gas and electricity - my experience of their customer support stopped me from doing this An all round unsatisfactory experience - happily I have now moved away from the Utility Warehouse. All problems could have been avoided if explained properly in the first instance - because I wouldn't have proceeded."
2170|I joined with a very friendly advisor at www.bills2big.com, which is linked to the utility warehouse discount club and www.paycheapbills.co.uk and cannot recommend you try the services enough. A+ and 5 Stars all the way for Utility Warehouse.
2171|It not worth trying to save a few pounds a month switching to The Utility Warehouse Discount Club in my experience, firstly you wont be saving anything, in fact it works out a whole load more. They have a billing system whereby on paper they add all your bills into one bill, you pay a set amount which looks like you're getting a good deal. But as far as I am concerned I was not trust me I am a computer analyst and I study patterns, numbers and code for a living, I am not going to bore you with how there system works as I can't be bothered to waste any more of my time.What I can tell you is I never saved a penny switching to them, I do not recommend www.paycheapbills.co.uk.
2172|A company with average rates (despite the promise of lower costs) who I felt misled me by promises of lower prices into signing up. You can cancel the contract within 28 days but you could by then have already paid their initial GBP80 first-month fees and experience real difficulties in getting it back.  
2173|People in the senior age group with heavy phone bills and a broadband requirement must save money.  We will stick with Utility Warehouse whilst they offer free telephone calls, inexpensive line rental and Broadband. In six months we have saved GBP140 in real terms after taking into account the deficit for under charging on Gas and Electricity during the winter period.It looks as if our savings are split roughly half on the cost of Energy and half on the Telephone and Broadband.  Also, because we have four services, Telephone and Broadband count as two, all our UK land line telephone calls are FOC. On line communication/contact could be better.
2174|I have been with the utility warehouse for years as I havent been able to get out of the contract they have not yet told me when the term ends and normally give me the wrong fate and information on how to find the contract! Don't recommend because they are not cheap in my opinion.
2175|Very bad, dissapointed. I don't like anything about this company. They have a special phone number which it costs more, then the way how you have to pay them is very anoying and also the bills are very complicated. The staff can be rude.
2176|I would never recommend this company, we paid to get out of the contract. Customer services denied they had arranged a telecom engineer,  we said they did, they said they would review their taped calls and get back to us.....we haven't heard anything.
2177|Having now sold the property and awaiting a refund for overpayment of the electricity bill I continue to get letters threatening me with being put on some delinquent account register. Apparently I have to wait until some future date when they will choose to take a  meter reading to verify my overpayment.  I will not be using u/w again and I will insist that that tenants  also do not.
2178|The staff at the internet helpline and customer support are very helpful and pleasant.  Sometimes there is a wait but you are not paying for the call if you take the silver service at 59p per month.  Also if you take all the services you dont pay for phone calls anyway.  There is a free in home set up of broadband by the local agent who comes to your home to explain everything.  You can't ask for more.
2179|I have been with the Utility warehouse for a year to try them out and have been very impressed. So impressed i have become a Distributor. Cant comment on other peoples experiences only my own and those people that i have signed up myself. At the end of the day if you want to reduce your bills it is worth giving them ago. There is no minimiun contract unlike some other providers...
2180|Dont waste your time with this company - prices for electricity started low, then rocketed. customer service poor! company owe me money which i have been trying to get back for months (even after writing to top senior managers!) - no correspondence back. having to resort to trading standards to take it further!!! - leave well alone!!!!!!! - Scottish power the best.
2181|Don't even think about changing with The utility Warehouse company.  It's been trouble from day one!  There is not enough space on here to write all the negative things that I have to say.  Just leave well alone that's all I say!!!
2182|Their mobile service lets them down.Customer service is GREAT.Signed up through a local agent who is a fountain of knowledge and very helpful.
2183|Sounded too good to be true, but since joining I have calaculated have saved GBP875 on services I already had....give it a try.
2184|Not worth the hassle, prefer to pay more and be able to track faults with BT. Why do Utility Warehouse say we have to pay for routing to mobiles I thought it was a free service?  Anyway 5 days later and no rerouting done and I can't get hold of anyone to ask why not.
2185|I lived in a small apartment and was previously paying GBP100 every quarter with powergen for gas and electric.  I was assured that utility warehouse were cheaper.... once signed up my bills came through at GBP90 every month for gas and electric!  I have obviously cancelled my 'membership' with utilitiy warehouse... i have now moved to a house (much larger than my apartment) and pay GBP55 a month gas and electric (bearing in mind there is just me there).My personally experiences with utility warehouse have not been to my benefit.  I was left out of pocket and very much deflated after the promising spiel received from the convincing distributor.   
2186|I was persuaded to try them because they had good write ups in the paper and also in Which?  So far (over one year) so good.  Either they are very efficient compared to others or they are losing money.  Not my problem and long may it continue.
2187|I have 5 services with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club. Internet, Blackberry, 2 phone lines and gas and electricity. We live on the phone as both my partner and I run businesses from home.Consequently,we have heat and light and computer use all day.I would recommend this company to anyone. I am sure they have their problems but I can't think of any major ones. I did lose a line in the summer, it took 2 minutes to phone and report the whole thing but it was back in service the following day.I was with a friend the other day who was on the phone with BT for nearly 35 minutes just to get to speak with someone. I think they are switching to these people now.
2188|I thank the person who knocked on my door that day as my bills are very low and my phone is 0 a huge drop from 90 pounds a month.
2189|This company either prosper or die by word of mouth - they don't advertise.  And they seem to be growing. I've got their Gas, Electricity, Telephone and Broadband, and I'm not tied in on any of them.  I can leave if I want.  Why would I? I'm saving a raft of money, excellent customer services, and one bill for everything - and I get personal service from the person who signed me up, so I know where to turn immediately if I have a query.
2190|Joined in 2000, Free landline calls to 01 and 02 numbers, great range of products.
2191|At least one months rent down the pan and a 30 pound bill from them for nothing to top it off, an unusual way to save people money at The Utility Warehouse Discount Club
2192|Should be more flexible, not as short sited and look harder into the customer service aspect of their business; in order to help retain at least some of their existing customers. Glad to leave, would NOT recommend
2193|I was introduced to this company by one of there many representatives who, in effect, guided me through any of the problems i raised on a one to one basis; this i found to be invaluable and felt that it gave me a sense of satisfaction as i had the very same person who signed me up would get in touch with CS on my behalf and champion my cause. This took a great weight of my shoulders and left me feeling like i really was getting great value for my money and cost effective services too. i continue to have a very good relationship with my local representative and would recommend to others who have taken up the service, or who might be considering to do the same...
2194|All my utilities, electric, gas, broadband and telephone on one bill AND I get free Anytime calls to 01+02 numbers because I have 4 services. Internet Helpline is now only 5p a minute.So good that I became a Distributor!
2195|"Signed up to The Utility Warehouse Discount Club online after looking at a business opportunity card handed to me, was a small box saying ""save at home"" on home page"
2196|Would not recommend The Utility Warehouse Discount Club. Misleading literature. Savings did not exist, would have been better staying with my previous supplier.
2197|They have kept me waiting on several occasions when I needed to make changes to my account or to cancell services. When you are calling a 0871 number this can be expensive.
2198|I got really fed up with lots of bills coming in each month. I now have one bill covering SEVEN services. Saves me a lot of time in administration and bonus in that I'm saving money at the same time.
2199|All the utilities are on one bill. This is clearly laid out. Fantastic value for money with clear cut services. No fancy deals or bundles that you can't understand. Just straight forward great service.
2200|I regret joining the Utility warehouse; what should have saved me money has caused me nothing but stress and hassle.  The charges on my account is far more that what I was paying to my previous supplier (for example I was charged GBP175 for Electricity in one month although my previous spend was only GBP75 per quarter).  Six bills later and this problem has still not been resolved, I have sent numerous emails and made several phone calls and each time I was advised that a supervisor would get in touch and resolve the issues.  6 emails and over 20 telephone calls later, the issue has not been resolved.  I also had problems with my broadcall service and wasn't able to use this until 1 month of opening the account.
2201|"Their Energy Services are some of the cheapest I could find which was primarily the reason I signed up in the first place. The Broadband and home phone services are also a good deal however, don't take any of the mobile services from Telecom Plus as they are terrible value for money - really extortionate prices with huge contract lengths of up to 3 years if you want a ""free"" handset from their out of date range of phones.Customer services and general organisation are where this company really suffers though. Whenever I phoned them up, even for the simplest of requests, I would be placed on hold only for the agent to return to the phone a few minutes later and ask for my number so they could call me back. This has happened more times than I care to remember and not once did they phone back, I'd always end up having to call them back so the whole process could repeat itself again.Broadband service is not bad at all, however, if you have any problems or questions you find that telecomplus don't really know what they're doing and will advise you to call their out sourced tech support line for GBP1.50 or something per minute. This is because Telecom Plus themselves are not a Broadband supplier but merely a reseller for Mistral Internet.On the subject of Broadband, Last time I enquired about getting Broadband connected I was told that broadband service had to be paid 1 year in advance - something in the region of about GBP250. Who's going to go for that??I had so many mysterious ""credits and ""debits"" appearing on my bill - sometimes on the same bill, not even customer services can explain what they are. This is just ridiculous, one month I had GBP290 ""debit"" and then GBP276 ""credit"" on the same bill for reasons still unknown to this day. Telecom Plus have good potential, the wide range of services they offer on one bill is certainly an attractive offer, but they really need to work on their customer service department and back end systems and scrap their mobile service altogether.I left Teleocmplus in early 2007 so I suggest you do your own research and decide for yourselves. In my opinion Telecom Plus aren't that bad, they're just not that good either."
2202|The Utility Warehouse Discount Club - Good personal service is over priced by telephone centres, if you're not looking for anything special from your broadband this package is a good buy, but if you're a serious user or have more than 3 computers in your home, avoid their broadband option.
2203|The Utility Warehouse do exactly what they say on the tin. We joined in March and we have saved money on both Home and Business mobiles, gas, electricity, landlines and a freephone number. Their support is second to none. They even have a shop with free delivery. More than worth a look - with no minimum term contracts on many of the products its just worth trying!
2204|I agree with other people here - the price the Utility Warehouse people charge for internet support services is totally over the top at 75p per minute. I think this sort of rate cannot be justified, especially as they call themselves a 'club'. The broadband deal isn't even that great when compared to others. I am looking forward to switching to a much better deal on our internet as soon as our contract runs out.
2205|The Utility Warehouse take a different amount out every month, which means you don't end up owing them money or vice versa
2206|Been with Utility Warehouse for over 6 months and have nothing but problems. Very unreliable service. Broadband AND Landline down at least once a week. When I do report the problem they do fix it within a few hours but, nevertheless, it's an extremely unreliable service. They also charge an extortionate 75p a minute for their internet support. As soon as my 12 months is up, I'm switching.
2207|From having three problems with The Utility Warehouse bills I have only ever received one response in writing, I have even sent copies of my letters with the hope of getting a response....to date nothing!
2208|I joined with them at www.bills2big.com and the personal service is incredible, plus I saved money.I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
2209|We Liked it so much, we joined the company.The Utility Warehouse Discount Club service is excellent, and you are already using the product, so overall it is great!
2210|I am saving myself nearly GBP500 per year with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club.
2211|If you want to save money on your utilities this is the best club to join.  There are no lengthy contract terms for energy and landlines, and there mobile phone contract charges at GBP14.00 per month and Sim cards for just GBP8.00 per month, call charges cross network and to landlines only 8p per minute and 7p per text at all times is great value for money.  Sim cards don't have a contract period.Unless the companies energy prices rise above the big 6 key players in the market I will never take my utilities anywhere else again.
2212|The initial bills were totally wrong and inconsistent, For instance, on November's bill, they told us we were GBP32 in credit, then on December's bill, we had used GBP10 of gas and electricity. However, they had changed their minds about us being in credit and charged us GBP10. We hoped we had heard the last of The Utility Warehouse until today, when we got a letter from a debt collection agency threatening us with court action if we don't pay. After speaking to the agency, they told us Utility Warehouse had sent us a series of warning letters (we had received no letters whatsoever), and also they had called us a number of times; we have had no calls and no messages on our answerphone. And even better, the debt agency said Utility Warehouse have now put a default on my credit history.We are now with Atlantic gas and electricity, and they are a breath of fresh air after dealing with Utility Warehouse.I am usually a fair person, and this is the first time I have submitted a review anywhere, being so negative about a company. I feel it is unfair that a company can treat people like this, and I have to now waste my valuable time trying to sort this mess out.
2213|Great service, especially when you use multiple services. Utility Warehouse also offer fantastic Broadband packages!!
2214|There are lots of better deals out there. The Utility Warehouse are a so-called 'Club' who charge for membership, but they just don't have a clue how to treat their members, unless it's when you are joining them, which will be the only time they will have time to deal with your problems/queries properly.
2215|We went to Utility Warehouse for Broadband after unreliable service and exceedingly poor customer support from our previous supplier. Getting gas & electricity cheaper as well was a bonus, and then the recent new benefit of free calls according to number of services has been a bit of icing on the cake. I reckon we are comfortably saving a few hundred pounds a year, whilst getting far better service. Plus it all comes on one bill with free itemisation and very good summaries of calls, which makes my admin a whole lot easier. Can't complain!
2216|I took over a Utility Warehouse account after the death of a relative.  I cancelled phone and internet service by phone and letter, but they ignored my requests.  They sent hugely increased estimated gas and electric bills, despite no energy being used.  They promised everything would be sorted out by the next bill.  I'm 4 next bills down the line, and I have a threat of debt recovery on a GBP90 credit - work that one out!!!   This company claims to be the most profitable in Europe.  Probably because they charge 10p a minute on their helpline, but they don't answer in less than 1/2 hour.
2217|We have been a satisfied Utility Warehouse customer since 1999 (nearly seven years!) and during this time, we have saved 1000's of pounds on both our business and residential utility bills.At home, we currently take advantage of the full range of Utility Warehouse services - Gas, Electricity, Mobile, Telephone, Broadband and what I have always particularly liked is the convenience of having all of these services itemised on just one monthly bill. Paperwork is not my strong point, and the ease of one bill and one direct debit is a real plus in my books.With the Utility Warehouse telephone service, we save very well versus BT on both line rental and calls. With their mobile phone service, we have saved a fortune over the years and have always been delighted with service coverage and the 'Plain English' nature of their tariffs. On the subject of service, we have no complaints with customer service either, and note that Which? magazine recently reported the Utility Warehouse as being in the Top Three for Customer Service...ahead of all the other main brands.Finally, with gas and electricity prices going through the roof, we have opted to stay firmly with Utility Warehouse gas and electricity. Prior to the start of this recent round of price increases, The Utility Warehouse boast three years of offering the UK's cheapest energy. Early this year, they introduced a unique and innovative 'Energy Triple Guarantee' that offers a degree of security against energy price rises.We have saved 1000's over the last 6 - 7 years and remain with The Utility Warehouse.
2218|Fair value for money, but The Utility Warehouse Discount Club support and admin are not too good and the Internet service is no longer as good value as it once was.Internet service rarely delivers the speed you signed up for.  At peak times the service can be slow and is getting slower as time moves on as more people sign up.Junk the so called router sent with the package, as it filters traffic and drops the line after 4 hours continuous usage and seems to have a limit on the amount you can download.  I use a D-Link which is better, but not great.
2219|I would NOT recommend The Utility Warehouse Discount Club to any one, you are better off in the long run getting cheaper services from the big names directly. Why would any one pay a monthly fee for this service and yet not get a real significant discount compared to to other providers, better to use U Switch or one of the price comparison engines to see the best, cheapest service provider.
2220|I am using The Utility Warehouse Discount Club with 3 pcs at home - 1 desk top and 2 laptops - with a wireless network of course. Sign up was easy via Little Bills and I was connected in a matter of 7-10 days.
2221|I was after 1meg broadband, but their  were different packages of speeds, phone usage and price.  The Utility Warehouse Discount Club seemed the best value, and the speeds are perfectly adequate for my usage. I found these tailor made offers ideal. Only serious downloaders need the extra speeds.    Amazingly the site also offers cheaper gas and electricty deals, so now I will pay most of my bills on one direct debit. My workmate has 4 kids, all with mobiles and for GBP1.50 a month she gets 25% off h er monthly call costs to mobiles. Also the calls to mobiles are cheaper. She also has family abroad  and can ring them 24/7 for 2p a minute ? This company are a better all-round supplier and I can't wait to get my energy with them, they do a price checker on the web site. I cannot see any weaknesses yet and my friend is saving a fortune, she's saving enough to have an Easter Holiday break with the kids.
2222|We have a 3 bed semi, and we use loads of electric in our house.Our total bill this month for Home Phone, Internet, Electricity and Gas is a mere GBP50.04 plus VAT!.  I think this is exceptional, and I have also recently had a GBP25.53 cashback from The Utility Warehouse for my annual bonus.  Basically, the more services you take the cheaper the whole package becomes.  All so easy to keep track off with one bill!
2223|There are so many good points about The Utility Warehouse, it's difficult to know where to start...They are economical and very competitiveThey have a UK customer service base, provide a clear and concise monthly bill, have good online facilities, are listed on the London stock exchange, and they have grown and grown at a steady rate over the past few years. Never any problems! Utility Warehouse (Telecomplus) actually give money back annually to loyal customers, and my family and friends are making good savings in comparison to the services offered by others.10 OUT OF 10, NO PROBLEM.
2224|I had bad experiences of wrong charges and too high billing charges with The Utility Warehouse. Gas and Electric prices have doubled since September 2005, despite no increase in my consumption. If you phone you might listen to music a long time before anyone answers, and customer service representatives often reiterate leaving you with a feeling of frustration.
2225|The main benefit I have found with The Utility Warehouse Discount Club is the ability to talk to, or meet face to face with my local representative when anything is unclear, or if I find the customer service telephone support has left me not quite sorted.  My local guy is great, and he is very knowledgeable and helpful.
2226|The Utility Warehouse is FANTASTIC! What more can I say?I became a Utility Warehouse Discount Club customer a few months ago, and I cannot believe the amazing savings I am making, compared to my old suppliers!I did not realise that these guys are part of Telecom plus plc, who I had heard of some time ago, and they have just changed their name.I have signed-up for the whole package - gas, electricity, phone (including line rental!) and broadband. I haven't signed for the mobile yet, as I am still on a contract with O2, but I will when my contract runs out.The representative who visited me explained that, as every sales person who works for The Utility Warehouse is self employed, they do not have the same overheads as the main utility suppliers such as salaries, company cars, health insurance, and expense accounts etc. They also do not advertise anywhere, so they do not have the GBPmillions expenses that the other companies do. So, in effect, when you become a Utility Warehouse customer, you are buying at wholesale, rather than retail price (including all the overheads).Sounds like a great idea! A bit like buying your utilities from Costco or Makro, I suppose.www.u-warehouse.co.uk - highly recommended
2227|The Utility Warehouse is the company I use, but I am surprised to check other companies through the web site who all claim I can save money if I am transferred to them, but their unit charges for per KW is a lot higher. Either someone is lying, or there is a calculation error on Utility Warehouse.
2228|I have been with this company for about a year, and found there energy prices to be around 20-30% cheaper than other companies. The telphone service is great, you keep the same number and save around 20% on standard BT bills.www.utilityzone.co.uk
2229|When I recently moved house after enjoying an excellent service from NTL cable.....I was pleasantly suprised to see utility warehouse were the cheapest providers of 1mb unlimited ADSL broadband, as NTL cable is unavailable in my new area.... what I wasn't expecting was the text 'waiting in cue (#19)' for 10 minutes at peak times... fair enough, it doesn't happen all the time but this is seriously annoying when it does (and it does it alot). Infact, when I was using Tiscali 56k dial-up a few moons ago, I was getting web pages up faster than this!Having said that, this is only a problem when surfing the net(!). Downloading zip, rar and other files from the net 'do' reach there maximum speed without any problems at all.
2230|Check out The Utility Warehouse Discount Club (www.paycheapbills.co.uk) for their latest deal - 1mb deal unlimited for GBP19.95, also do 2mb for GBP24.95.Free connection and modem.
2231|Utility Warehouse (Telecom Plus) are a dreadful company do not use them.  Basically, I had a lot of trouble with my tenants not paying utility bills(they then left without a forwarding address) we had to take the tenants to court and Utility warehouse refused to believe me until i had actually sent the the ORIGINAL of our Court Order.  Then, even though the property was empty prior to selling they STILL insisted that i paid them each month.  When I asked them how much they charged for an unoccupied house they said they had no proof it WAS unoccupied.  After 2 Solicitors Letters to their Law Department they finally sent me a monthly bill of 70p (yes 70p)!!!!!  this lasted for 6 months.  When the property was finally sold, they then yet again refused to believe it had been and tried to send me a final notice.  Solicitors again!!!!!  Today we've just received another letter saying they are sorry we have left them but we need to give them a Meter Reading.  Back to the beginning again!!!!!!  Please for your own sakes do not use them
2232|  Terrible company that operates under/ with sister companies but does'nt I am sure know whats going on...   the service is almost none existant,  they do not reply to complaints or  problems  they totally ignor their own promised  gaurantees and rules  and regulations written on their  own invoices etc.,  their sister company Utility Warehouse supplied the house I moved into in July 2010 with gas & electricity but would'nt take any details from me when I contacted them in June but said I should phone in to them on moving day with meter readings & an account will be opened for me,,,  which I did I also sent the readings in the post & enclosed a letter of identification from the Estate Agent which confirmed completion/moving in day,  they would'nt accept it & I had to send the deeds of my house.   in September without prior warning & any notification they changed the 2 meters to pre-paid ones & left me without means to credit the meters for 2 weeks without hot water & heating, plus they have put a debt charge of over GBP300 on the electric meter to reimburse them for the cost of changing the meters. they say that I now owe them GBP400. but from the 2nd July to 21st September when the meters were changed my gas & electric only came to GBP51.How can this be? Why do I deserve this treatment  ? How can I become a customer for only 2 months owe GBP51 for both gas & electric  &   be in this situation  ?
2233|We have saved GBP600 in the last year and now with the fantastic Cashback card we are getting 5% off all our shopping. That's another GBP30 average a month. So savings have gone from GBP50 a month to GBP80 a month. 
2234|i was a distributor for utility warehouse and enroled people believing the lies of that company. never been paid for the work but had to invest in it. i was also a customer paid my bill every months for gas and phone line together with boradband. the broadband service was bad, no speed...the customer service was howfull and i was passing more time trying to sort out the customer i had find for them than anything else withou to be paid. everymonth the fees to be a distributor together with the buying of new leaflet and advertising for them believing it would lead me to some financial help to. when i quitted to be a customer i received a bill of over GBP900 for two months and an half usage. calling them is a waiste of time people untrained rude and not listening. would i recomend it to a friend? no maybe to my worse enemy i would. today i removed from where i used to live and have a prepay meter both for Gas and electric our family had increased from 2 people to 5 (children came to live with us) and I pay GBP10 gas per week and about GBP12 electric per week. My phone and broadband is with BT and it seems better. utility warehouse? no UTILITY worse house  
2235|"I am a customer of telecom plus--at the moment.I would like to give a word of warning to anyone considering signing up for ""Broadcall"".With this being ADSL, once you have given over your phone line to these people, should you then decide to get out of this, because, maybe your download speed is no good, you might have an unpleasant surprise.It tells you there is no Contract, and that is correct, but, there are costs.These are not insubstantial.No1 cost will be for Early cancellation--GBP502. postage costs for return of the equipment, by RECORDED DELIVERY.AND not least of all   YOU WILL LOSE YOUR LINE AND ITS NUMBER, if you do not pay them GBP99 for FIXING you up with a new line from one of their reccomended suppliers.Yes you will definitely LOSE your line and number.I have it in writing from this company. If anyone should doubt what I am telling you I am quite willing to publish the letter  on this website. With the permission of the organisers.They say it is TECHNICALY impossible to reverse the procedure without these costs. "
2236|I have my gas, electricity, landline, mobile and internet services from Telecom Plus and have done for many years.  At the end of the month I phone through my energy readings to their automated service - I much prefer to pay for what I use as I go.  Normally I'm very careful about giving the correct figures, double checking the electricity in particular as you have to read several dials.  This morning I was a little careless to say the least, misreading one figure which would have increased my apparent usage by about ten times - not what I really wanted!The wonderful thing was that the automated system wouldn't accept my figure as it was so far from normal!  It put me through to a human being in about 10 seconds who sorted the problem!!
2237|Save money, very good customer service, fast answering the phone.I'm saving a lot of money with Telecom Plus, especially now I have a cashback card
2238|In general you save more by having more services with them. I pay  GBP30 a month now for my electric as opposed to 6 months ago I was paying Eon (Powergen)  GBP64 a month and I do give monthly meter readings and it seems to be keeping on top of my usage. I got a free laptop to which is amazing and even though you do pay for the laptop somewhere along the line I still only pay  GBP27.99 a month for my Line rental, broadband and I get all landline calls free 24/7. I've also got a mobile which is contracted for 18 months I pay  GBP20 a month for this getting 180 texts or the equivalent talk time which is also a saving and if I go over my allowance I only get charged 10ppm or 10 pptext so all in all not bad. I'm not going to shout about any utility company because we all hate paying bills. But this one is the best by far because you don't notice you're paying for all your utilities because they are all on one bill. To be ultra honest I used to not pay my bills before I joined UWDC I find it a pleasure now.
2239|There is a charge for the mobile phone, you can find it in their terms & conditions. But I didn't get them until after I had applied for the service.
2240|Had a good experience with this company. My electric bill went up shortly after joining Utility Warehouse but then I checked on the prices of my old supplier and found they had gone up even more. Switching has saved me a lot of money and I like the way they have everything on one bill.
2241|Dont waste your time with this company - prices for electricity started low, then rocketed. customer service none existent.  company owe me  money which i have been trying to get back for months (even after writing to top senior managers!) - no correspondence back.  having to resort to trading standards to take it further!!! - leave well alone!!!!!!! - Scottish power the best :-)))
2242|I took over a Utility Warehouse account on the death of my brother. In 6 months I never received one bill that was near to being correct.  So I closed the account and transferred to another provider.  Now, almost a year later, I get a bill saying that the bill is GBP89.28 in credit, so I must pay Utility Warehouse GBP92.37 immediately.  I phoned their office again and was told that actually I owe GBP3.09.  Work that one out if you can?
2243|Telecom Plus is a true credit to UK companies - why can't all companies work the same way?Why don't companies realise we like personal service?
2244|If you are considering using Telecom Plus, then reconsider. Very poor service. You can hardly get any service from them even though it costs you to try and reach them (part of their low limba cts). Everyone I recommended them to, has pulled out. Never thought about it first, but learnt the hard way when I decided to pull out as a result of moving. Customers get unreliable equipment all the time. I swaped their equipment with another off the shelf after informing them that it doesn't work. They never requested for it then. Years later they are now sending me excalated charge, that was converted to 'bill', for a piece of useless equipment.
2245|One monthly billVery competitiveQuick call time to speak with the customer services teamExcellent tech support.Great company and would recommend to anyone.
2246|The home-phone, broadband and energy services of Telecom Plus aka Utility Warehouse are sold by distributors who get a slice of the action from each new punter they sign up. So the verbal pitch you'll get will be convincing stuff. Their energy price is pegged to your regional supplier, for instance, and it's undercut easily by other out-of-region suppliers. Broadband and home-phone services are not the cheapest available by a long chalk. Again, the comparison is with BT, but they supply absurd comparisons (such as the cost of a 75 minute phone call). Broadband is particularly uncompetitive.
2247|I have always got through to them very quickly - usually within 15 seconds. Try some other customer service departments and you can wait for ages. I have chopped and changed tariffs with them to gain a better discount, and I have not had any problems, except once when I was charged for a Aim card that I was not using. I contacted Telecom Plus and they refunded the money on the next bill and cancelled the Sim card.
2248|Get ALL your household utilities from Telecom Plus, The Utility Warehouse. Gas, electricity, internet, home phone plus cheap line rental, mobile phones with unlimited FREE calls and internet, all come on just one bill. Brilliant!!!
2249|I have been using Telecom Plus ( The Utility Warehouse ) for over 3 years and would whole heartedly recommend them. I have not had any problems whatsoever and have saved over GBP2,500 during that time. Telecom Plus (Utility Warehouse) provides all your utilities in one place and on just one bill with just one bill payment per month. This includes Home Phone with completely free calls to friends, Home Phone Line Rental, Mobile Phone with completely free call to friends, Cheapest unlimited ADSL Broadband, Guaranteed Cheapest Gas and Cheapest Electric. It finds the lowest trade prices for all my services and passes them onto me at wholesale prices. Most services are the cheapest I can find in the UK at any one time. The prices are updated to make sure they give the best value. Because I have all my services with them I get GBP50 Cash Back at the end of the year on top of being the cheapest overall anyway. It can continue to always provide the best value because there is no advertising and no sales people. This is unlike existing monopoly providers that spend millions on advertising the cost of which ends up being passed directly onto existing customers in higher prices. Instead it relies on referral from existing customers to their friends and family. Who then like myself have started using all the services and recommended it to all their friends. Because it is all in one place it is more cost effective and so the savings continue to be passed to all existing customers, not just special deals for new customers like other companies. In fact it has been doing so well using this simple method that it has been voted overall as Europe's Fastest Growing company over the past 4 years by European Business Magazine. Last Year it was voted the 3rd fastest growing company in the UK by The Independent on Sunday. It is also very profitable and so can again continue to pass on the savings. The only way you hear about it is either through the many excellent reviews in national publications like the Financial Times  The Which, The Independent on Sunday etc or through existing customers who recommend to their friends. The customer service is excellent. It is provided from the UK unlike other companies I have used before and the customer service staff are expertly trained to also provide support for all your utilities and in one place. It is also fully UK owned as well. Most other companies are foreign owned in the utilities market even ones you would think were British.I would seriously consider using Telecom Plus ( The Utility Warehouse ) since because of the way the company is structured it can continue to always give the best value. It is the ONLY Company in the UK or Europe for that matter that provides a fully integrated bill for all your services. I certainly would not consider going elsewhere even if a flashy advert came on TV or a Salesperson knocked on my door. Why pay more...I would heartedly recommend having a look at their website. It is very simple to use just like the company itself.
2250|Telecom Plus is a one stop shop for all your utility needs.  They don't advertise, they market through a team of distributors.  Their sim only deal value call is excellent.  They have just been voted Europe's fastest growing company.
2251|Honest up front and the only thing stopping people getting the services is the lack of exposure that the company has due to keeping the prices so low and the cheapest for dual gas/electric.  The services are improving and I have just got holiday insurance from them too. Great company.
2252|I have 4 contracts with TelecomPlus. They have changed contracts, OVERCHARGED me and refused to refund overcharges.  They Charge GBP20 for a PAC code to move Mobile phone service, Take months to respond to written requests.  I would suspect having checked the reviews already listed that these are distributors for this company. My recomendation is to get an honest Mobile and Landline supplier, I have.
2253|I have saved hundreds of pounds using www.telecomplus.co.uk on Gas, Telephone, Electricity and Broadband and the distributor was very helpful. There is no pain in moving and all services appear on 1 clear monthly bill which helps with budgeting. I found them through www.lowcostutilities.co.uk
2254|I have been a telecom plus customer for 10 months. In that time I have saved in the region of GBP420 on my phone Gas and Electric bills. I have even saved GBP100+ per year on my broadband costs.There were no problems at all switching over from previous suppliers and the fact that I now receive and pay just one bill makes the whole headache of paying bills disappear. I would have no hesitation of recommending their services to anyone.
2255|Telecomplus have saved me over GBP400 since I started on their services. The distributor who signed me to these services was always on the end of the phone to help me if I had a query and contacted customer services on my behalf if needed. I would recomend Telecomplus to anyone who wishes to save money all round.And I have done so in the past.This is where I found out about it:http://www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk/store/index.taf?exref=927442
2256|Telecom Plus - Everything went smoothly when transferring my gas and electricity supply and, because they operate through a network of independent distributors, I have a personal contact as well as the usual call centre.I had a real chance to consider the changeover when I got a quote on the savings that I stood to make, based on past usage. Together with the quote they sent the contract for me to sign if I was happy with it.Telecomplus sent me a number of letters to keep me updated on the progress of the transfer, but these took a little effort to decipher on occasion.
2257|Telecom Plus is agood company with no hidden extras.  Everything clear.
2258|I've been enjoying cheap phone calls as a customer of TelecomPlus for 5 years now and am very happy with the service (plus I have saved more than GBP500 on my phone calls. :o)  ).Over this time I can't think of one solitary problem I've had. I can always get a line, the bills arrive, regular as clockwork, on the 14th of each month and the correct amount is debited 2 weeks later (so I have plenty of time to make sure there's enough in the account).I was a bit worried at first because I use the same phone line for our internet conection and I didn't want our connection to suffer. It hasn't been a problem - the smart box recognises the number is a special rate number and diverts it through to BT with no reduction in connection speed.I signed up through a colleague at work but you can also sign up online without any fuss - the company does not employ reps to pester you and only sells through a network of individual resellers.The website can be a bit offputting - it asks for direct debit details and GBP10 up front. The GBP10 is only used to carry out a credit check (I guess this is why the calls are so cheap) and is deducted from your calls.I have to confess I have been so impressed that after all these years I recently joined up as a reseller. I've included a direct link for more information below and I hope those helpful people at Reviewcentre won't mindcheap phone calls at TelecomPlus
2259|She was a brilliant help. Really efficient and professional! Love this service. Made things very easy and was better than being on the phone! A lot more practical.
2260|Every time you contact Spark they're always promptly available, super friendly and know exactly all the answers to your questions. The adviser was the most helpful - sorted out my direct debit in a matter of seconds and informed my previous supplier about the cut off meter reading which they got wrong. Very refreshing to deal with such a great Customer Service.
2261|I'm a new tenant in a property and had arrears in the electricity key. I used the online chat and the very helpful person sorted everything out for me really easily and efficiently. Would definitely recommend. I really liked the ease of it all and the politeness or the representative.
2262|The customer service advisor was very fast to respond to my query. I didn't have to wait in a que, and was speaking to an advisor within a few seconds. Scott was quick to resolve my billing query, and overall it was probably the easiest experience of dealing with a utility company or  any large corporation that I've had. I would definitely use the online chat service again. Excellent customer service.
2263|OH and I recently moved into a rented property, we notified our old supplier, gave them all the required info and they told us they were to undertake a meter reading on the new property, well, this never happened,but we were totally unaware of this as the electricity supply was fine. We had rec'd post from a company called Sparks, just addressed to the 'Tenant',  thinking this was junk mail, we had been returning it, a web search revealed who Saprks are, and an online chat got everything sorted in a few minutes, the  young man was very efficient, checking the national data base to find out who was our supplier, setting us up a new account and bringing everything up to date, so days of worries had been resolved in a few minutes. Seems like our old supplier's incompetence has done us a favour in the end. Thank you to the operator who handled my query, I really appreciated your help.  
2264|Kaye has been great and had an answer to all my questions. Thank you for your help and patience. :)
2265|Spark offer good straightforward value for money.  It takes about 10 minutes or more to get through on the phone but the advisors are very courteous and efficient. I have to ring every quarter to download a bill as their system does not do this automatically for some reason but  they are very fair and, if a large credit builds up ,a partial refund and downward adjustment in direct debit is suggested.  Very happy with my new supplier. Have been with Spark for a year now.
2266|I didn't have a very good experience with Spark when it was forced upon me by my landlord. They took over 20 minutes to answer the phone. But it seems they are now a company that listens to their customers. They answer the phones very quickly, always call back when they say they will they even offer a free number that is included in my mobile phone tariff that i can call free of charge. The live chat is excellent I've always had a great experience.The only thing i would like them to change is the way they produce their bills. I still don't understand how much I owe. I've seen a system that SSE use where you enter your meter read and instantly it tells you how much you owe. I would really benefit from that so that i know when to use my heating or spend the evening round the parents taking advantage of their warm house.Spark you have had your flaws but now you are one of the best energy companies I have had dealings with. All i ask is that you re review how you bill people. If i could see in real time how much i actually owe Id be able to plan for the month or when you review the direct debit on our accounts. I would also like to suggest that when you re review our direct debits you base it on the last 6 months as apposed to the system you use currently.
2267|excellent and fast callback service. friendly and knowledgeable advisor, query resolved quickly and efficiently. thank you.
2268|This is by far the best energy company to deal with.When I moved house I changed supplier.Everyone on a comparison site was more expensive.I Had to contact Spark twice by phone and also tried the live chat.All three times the was no waiting, no diversions, no putting on hold, direct to the person who could answer my questions and helpful, friendly advice.Best energy company I have ever dealt with by a million miles.A credit to what most people regard as a difficult industry.Keep it up and they have a customer for life!
2269|I contacted Spark last week to close my account My account was showing I owed GBP400. I had been making monthly Direct Debits which dare I say were increased by Spark by GBP100.00 a month to GBP260. I then was told today that I now owe GBP700.
2270|"Having been with Spark for a number of years, i was so disappointed when i received an email saying my direct debit was going up by GBP20.12 per month. Obviously i rang them to say i think there has been a mistake, my account was GBP443.12 in CREDIT why do they want to charge me more, had reply ""the system we use says so"". Spoke to three different people in the 40 minute phone conversation who all said exactly the same, so I asked them to REDUCE my Direct Debit, this I was told could not be done as the system says you should be paying more.Used a web caparison site to find better rate, found i could save GBP22.00 per month, based on the figures from Spark for yearly consumption. Cancelled Spark and swapped to other company on 3rd December 2014, have rung and rung and chased to get my GBP440 BACK from Spark, eventually got refund on 10th MARCH. In essence all goes well for a while but trying to get some sense out of the kids on the phone is a nightmare, constant exscuses, No -one takes control of problem and you can NEVER speak to same person, i have 14 DIFFERENT Names for just the accounts Dept."
2271|I have enjoyed my time as a customer of Spark Energy. I have always felt in control of my bills thanks to the online service and they have always been responsive to any queries. The live chat service is excellent for a quick resolution to queries.
2272|I have been trying to see my gas bill online for nearly 9 months but still it is not there. It means I can't submit a meter reading and there are no bills. I complained about this a few weeks ago and got told it was fixed but it is clearly not.
2273|Call centre staff were friendly and helpful,however I feel that Spark Energy is one of a growing group of suppliers who are abusing their power to trick customers. I understand the policies but believe it is ridiculous not to notify customers when they are overpaying by substantial amounts over a period of time and then to keep that money for over a month before refunding. Please take this complaint on board and do not reply with an explanation of what policies are in place.....I understand them but don't agree with them. I will be looking elsewhere for a new supplier.
2274|I rang today as I was considering a change of supplier.One of the menu options was to receive a callback once my call reached number one in the call queue.I did this with trepidation as with so many large companies this could stretch to a week or not at all. Callback came within 5 mins. !!!!I was dealt with in a really pleasant and helpful manner and reached an arrangement as satisfactory as others on the comparison website (minus the GBP30 cashback of course),but to my mind worth it for the quality of their customer services.
2275|We had an issue with charges on our bill that spark after a quick phonecall with no long delays were happy to sort out. Very efficient service.
2276|Online chat Very quick response, very helpful, and my issue resolved in minutes.Thank you
2277|Great personal experience, I was very happy with the level of service I received and also being offered different options was a great first impression. I was made to feel like an individual rather than a number and was thoroughly satisfied that the person I spoke to was knowledgeable and very helpful. What a great asset to your company this man is and made a fantastic first impression. 
2278|I received a very helpful professional clear service from Spark Energy and would be prepared to recommend them as an energy provider.  
2279|I think the service was ridiculous I was owed GBP400 from over paying and I have been trying to get this back since November we are now going in to feb and they are still telling me it will be another 28 working days what a joke this is not acceptable and I will be advising people to stay well away from spark energy 
2280|Have been in touch with spark over the phone, as I have recently moved into a property and for some reason previous tenants haven't switched the gas over, or even told me who it is, which caused quite a bit of confusion on my side. Staff at spark had a poke around to see whatsup and gave me a clear rundown of what is going on and who is the current gas supplier, now I can actually contact em and get all moved over to Spark.
2281|I will never be using or recommending spark for the following reason. After Charging for the wrong address spark have completely fobbed me off at every turn. The staff seem friendly while on the phone, as soon as I hang-up nothing seems to be done. Agreements have been made and broken, and every time I call they say it has been escalated, and on the next call? that's right, they don't even know I have a problem. It is absolutely ridiculous, as a HCAI work long hours and for the past few months have been spending all off my free time chasing them for a poxy GBP180. It is time, I believe for legal proceedings.
2282|I thought the advisor I spoke to was very friendly and helpful. When he didn't know the answer to my question he asked his colleague and was more than happy to answer as many questions as I had. He explained things to me clearly and had a friendly manner
2283|Have been building up credit on our account so we had over GBP500 in credit. We e-mailed Spark on 3 occasions without any useful response. I noticed the web chat and contacted them via that. SR took the call and agreed to revise our Direct Debit and return the GBP566 excess in the next 28 days or less. The call was handled very efficiently  and hopefully we will get our over payment refunded as promised. If only we had had service like that in the past.Sparks bills are not the easiest to understand!     
2284|The gentleman i spoke to was informative and more than willing to take the time to talk me through the different options available to me as a new customer. He was very polite and friendly and setting up a direct debit was swift and hassle free. Excellent service. 10/10. would employ 
2285|Initially I had great reservations about the service Sparks provides as my ex boyfriend had dealt with the electricity bill (failing to change it from my name to his after this flat's management agency had forwarded my name t Sparks without my permission) beginning of last year and didn't realise that the low direct debit payments were not covering the usage costs. Ok so the website wasn't clear and we were not informed of the increasing build up of debt so I feel there was fault on both sides. If I had realised this I would have paid more and changed to a company with a lower day rate. I had a great shock when he moved out to find out the debt was over GBP1400.This issue was eventually resolved with a new direct debit plan and as much as this is a nightmare situation for me, at every stage I felt listened to and was treated with courtesy. Again today I called Sparks to give my meter readings and spoke to a friendly and professional member of staff. I have been with many different companies over the years and their customer service has not been as good. Also, as much as I had to wait for my call to be answered this was under 5 minutes which again is less than other services I have experienced. I would recommend Sparks to my friends if they feel the rates are competitive.
2286|Concise & very helpful telephone conversation & she sorted all my queries.
2287|As a Landlord with 42 properties I deal with most of the utility companies regularly therefore I have sampled the vastly differing service levels from the extremely poor (1 out of 10) to excellent (10 out of 10)Spark is 9 out of 101. Quick to answer 2. Will call you back if you dont want to wait3. The Staff are able to deal with all aspects of the process (this is extremely important. It is infuriating to explain the full issue to someone only to be transferred to another operator/deparment to whom you have to explain again.)
2288|Takes me a long time to type. Best service ever.
2289|having been trying to sort out this situation since september your operative The man I dealt with has been the only person to be helpful. he was polite, sympathetic (which i might tell you goes a long way when you have been trying to get somethig sorted out for as long as i have) and above all did something. i know i was not supposed to use a name but in this case felt compelled to.
2290|Really helpful, answered most of my questions without me even having to ask. Very attentive and helped to explain the tariffs to me to help me decide how to amend my account. Wasn't pushy at all like some companies can be, just gave me my options and said I could take my time to decide.Was really pleased, I've called x3 times in the past week to sort out quite a complicated issue with my account and each time I've come off the phone feeling happy and with all the information I need.
2291|Spoke to a new staff member tonight, who was extremely helpful and was able to quickly answer my query. Offered to call me back in a few weeks to let me know on progress with the transfer of provider which I found helpful and conscientious. Excellent service, cant wait to get transfered back to Spark following a recent house move.
2292|Very professional and friendly customer service staff. Caanot ask for more. issue delt with speed.
2293|Assistant on the phone was super helpful with a great telephone manner, Spark are good, it feels like they are a new company finding their feet but that's OK. Prices are good with options for various plans. I wish I new when my economy seven begins and ends daily and I wish the bills had more information about my personal usage and less info that doesn't relate to me. Apart from that as long as their prices remain competative I intend to stay with Spark. 
2294|I called Sparks energy customer services and was answered straight away. The representative was helpful and friendly and my query was sorted out within a few minutes. 
2295|this 5 star is for the Lady that helped me today. She did exactly what I wanted with my bill. This is the first time I have contacted spark and was dealt with like a customer not having to complain. This means I will be staying with spark for the foreseeable future but if I get customer service like that again my recommendation will turn to a 'yes'. I was able to keep my direct debit down by GBP80 per month!!! on what spark wanted to set it at. I will hold final judgement until I get my updated bill!! as mistakes have been made in the past......but optimistic. 
2296|Spark energy have very friendly staff who are easy to talk to and explain things in direct and simple terms.They are reassuring and have helped me to create a tariff that best suits my personal situation.The online account is easy to navigate and they have a callback system so you don't have to be on hold for ages on your weekend or lunch break.
2297|i had to contact customer services and my query was dealt with by a gentlemen  who was very friendly and extremely helpful.  His attitude to me as a customer was excellent and he dealt with my query politely and efficiently.  In all I would say that the treatment I received was second to none.
2298|Great service and both the Contact centre and website are helpful and easy to use.Easy to log a meter reading and staff are pleasant and extremely helpful.Definately recommend.
2299|Each quarter I get a standard letter from Spark stating that my monthly direct debit is to increase from GBP75 to around GBP180. This is clearly ridiculous as, based on meter readings, the direct debit I pay should give me a 'cushion' through the winter. At first I thought it was to do with a back-dated muddle about meter readings. But no - it transpires that the onus is on the customer to provide monthly meter readings, otherwise this 'standard' estimation is used. The customer service staff member I spoke to today explained how the system works and he took me through a process that came up with a reasonable figure for the direct debit (for now). I also discovered today that the person who comes to read the meter does not tell Spark what the readings are - I still have to do that every month to prevent Spark arbitrarily hiking my direct debit by 240%. Go figure...The guy I spoke to was friendly, polite and clear. He also listened very well and had buckets of empathy. He called me back to save my phone bill (really thoughtful).  I can only imagine the outpouring of anger and frustration that he must receive due to Spark's customer-unfriendly systems and my heart goes out to him.  It is solely because of him that I am not switching to another provider today. I am not somebody who goes for a supplier based purely on cost - I value environmentally friendly energy (Spark, as I understand it, is doing okay here); I also value customer service and, despite the helpful staff, I think that Spark may lose this customer based on their insane and unfair direct debit system. 
2300|I am very annoyed with your staff as he did not ring me what we agreed . I have not done anything for that hour. It cause me a lot of frustration and inconveiEnce . 
2301|Special thanks to the adviser, he was so helpful with great advice setting me up as a Spark Energy Customer.
2302|I needed help with an account as the previous account holder had passed away. The rep that helped me was truly amazing! He was so kind and helpful. He couldn't do enough. I'm extremely happy with the service that I have recieved today and couldn't have asked for a better rep to help assist me. I would be happy to recommend spark energy to anyone purely based on the customer service they provide.  A professional and polite phone call that has left me completely satisfied and made things a bit easier. Thank you 
2303|Fantastic service, very helpful and understanding staff member. 
2304|incredible customer service .. well done
2305|I contacted spark with a query about a bill they had sent me. The person I spoke to was fantastic, very polite and helpful. She soon sorted out my query and made my day. Excellent customer service. I wish I could remember her name, she is a great asset to spark energy.
2306|Just wanted to say the man I dealt with was very helpful with regards upgrading to Economy 7 tariff, it was a very personal service and i like the fact that he emailed me direct from his email, so i have a 1 to 1 experience, this is good. He took his time to make sure the facts he was giving me were correct and i am now waiting to hear when the meter can be changed. Good customer service all round.
2307|The Lady I spoke to was fantastic, I have everything sorted in a good amount of time, she was patient with me and explained everything that was need. I would recommend this to anyone!
2308|I had a bumpy start with Spark (I had heard they had a bumpy start all round).  However, I have just come to the end of my first year with them and have saved GBP450 this year. The only annoying thing is that you pay  in advance, so when you sign up it's quite expensive (2 months out at once). Just had really helpful conversation with their call centre, who refunded the stonking GBP450 credit on my account straight away.Pretty impressed all round. 
2309|An excellent member of staff 
2310|ALL THREE ELEMENTS ARE FIRST RATE. EVERY TIME I CALL I COME AWAY SATISFIED WITH THE OUTCOME. ONLY HICUP IS NOT GETTING BILLED WHEN I SUBMIT METER READINDS OUTWITH THE TIME THEY ARE REQUESTED
2311|Having joined Spark a few years ago I was more impressed with their pricing then their service levels.However these service levels have improved beyond recognition. Calls are alwasy amswered quickly and efficiently and staff have instant access to account details and answer/resolve questions in a very friendly and efficient manner.Cheaper and better than the competition!!
2312|I ahve used Spark Energy for approximately 3 years now. They always have very competitive prices and their on-line live chat customer service is amazing.I recently moved house and took Spark with me. They sorted everything out with the switch and I even got a refund on the energy I had paid for on the old property but had not used. Everything went very smoothly.An honest, reliable company whose customer service team are willing to help.Would definitley recommend this energy provider.The online chat function is great if you don't have a lot of time to make a call. The operators are prompt in connecting with you and can sort out any issues directly from the online chat.Overall, a great supplier
2313|glad that my problem of spark energy changing my tariff without my notification eventually got solved. The customer service agent was friendly and extremely helpful and called back when the line dropped, which saved me having to constantly explain my situation again and again to other member of the team. Great customer service! 
2314|I cannot say anymore, the level of customer services is nearly unbelievable, outstanding. The politeness and level of staff training is quite astonishing. Thanks, Adam.
2315| The lady I dealt with was great as I was terrible at doing energy bill stuff. Thanks spark you are really great.
2316|The customer service I brilliant and very prompt. Would recommend as a energy supplier. The only problem is no customer service on Sundays 
2317|Having had solar paneling installed I contacted Spark Energy about the procedures for arranging the Feed in Tariff. It was easy and dealt with efficiently in a friendly and helpful manner.
2318|Clearly explained all the state of my bill and the best way to move forward, allowed tailoring to fit my requirements but quickly setting up payment for the future. Friendly and clear.Unfortunately took quite awhile to get through on the phone, on website said wait time was 5 mins but in reality took 20 mins.
2319|After checking my account using the iPhone app I was able to have my direct debit reduced and a refund generated with the help of a vey efficient and courteous operative. My only disappointment is that this was not done by Spark Energy without my having to request it. Spark Energy are probably making a fortune from the interest on money that does not belong to them! 
2320|Hi in brief, when I called I was considering leaving. I DID NOT MENTION THIS to the person I spoke to. I only mentioned my problem. He was very understanding, took the time to help me, and provided me with a contact point, and e-mailed a summary of the agreed plan. I never mentioned this to the advisor, but following the phone call i decided to stay with spark energy. I believe he is a perfect example of how I expect a good customer service, and he should be appreciated
2321|I went to the online chat this morning and I know you say not to mention names, but I do want to give credit to Scott.  He was welcoming and so helpful with my enquiry, he wanted to help me to the best that he could and he absolutely did that! I always get stressed and put off dealing with company's as I always find the customer service is rubbish and no one wants to help, neither understands or cares what situation you are in, but Scott cared today and I am very grateful of that and to top it off he saved me some money too, sometimes you just need to talk to the right person to change your views on the customer service and Scott did that today! So thanks Scott! Very much Appreciated! 
2322|The live text chat service is great. The guy that dealt with my enquiries was really helpful and efficient. His initials were SR.
2323|We had been passed onto Spark without our knowledge by our letting agency.  I rang and spoke to a man at Spark who explained why this had happened.  He said he would put in a request for this to be resolved as an Erroneous Transfer under the circumstances (which I won't bore you with).  He has done this and it has all been sorted within a matter of hours, if that.   Would give it a 5 star rating except we have not actually used Spark so cannot really comment.  5 star customer service though on today's showing.
2324|Great customer service. Never had an issue whenever I need help or advice. Just spoke to very helpful member of staff using the chat function on the website - initials SR. Have also been helped very quickly and thoroughly.
2325|We use Spark Energy for our buy to let property.  Since October 2014 they have charged us a monthly late payment fee every month, when we have always paid our bills on time. After 3 phone calls and 1 complaint letter (which by the way was supposed to be responded to within 2 days and has not been!) they have done it again with latest bill.  Very disappointed - the customer service team are very helpful and always take action when we call however, we should not have to be making these calls in the first place.  Angry and frustrated and if property wasn't about to be sold we would switch supplier immediately. 
2326|The man I spoke to was wonderful, very friendly and professionl. The world would be a fantastic place if everyone was so nice. 
2327|SR was very helpful, professional, and quick. My problem was resolved and though I haven't always had the best experiences with Spark, this chat encounter made me feel a lot better about their service.
2328|Very helpful, sorted out what I needed quickly and spoke like a real person. Gave good advice and was a pleasure to deal with. This is my first account with Spark and I'm very impressed with the service and communication so far!
2329|SR (Scott)Happy that my problem has been resolved. Operator friendly and helpful, thank you.
2330|Scott was very helpful in getting to the bottom of my problem.
2331|No need to Waite long for live chat to talk like any other companies you stuck on your laptop waiting and waiting. Nice and clear talking customer advisor , i wish all customers services have people like that  
2332|subbmitting a meter only had errors spoke to SR on live chat, very helpful and polite got it sorted in no time
2333|SR was very helpful and efficient and resolved our refund issue.
2334|My wife and I recently moved and we started to receive double billings from two providers.  We choose SparkEnergy, but our old carrier kept billing us.  I tried to contact the old carrier and I was told they would get back to me within 5 days!  Instead, I was able to talk to Scott (SR)online immediately and he gave me answers straight away, very nice gent.  It was very nice to receive helpful, accurate, and friendly service!
2335|Through an error by an estate agent that I had began renting a flat from, I recieved a brief notelet from 'Spark' out of the blue, informing me of their taking over the utilities supply to my home.Having never heard of them I actually phoned their help line initially thinking they must be a part of one of the existing power suppliers that I had previously signed up with.The first agent I spoke to was particularly unhelpful - giving the impression of 'the computer says this, so that's all that can be done'. Not impressed with the negativity, I forced the point that there was a clear mistake here. The best I could establish was to send an email from the estae agent explaining the error and that the supply would remain with my current suppliers. Requesting, I was told Spark would then send me confirmation of them not taking over the supply.However this communication never arrived and indeed I later recieved notifications from my suppliers of my decission to leave their services(!)Phoning 'Spark' again (3 days before the switch date) and expecting the same negative attitude - I was pleasently surprised to be treated in the complete oposite! The agent I spoke to was understanding, appologetic and sympathetic to the situation! More over, confirming that my prev contact had basically never been acted on, she was able to quickly and stresslessly remidee the problem. Confirming the erronious supplier switch would not occur and was cancelled: she following it up with a clear confirmation email explaining what she had done. How easy was that!If all Sparks agents were as personable as her may get to hear from me again. In reality the initial negativity is hard to forget...
2336|its a great way to stay in contact without having to deal with a phone
2337|Very friendly and helpful, we will look into using their service in the future
2338|3 days and countless telephone conversations with several customer service representatives later! It's a long story and hard to condense, but here goes...I had problems with my storage heaters not turning on and off automatically after switching to Spark. This cost me more in one weekend than I would normally pay for the week - all to do with day rates and economy 7.Sparks call back policy was efficient and staff were all very pleasant and helpful: except for the initial conversation with a representative who I felt wasn't listening to my problem and told me to get an electrical engineer. Which I did, and no problems with the heaters, as I suspected!I called again and again, Spark eventually worked out the problem, and I felt such relief that I was right in what I had been trying to tell them, unfortunately, the main problem was incorrect information stored on the database. Not good! But neither Sparks or my fault!I am pleased to say the problem has now been resolved and I have also been reimbursed with the money I lost. Thank you to those involved, a happy ending :)
2339|Read a number of negative reviews before contacting Spark to process a refund, as my account balance was high, based on obviously inaccurate estimates when set up. Logged onto live chat, within 5 minutes my payments were halved and there was a chunky refund on the way to me. Literally couldn't imagine a better service. Only reason I can think of for the negative reviews is that the email and phone service is slow and awkward, but the experience via the livechat platform has been great. Highly recommended. 
2340|"Whatever you do don't let yourself get into the situation where Spark are estimating your bills.They have consistently over estimated my bills by a factor of four.Despite months of correspondence pointing out to them that the ""industry standards"" that they use are simply wrong they persist in using ""industry standards"" rather than the comprehensive evidence of the actual meter readings that they have had for a period of well over a year.I suppose it would be like Ford quoting vehicle performance using Formula 1 ""industry standards"" and quoting the top speed for a Ford Focus as 250mph!!"
2341|im not very good with computers put withs sparks live chat it was brilliant. i had a problem yaesterday and a lovely lady went out her way to sort it out but by today it still hadnt been sorted so the same lovely lady went out her way to help me again to today and finaly got it sorted she is a dimand now me and my children are going to have a warm future thanks to no names mentioned (d#b##e) now you i no you have live chat i have more confidence in reporting my problems
2342|The online account is simple and the chat function lets you get answers to queries quicker and more conveniently than calling in.  Very professional and easy to deal with.
2343|Spoke to a lady online, she was very courteous & efficient. She understood the query, asked simple clear questions, laid out my options and helped me pick the best one. It saved me money and took just a couple of minutes. First rate!
2344|I contacted the company with regard to a large increase in my direct debit and was there anything I could do about it.  I was informed there had been a blip in system and the information I had received did not ring true.  I was rang back and informed that it had be sorted out due to a computer error I was quoted the wrong amount and there would not be a huge increase after all.  The member of staff who dealt with my phone call was very professional and confident, I was put at ease right away, thank you.   
2345|I had received an email stating my direct debit needed to be increased by a substantial amount, concerned about this and how I could pay I contacted the company.  The outcome was in my favour due to a computer hitch, the operator concerned contacted me after it was resolved with a very professional and confidant manner, which reassured me no end.I would recommend the company to all my friends and family, because of your fair pricing and excellent customer service.Thank you.
2346|I tried to enter meter readings but couldn't, so I emailed them. It was picked up and they noticed I had a large credit amount. Spark Energy VOLUNTEERED to reduce the monthly direct debit until the credit was eliminated and then it would be re-established at a lower rate. For me, this is a first. I was going to ask for a refund, but I moved from previous supplier because they treated it like a one way ratchet up, up and up again.
2347|SR was very helpful and understanding, and he solved my problem quickly. 
2348|dealt with my query very quickly and made the necessary changes to the accountefficient and politemany thanks
2349|just used your chat line spoke with aguy called CT great service thought iwould give credit where due as i am not slow in moaning about sloppy poor service
2350|Scott, the advisor who helped me with the issues I was having was incredibly helpful, quick and friendly. I was really impressed as he helped me to not only understand and update my bill but adjusted my direct debits to help me make some savings. He was very friendly and ensured that all of my concerns were addressed before the end of our conversation. It's the first time that I have come across a customer service advisor whose performance has impressed me enough to leave a review so managers, take note!(Initials of advisor: SR)

2352|I couldn't have asked for a more helpful person to speak to, I've never had to deal with gas or electric bills before in the past and he made it so easy, and so personal. It wasn't a chore to sort it out, it was interesting and I was 100% happy with the service. The key element for me was the price, It was cheaper than other competitors, and so easy to set-up. I would definitley recommend to a friend. The man I dealt with was very knowledgeable and polite, formal but made me feel really comfortable to speak too.  
2353|This little window of Live Chat is why I chose Spark and why I recommend it to my peers. You are not bothered at all to get to your power supplier and sort any problem. To be honest the fact that I should wait behind the line to talk to an operator for a simple problem gets on my nerve sometimes, thanks to Live Chat no more waiting.
2354|I moved into my new property on 7th July 2014. Spark Energy being the supplier of both Gas and Electricity. My dealings with Spark Energy have been very cordial and efficient.They are a smaller company and it has been very pleasant to have a phone call answered by a human being rather than having to stumble through my previous suppliers labyrinthine call centre.I had to contact them a number of times due to my precious supplier not accepting that I had left them. At all times I have found the staff extremely friendly and professional.
2355|I was spoken to by SR on the live chat function you have on your site (always a great way to contact companies) and within minutes I was set up and ready to go with the cheapest tariff and a direct debit which is to be reviewed in 3 months time to make sure I don't get overcharged (something that happens quite a lot these days when energy is concerned)The afore mentioned advisor was friendly and helpful and made setting up with Spark really simple, also setting up online for me too!As of yet I am only reviewing from a new customer point of view and as of yet I have had no problems, I hope this doesn't change as I continue to be a Spark customer.
2356| was really helpful with all of my queries :) 
2357| I spoke to scott (SR). He wasvery friendly and provided a thorough and helpful service. all my questions were answered and they put me at ease with regards to my concerns.
2358|I was contacting spark today, to speak to them about my account and the way I want to pay my bills.I actually went on to chat with an employee, who was very helpful and quick to the task to complete my enquiry.All in all, Spark energy has a very good costumer service.
2359|I am a new customer and had a few questions so went to the website. It stated that there was an 8 min wait for the phone so I used the online chat. It was excellent! Very polite operator, gave me all the information I needed quickly and saved me on the phone bill! Excellent service! 
2360|I used the LiveChat function with (CT) at SparkEnergy and had a very efficient and accurate conversation regarding meter readings, estimates vs. actual costs of energy and the re-assessment of my direct debit payments.Every question was answered quickly and accurately, which provided an excellent service from this energy provider.
2361|I had a conversation earlier with DB, she was very prompt and helpfull. Thank you!
2362|SR was very good, so kind and patient and very helpfull.He helped me with ny moving and balance.Very good
2363|Very good company i will recomend it to everyone. Thank you
2364|I very rarely comment online on anything, however, the spark energy staff are so good I have to.  I have had friendly chats every time, that didn't feel like a chore. When I have made a reasonable request it has always been listened to and taken care of. This doesn't sound like praise but it is. Compare spark with the council tax and the difference is night and day. Thank you to the management for recruiting well and mostly thank you to your team for working with me not against me. It is very appreciated.
2365|Very helpfull staff had very fast answer
2366|It was actually an enjoyable experience. It felt like customer service for a change rather than a mandatory facility. I didn't have to hold long for someone to answer and when they did it was almost like talking to someone I knew. The problem was resolved really quickly and everything was explained thoroughly. With other companies I would be so frustrated by the end of the call but tonight I left the call feeling happy. Its about time customer service was just that in this country and you guys are doing it perfectly. Thank you. 
2367|Quick and easy to use interactive serivce which saves me the phonecall costs. I was very happy with technical support gentleman. He asked me relevant questions which I could answer.The problem was acknowledged and I was assured I would dealt with. However not so happy that it was about non issuing of bills which could cost me more than planned.
2368|The adviser was very helpful towards me, quick to the point and got me what I wanted immediately. Got my refund to me in 2 or 3 working days which is way better than the standard 28 days as I need to pay rent. He understood completely and there was no confusion at all. I would like it if he was rewarded as I believe he is an upstanding worker and benefits customers regularly as he has me today. Thank you for reading this. I sincerely hope you take this review into account as he deserves to be rewarded. I will recommend service from the live chat line from here out due to my conversation with him as I have been made feel serviced to the max. I know it was a short and precise conversation but after all its the little things that matter in life is it not ? But anyway enough waffling, I really do think he should get some sort of reward for this. Thank you for reading and goodbye :)
2369|It's good customer service, via live chat, but costs too much a month. Every other month I would get an email and a letter through the post advising my bills were increasing by silly amounts but I live on my own and only ever burn 1 light bulb, a TV and perhaps a laptop/computer at any given time yet they wanted to charge me GBP75 a month, at one point. Far too much for such little electric, especially when I live on my own. 
2370|I found Spark to be very helpful indeed, but, always use Live Chat to get things done!  A great way to save time, during business hours.  I had trouble closing my account due to a house move, till I did this; BT was the operator I suggest you ask for, if you experience any slowness or inefficiency at all.  I was online perhaps 2 min and all sorted.  Very happy customer.
2371|I spoke to a lovely person on your chat who helped me out massively. She explained everything I needed to know and couldn't understand so well. I'm glad to have everything sorted now and wouldn't have been able to get to grips without her. Thanks!!
2372|Staff where very helpful with any queries I had, and helped resolved any issues  
2373|The adviser was very helpful throughout our conversation and dealt with my inquiry in the smoothest possible way :)
2374|I moved into a property where the previous tenants were using Spark Energy. I wished to continue to use Spark but found it impossible to speak to a human being on the phone. I came home early for two nights in a row to speak with them - the first night I was on hold for an hour before giving up, the second night I gave up after 30 minutes. I tweeted Spark explaining, no apology was given and I was told to email them - I didn't want to email, I wanted to speak with someone. I next turned to the Live Chat on their website - Very efficient, spoke to someone very helpful and all was sorted. I am slightly worried going forwards that should I have any problems it seems the only way to communicate is through Live Chat. Extremely hesitant.
2375|Spark's team are always helpful with any queries or issues you may have. If you are a budget conscious consumer, they will give you lots of helpful advice on being energy efficient and getting onto the best tariff, etc. for your requirements. Frequent readings (monthly, etc.) ensure you're always on track for accurate bills. I have no hesitation in recommending them, and in fact often do.
2376|I wanted to change to Direct Debit plan from my Current Premium Plan. The representative SR at Spark energy was very quick and friendly to get it going for me in less than 10 minutes. Much appreciated.
2377| Spark EnergyDO NOT USE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.They are the most appalling  Energy company I have ever come across:1)You can speak to them, provide them your direct debit details (TWICE) and then they send you a bill for the wrong amount and  threaten legal action that you havent paid your bill a mere 10 days after due date.2)They send a bill dated the 30th of the month- it lands on the 8th of the following month and you have a due date of the 11th (3 days after you receive it)3)By the 13th of the month they are calling, harassing and threatening to send you to debt collectors- all of this although we have provided them direct debit details TWICE previously.4)They admit to having a third party company for overflow calls- and that is their excuse as to how they have lost your personal bank account details.5)They are EXPENSIVE and disgusting to deal with.
2378|Very good service! The person was knowledgeable, helpful, and very polite.
2379|Instantly responded to my online request and was able to help me with both my requests right away. My expectations were exceeded when he was able to reduce my monthly prepayments down to only GBP20/month!The level of service is excellent for company that is one of the cheapest in the market.The website could be a bit more user friendly. For example adding a registration button on the online account login page.The contact centre representative was CT.
2380|I spoke to SR regarding my balance being in the minus, and being a first time renter it had me a little worried and SR reassured me that I was actually in credit.
2381|i was very happy with the online chat help i have just had.
2382|I contacted spark today, on live chat and was put through to an assistant, was picked up and in no time my concerns and problems with my account were sorted. I was due a refund as I was overpaying each month, long story short, I had my DD reduced, a refund authorised, and a very understanding assistant that gave me great understanding of what's happening.Very polite, very patient, great customer serviceAlways had poor experiences previously, changed my opinion.Thank you
2383|Today´s chat has been a useful experience. I tried to do it yesterday evening but was not possible to chat with anybody. The person in chat -CT- was kind and efficent.
2384|Cheap initial direct debit then 10 months in more than doubles direct debit to cover over usage even when frequent meter readings provided!!!!  Unhelpful staff! 
2385|Sparkenergy was gave me a really good service. It was easy to manage everything online and the customer service was always helpfull and usefull. 
2386|I don't have phone access tonight so utilised the online chat to make changes to my meter reading and also set up a direct debit facility. I spoke to BT who was really helpful and moved through the process quickly. She advised what I need to do in future to make sure my bills are accurate and was generally v helpful. I would use this service again. 
2387|The chat service is excellent and my false meter reading issue was sorted very quickly and efficiently.
2388|I used  the live chat on their website for an issue I had with my metre readings. I got quoted a big Gas bill to mine and my partners horror! I went online to talk to a customer service advisor and she was so helpful! She looked into it straight away and noticed I had actually been entering them incorrectly!! She resolved the issue within 15-20 minutes for us and has sent us a new statement etc she was absolutely brilliant! Really friendly and understanding of my stupid mistake!! Couldn't be happier! Great customer service!
2389|Very happy with speed of response and result obtained regarding account overpayment. Less happy that it takes up to 28 days to issue a refund, which is not a customer-focussed policy! All in all, I was impressed with the speed of the operator and his review of my account.
2390|I spoke to a gentleman with the initials of SR today, he was helpful, understanding and patient even though I kept him waiting on my account number stupidly thinking bank number. ive had many dealings with british gas before and never found service like this! Well done Spark Energy!! :)
2391|I had an email through saying my direct debit was being increased and i wanted to know why.  It was explained that it was because the winter months are normally higher usage months, and so the bill was being adjusted.  CT was very good at explaining what was happening, and that we could potentially save some money if we were to be careful with our usage and submit monthly meter readings.  He made everything clear, and was very quick to answer the majority of my questions.
2392|Was helped by DB through a chat session that lasted just 10 minutes. I had a question about how much to pay in direct debit, she asked for the size of the apartment and recommended an amount. The best part was she also set up the direct debit for me right there so I didn't have to go back to the website to fill in any forms (no forms!!) it was fantastic. Quick and easy.
2393|It has been a great pleasure to have Spark Energy as our provider and I havealready recommended them to the people who are moving into my old flat.  The website is very easy to access and understand and the chat option is fantastic, I have thrice had to contact them because of concerns I had and the people I spoke to were just wonderful!
2394|Was dealt with without delay and now i am paying the correct DD amount
2395|I contacted SR on live chat this morning, after a sleepless night worrying about an email I had received notifying me of an increase in my utilities bill. Scott was fantastic, responding to my query with the utmost efficiency, whilst also being reassuring and friendly.Outstanding service, I am very very impressed!
2396|matters dealt with very efficiently.reference SR -Scott
2397|I was having trouble with changing my tariffs so I decided to use the live chat feature. CT was very helpful with changing my account directly on Spark's side. Everything was dealt with immediately and any other questions that I had were answered in detail. I'm very happy with this new feature as it's very helpful.
2398|Helped by B.T today and it was simple to live chat and she was very polite and helpful. 
2399|Good customer service, all my problems sorted in a friendly manner.
2400|Always had great experiences when I need to phone or use the live chat. Helpful, knowledgeable and friendly staff. A few minor admin issues with my account, but these have always been sorted out straight away when pointed out. 
2401|Spark chat representative BT was available promptly and dealt with my question efficiently and quickly and in a friendly manner. It felt like she was speaking over the phone rather than typing!
2402|Excellent service by the chat representative. Took less than 5 minutes to start a new electricity service for the new flat i've moved into - couldn't have been simpler. Great guy SR.
2403|Efficient and helpful chat session with SR, after having difficulty contacting Spark for several days. 
2404|I am very pleased with how much they have helped with telling me my account status and when they will be supplying us and other information 
2405|Great help from the customer service rep. Thanks! They chatted to me online, and they were very efficient and fast. Excellent service
2406|I could not enter my meter reads as one was less than the estimate. Help was sought from online chat and matter resolved in minutes, Thanks!
2407|Thank you for looking into my account & being so helpful
2408|After lots of emails and a phone call, this live chat finally gave me a good explanation for my bill. Thanks!
2409|Excellent service, rang in but there was a queue, so selected ring back, but as I was on line I used the online chat service. I received my call back within minutes while I was also on the online chat. Continued with the chat service with Scott, he was really efficient sorted out my request within minutes. Just a really good company to deal with nocks spots off the big energy companies for price and service.
2410|I got in touch with Spark energy via live chat and was helped by a brilliant young lady, no trouble was too much for her. She was very polite, patient, knowledgeable and friendly. Keep up the good work.
2411|very helpful and accommodating member of staff. Listened to my issues and resolved them quickly.Polite and pleasant.
2412|I'm a student from South Korea So at first i didn't understand the billing system in the UKBut You guys were very kind so i totally understand itThanks very much
2413|I really like the live chat option as saves me from wasting time waiting on hold on a call. SR was able to answer my request well and efficiently.
2414|I chanbed to Spark Energy on the advice of a comparison site. The reason I looked on the comparison site was because my supplier advised me they were putting up my monthly payments to GBP96.My change to Spark Energy went smoothly and my monthly payments were reduced to GBP71. As an old age pensioner on a fixed income that extra mone was useful. Now I reguarily put my meter readings in as advised so all my bills reflect real useage not estimates. For some reason I could not view my latest bill which was for August so contacted the live chat to find out why.  I was advised there was a technical issue and the bill would be calculated in a few minutes. When the answer came through it was that my average usage over the last nine months was GBP60 per month which prompted me to comment that my payment was higher and you had lots of my money.The reply was that the payment would be reduced to GBP60 from next month. You still have a load of my money ,nearly GBP300 , so I should be O.K. and so will your company. The contact I had was very helpfull and prompt in response to my query. My only comment would be that I would expected your company to have spotted that I was constantly in credit at one time over GBP300,but always in credit by a large figure with respect to my useage.And yes I know about the summer being lower than the winter. I thought that there had been a change in the law to make energy suppliers not build up high credits.I will remain a customer but will check at the end of the year to see that you are keeping up to your promise.Many thanksBrian
2415|I chatted with your agent DB on your online chat feature which is very useful when you are unable to call or have the time to wait in a queue for an agent. The length of time when I called in was over 15 minutes with no answer which I then hung up as I was chatting to the agent online. I do feel the length of time to get through on the phone is a concern and does need to be looked at.However the agent DB was very helpful and quick and looking at my issue and then resolving the matter. she also confirmed what the next action that would be taken.
2416|I didn't give 5 stars as I don't have a lot of contact with the company, although that can be a good thing, nothing to complain about !
2417|Chat function really useful and the guy (Scott was really helpful. My problem was solved in 3mins
2418|I had an online chat with a member of your team today about changing my Spark pay as you go meter and exchanging it for a credit meter.The member of staff was very polite and easy to talk to.  I asked a few 'awkward' questions which she didn't know the answer to but said that she would find out for me and email the answer.She was very easy to deal with and chatty with me.
2419|Went on live chat to find out details of what to do when we were due to move house in a few weeks. Operator was very helpful and gave me all the information I needed and additionally changed my direct debit down so we would have a balance close to GBP0 around the time of moving. Answered all my questions concisely and honestly. Why can't all operators be this easy to deal with!
2420|Very helpful, friendly and easily approachable customer service. 
2421|This review is purely on today's web chat which has been an entire success.  However, based on the service I have previously received from Spark I would NEVER recommend using the company.  It took 9 months to get a simple problem sorted out which was not of my making.  It resulted in my Brother's account becoming in arrears - not his fault- and then we were threatened by unpleasant messages when the arrears were not cleared immediately.  The error was originally caused by the Estate Agent reading the wrong meter.  His error should have been obvious instantly.  I requested a meter reader to visit - this NEVER happened.  I submitted endless emails and photographs. A semi-solution was reached.  A solution in your favour not ours.  I have not received an appropriate apology for your company's laziness and I am very glad you do not supply the energy for my Brother's new flat.
2422|He was very quick and helpful
2423|Wonderful today I contacted spark and a man help me to the point of excellence I can only say that this man deserves recognition for his customer service with out a doubt 10/10 many thanks again Scott and also Spark for having me as a customer x
2424|I wanted to switch my energy providers, had questions around switch and also wanted to know contract information. DS provided an amazing and to the point information on chat. Very happy.. Seamless.
2425|Chatted to 2 advisers via Live Chat, got to chat with someone within seconds, both very helpful and sorted what I needed. Needed to update my name and up my direct debit. Was done within seconds. Great advice. Very happy, thank you.
2426|Well done. Excellent job! The staff member was great. Problem fixed!
2427|I had a chat with SR about the discrepency in my previous meter reading when Spark started supplying to my property from 30th of September and on my account I saw a wrong reading @ my start date. So the operator raised an industry dispute form and assured the correct reading will be updated in 4 to 6 weeks he was really helpful in providing all the information I needed.
2428|Never had a problem, unlike most other energy firms. Tariffs fairly clear. I would use them again. I used their customer service a few times when setting up, always easy to get in touch with - live chat online, or they will arrange a call back rather than making you sit in a queue for 30 mins! That alone is worth using them for!
2429|SR - Speedy response and resolution to my problem. Would recommend to a friend Thanks
2430|easy set -up my account with SR.Will have to see later on how good the service is but for now I was happy I didn't have to call to set -up..
2431|Very helpful, efficient and timely. Resolved all my queries and outstanding issues, even if the answer wasn't quite what I expected.
2432|Tried to call and was on hold for more than 20 mins so decided to use online chat help. A lovely gentleman was absolutely brilliant and a pleasure to 'talk' to. How nice to be helped in such a friendly way in my own personal time of struggle. He was professional, efficient and caring. My issues were resolved quickly and I would definitely recommend online chat to anyone. Thanks CT, credit to spark energy
2433|I was initially concerned about the direct debit amount for my account and the operator  was extremely helpful and efficient. He acted with pace and was friendly. Definitely recommend.
2434|The on line service is excellent. Billing is simple and straightforward. When my account has gone into credit, the direct debit has been reviewed and I have been issued a refund. SO MUCH better than my previous supplier NPower who were a nightmare!The on line chat service works brilliantly as well. Thanks BT for fast and helpful response 
2435|Always find the staff pleasant polite & professional to deal with. Request a call back and they DO call you back promptly. Have had an excellent service, glad I chose Spark.
2436|I logged on rather than phoning because I thought it'd be easier - and it was. Done within five minutes, I handed over my final meter readings. I was also asked to include the person's initials who was on the other end of the chat - hopefully that's OK. They were SR. 
2437|Not sure why but it seems I always have to request my bill multiple times after submitting meter readings. I never receive a response if I Submit a request on the Web page, calling cost me money and takes forever, so I found the best contact method is via the on-line chat. Lady on there just made my bill up in a few seconds so no idea why this doesn't happen automatically. My bill for period ending 31 July appeared on my account on 18 Sep and after submitting meter readings on 26 Sep and contacting Spark three times I finally just got my bill on 10 Oct. My last bill (ending 31 Jul) was so late I though it was my current bill! The result is my account is very high in credit so I now need to request a refund. 
2438|website is simple well designed not fussy i could find info on what i needed, sign up and sort my account very easily. the chat function is fantastic any problems or questions i have the staff solve very quickly and are very friendly.
2439|Room very nice, I recommend
2440|Member of staff was very helpful and dealt with all enquiries well.
2441|I have managed to reduce my bill substantialy by switching to spark dealt with by SR
2442|Great phone service. Helpful, cheerful, effective. Like the online system 
2443|I spoke to Beth (BT) on Live Chat today and she was really helpful! I have moved out for the first time and was really confused about what was going on with regards to my gas and electric. Beth helped me understand what was going and in a quick and clear manner which has left me with a very good opinion of the company's customer service. I won't think twice or worry about having to contact my supplier in future now and wanted to write this review to ensure that Beth got the credit she deserved for this. Thanks Beth, Matt. 
2444|I had to do a few complicated things on the live chat, with BT at Spark Electric. She was efficient and quick to answer my questions and sort out the processes I needed. The whole experience was fast, friendly and effective. Thank you!
2445|Customer representative helped and changed my direct debit date, very polite and helpful. 
2446|Spoke to SR on the online chat - he was very helpful and sorted all my problems. Waiting time was null. Happy customer here - hopefully things won't change! 
2447|everything was fine it was actually a pleasure to talk to some one so understanding.  not like internet providers they are terrible.  full marks to you lot and to scot. 
2448|Called them as moved into new property and was switching away from them.English call centre and call back much appreciated.
2449|very good help saved waiting on phone operator did a good job and very clear on how to do thing . thank you
2450|the best help that you can have online. they are very friendly and helpfull. i would like to say thanks to all the team because they make this web site great and the company strong. they bill you accurately ;)
2451|Very helpful online chat with 'CT'. Had just moved house and wanted to set up energy tariff online. He was friendly and patient and efficient. Sorted me right out. Thanks. 
2452|DB was so much help and when I got cut off they transferred me back to her. Much more helpful than other energy companies.Will recommend.
2453|I tend to not get excited about utility companies, but compared to any other I have used, Spark Energy are fantastic. Not only do real people answer your emails quickly and efficiently, if on the rare occasion you do have to call and there is a wait, you just press one option and they ring you back as soon as you are at the front of the queue. Value for money is great compared to others, and the staff I have emailed or called are very very helpful indeed.
2454|Hi, Just had my problem sorted in record time by SR. Was very satisfied.
2455|I know I probably shouldn't mention her name but I've just been on a live chat session with an adviser who was most helpful. Probably the best and most efficient person I've ever dealt with in any of the utility companies I have dealt with. She fully explained my account, the balance, diercrt debit situation and made the required adjustments immediately. Very impressed !!! 
2456|Got sorted in a flash! Very informative and helpful
2457|Spoke to a customer service rep via live chat, and question was answered within minutes. Thank you, so much better than spending wasted time trying to get through on the phone and waiting and waiting until you're through to an operator. Operator was friendly. Would recommend to anyone.
2458|Nothing could be easier than using Spark to provide your energy supply with its simple, user-friendly paperwork and online service. The friendly and easy to use online chat customer service is especially recommended. I had an issue with an unusually high estimated bill that was solved within a matter of minutes. No pushy aftersales either. Just great service!
2459|Very helpful chap (CT), and sorted everything (readings and refund) out for me.
2460|highly recommend, lowest prices ever!
2461|It was a quick, and suffiecient help. Much appreiciated. 
2462|Thank to Collin for the helpQuick, what i need, offer Good suggestion..well don CT
2463|"I joined up with Spark via Uswitch and was really glad I did.  The Spark website is simple to use, especially for giving meter readings and the like, the information given very clear, and the amount of contact kept to a minimum with no spam regarding other services they're trying to peddle like others do! :)Plus, they were a hell of a lot cheaper than my previous suppliers, which is obviously the main reason for moving in the first place.I'd certainly recommend them to anybody that is considering jumping away from the ""big boys"".  In fact, move away from the big boys anyway just to distribute the power (if you pardon the pun) a bit more!Thanks, Spark. Keep up the good work!"
2464|It is so nice to be able to contact a utility supplier and actually feel like a person and not just a number. Friendly and helpful staff that actually answer your question no spin or transferring to other departments. If only all companies worked like this, life would be so much easier.
2465|the customer service rep has been excellent and very efficient.Couldn't ask for anything better  Initials of serve rep SRDefinitely recommend it to family and friend and better service than over phone 
2466|The live chat option is great, was helped by C.T he was helpful, fast and gave me the required information, even the number of my previous energy supplier. Prefer live chats to waiting on the phone for ages, good stuff! 
2467|Since being with Spark over 2 years , i have had the best possible prices on both Gas & Electricity for my much higher than average domestic consumption. I am not committed to long term contracts at all, and i have tested the prices regularly - i should know i am a full time energy broker!!On top of of this when i have needed to change DD  dates temporarily change or delay payments they have worked with me no problem and with excellent communication facilities especially the online chat system. Very good polite customer service and to be honest cant fault the whole customer impinging operations.My advice is - get on it!!NE / STOKE  
2468|first class service. my questions were answered quickly and to my satisfaction putting my mind at ease
2469|I talked to a representative initialed DB and she/he was super helpful and fast. Im totally happy with the customer service!
2470|Hi I wasnt happy with the fact that I was being charged 86GBP a month when I had a credit balance of over GBP325 on my account.  I was told I havent given a meter reading since June 2014, however I believe I given my readings G4 agent who came to my door a few times this year.  Well either case I had a large credit and so the agent (CT) was able to reduce monthly dd to GBP5 a month for two months and there after GBP70 a month.  I m happy with that.   
2471|Out of all the utility companies I have dealt with Spark are by far the best and easiest to get in contact with, love the live chat feature, I now use that as my first point of contact rather than picking up the phone and being on hold for endless minutes **cough cough EDF*** Most of my queries have been sorted in under 10mins!Brilliant customer services
2472|I am worried about my bills and need to pay monthly which is costly.From their direct debit scheme i saved by 20%.I will surely recomment to my friends and family.
2473|Spent 20 minutes trying to get through on the phone to an operator so gave up and tried the live chat function. Got straight through to an operator (DB), who was very helpful and managed to sort my issue out straight away.
2474|"Just one word ""Excellent""Fantastic service  By customer service. Very polite staff, 100% I will recommend."
2475|My account online was not up to date, i spoke to 'SR' via the online chat and he solved my problem in minutes. He was very helpful and updated my account very promptly. Couldn't have given a better service myself if i tried! Very pleased :) Thank you!!
2476|Had a support chat with DB, she was very attentive to what I needed to do (get a refund for paying too much in the last year). Everything was sorted within 15 minutes. Good stuff!
2477|"Great service using on-line chat with SR. I hate calling on the phone as the agents are usually under pressure to get the initial problem solved and then move on. SR was able to investigate my problem fully (as on ""chat"" I'm sure there are several ""balls in the air"" at any one time so more time can be allocated) and get the issue raised with the right department. It is really nice when someone remembers you from the last call and promises to get it sorted.... Here's hoping."
2478|Efficient and fast, very much customer oriented. I am extremely happy about the way my questions have been answered. IU want to remark the efficient and proffessional way [name removed]has dealt with this.
2479|Hi,I had a chat with one of your representatives and was very satisfied with the way my query was resolved. I am thankful to Spark for their service.
2480|"I moved to Spark after I moved into a new rented place and the agency gave them me number. I wasn't too fussed initially as I was on a terrible plan from another company left over the previous owners so I did some research and actually it was one of the cheapest around (of course for my circumstances that is - Electricity and Gas by direct debit). Customer service has been hit and miss. I have had to have some very frank conversations with some reps who were obviously fed set policies and set information from computers. However, today I had an excellent online conversation with one rep (""BT"") who not only was polite and instantly said the magical words ""I can help with that"", but even went the step further with helping with something I didn't even ask for. Brilliant. So a little bit of pot luck it seems - but worth it."
2481|Enquiry answered by SR. Problem found and solved. Many thanks
2482|I spoke to a member of the customer service team named SR. I would say that the service was great and my query was dealt with nicely.Much apreciated.
2483|Am very happy with spark energy although the guy who came to read the meter only read the electric not the gas but apart from that very happy here 
2484|DB gave me a good service and was able to answer my questions efficiently.I am not with Spark by choice and am not happy that I have a prepayment meter so would not recommend this company particularly. I am not satisfied that I would be charged so much money to have the prepayment meters removed as a new customer either so am looking for a get out! This would be simple for Spark to change.
2485|I like the online accounts. I love the live hat that is so helpful and necessary especially when people have busy lives and just need things to be sorted quickly. the service provided is good, never had any problems. give my meter readings every month and it all works well, seems to be good value for money. never heard of spark before but I would recommend to a friend, for my gas anyway. 
2486|British gas robbed me blind and am still paying one year on for my huge bills.With spark energy I am over 800 pounds in credit after one year.Unbelievable that british gas get away with this pure robbery.I am hugely relieved that my bills have improved immensely as before a lot of my income was going on gas and electric.Thrilled to bits today.
2487|Took ages to set up, but looks ok so far
2488|Came to online chat to submit my Electricity meter reading as the main site wouldn't let me I was connected to staff member SR and he was a great help :)  He submitted my meter reading and amended my bill also lowering my set DD so I can re-set up paying by DD, I Constantly recommend Sparks energy to my friends and family and I will carry on doing so :)   
2489|the operator (CT) was really swift and clear. 
2490|DB very quick to respond and resolved issue quickly.  Previous operators have also been great
2491|Absolutely great provider. easy and helpful chat line. truly recommend to others.looks like one a very few that taking care for the customers. just did everything online including the meter readings and payments. all of it in just a few minutes. 
2492|DB very helpful in setting up my new account
2493|The online chatting system is amazing. For someone who is anxious about speaking on the phone, this is the best thing ever. The team seems great and all the people I have chatted with have always done their best to help me out. Today a lady named Kristy was the one helping me, and I am forever grateful. Thank you very much.
2494|"I just used online chat with your rep ""DB"" to update the direct debit. It was amazingly efficient and easy. Thanks very much DB!"
2495|I came online to enter a meter reading.  This is very simple, clear and easy to use.  Afterwards I decided to check my bill.  I had a query that I wanted clarification with, so I used the 'live chat' feature to speak to an operator (CT).  He was very helpful and efficient, explaining my bill to me, giving me my options and then making the necessary adjustments for me.  I was delighted to find that my average monthly usage is less than I have been paying and feel that Spark energy give very fair and affordable tariffs.  On the whole, I am very happy with the service and shall continue to use Spark as long as they are as efficient and good value as they have been to date!
2496|Got everything done quickly and easily, saved me a lot of hassle. Thanks.
2497|I would only suggest to be able to give the client and estimate amount to pay based on the readings provided.
2498|absolute happy, will chat again if there are any problems. Much better then calling
2499|I received all what I need in a quick way, my bill and the meter reading,  so I am satisfy 
2500|Great - cheap rates and excellent customer service, very impressive.
2501|I was absolutely happy for the service which the adviser provided.
2502|I have contacted Spark twice today by using the online chat facility. Both times the customer service operatives were very helpful and knowledgeable, not sure who I spoke to first however the second adviser was DB, the chat was easy to use and overall I was extremely satisfied with the service received.
2503|Answered my questions extremely effectively. Great Job by DB!
2504|Super quick to get hold of someone via online chat, virtually instant. Staff member was super helpful and quick to deal with my problem. Nothing to dislike!Was previously with one of the big 6 energy suppliers, who to be honest were a nightmare to get hold of and completely useless!
2505|I just had to enter my meter reading that I couldn't from the web because my meter has the daily/nightly dual reading. The operator SR fixed that for me quickly.
2506|Great and very efficient help from SR today.  Sorted my query very quickly and courteously
2507|Put simply they are cheaper than the rest with easy to understand tariffs, a simple website and you can actually speak to a human being! The switchover was pretty painless and hassle-free. 
2508|A couple of simple requests that were easy to log and complete from my mobile via chat. Done and dusted!
2509|Great prices when I signed up 18 months ago and there's no contract so I'll change supplier when I find a cheaper offerCustomer service is great, especially the on line chat
2510|SR provided a friendly and helpful service and resolved my problem.  The live chat feature makes it easy to contact the company whilst getting on with other things.
2511|I spoke to a member of staff on the click to chat. As a student living in a student house, I did not know how to pay my gas & electric bills and got myself into a bit of a panic. Luckily, I happened to get a brilliant adviser , she provided excellent customer services out me at ease over some issues I was having with the idea of direct debit, and just went above and beyond her duty. She put me very much at ease and I will happily use this service again!
2512|low rate prices, and good customer service
2513|Our direct debit payments were way higher than the amount of energy we were using.  It felt like the age old problem that we have seen with other companies.  Got ready for a struggle and to have to fight for a refund.  But no, the representative on the live chat was direct, matter of fact and immediately reduced our monthly payment and arranged a refund of the credit.  Of course the direct debits should have been set at a more realistic amount to begin with.  We should have had a say in the level to be set when we switched to this provider.
2514|Fast and profesional assist thats what I expect.
2515|Quick and friendly response.  Very helpful. thanks
2516|The staff members are very helpful and helps me with the problem I have. 
2517|Had an on-line chat with an adviser about a large credit balance that had arisen because of the Arctic winter of 2012/13 and because the payments had been way too low for a couple of years. He got straight back and reduced the monthly Direct Debit and has arranged for a refund of most of the credit amount. He was both friendly and professional, and promptly came back with the information about the refund and reduced payment. The on-line chat system was very easy to use, there were no technical issues and, most importantly, it didn't cost me anything!
2518|I used your live chat. I was assisted by CTHe was very helpfulAnswered all the questionsSet up my direct debitGave me advice on your serviceAssessed my paymentsAllowed me to make choicesExcellent serviceWill use againThank you 
2519|good service and live chat is really quick and useful. I do recommend to manage the account through the website
2520|Got through to an operator (CT) on live chat (didnt want to use the 0345 number to call on my mobile). Was able to sort out meter readings and also to work out balance and reduce monthly payments, all quickly and with no problems. Great customer service, would recommend to everyone.
2521|Spark Energy's electricity and gas prices are quite low.Their staff arte always polite and helpful.
2522|I had just submitted my up-to-date meter reading and went to live chat to find out when my bill would be available on line. The operator immediately said she could do it straight away if I gave her a couple of minutes.  This she did and the bill was immediately available for me, which was very helpful. Excellent service - I couldnt have asked for more!
2523|My query was answered promptly and in full.
2524|All was great, conversation - perfect, with all answers that I need. It's really good to have this chat option, as on phone I need wait really long time, to get a simply answer, to make sure everything is ok.I'm happy, all sorted.Thanks!
2525|no messing around, got all the info I needed. Thank You.
2526|SR has been very kind helping me to finish the setup of my account.he helped me to add the gas and electricity meter serial number and to add another person to my account
2527|In general a pretty expensive company and they weren't very clear with their information. We soon chose to swap suppliers and this wasn't the easiest thing either. However everyone I spoke to on the phone was pleasant and the callback system worked well also. Spoke to CT on the online chat and he was extremely helpful and friendly, makes it much easier when they are talking (or typing) plain english to you and not anything from a script.
2528|quick response, great service and support
2529|Very nice support and fast service 
2530|SR dealt with my claim very quickly and efficiently and should be rewarded with a very large bonus.
2531|SR made the process of setting up an account very easy and straight forward. Can't really say anything about the product and the rates yet as I'm a new customer but their chat function works well.You could also tell the operator was not chatting with 10 different customers at the same time and used ctrl+c / ctrl+v with standardized greetings. Instead he was very personal and nice.
2532|Found the process very quick and painless.
2533|I have used a number of Energy companies in the past, but none have come close to the service provided by Spark Energy and their team. Today Aaron Reid helped me with a question I had and he resolved it completely in a manner that was very friendly and helpful. This is consistent with my earlier dealings with Spark Energy. It would be great if other companies followed the same model, but I am sure that if Spark keep this up they will become a major player in this industry.
2534|excellent service, and a friendly service from the adviser, would recommend to a friend.
2535|I had an issue with direct debit payments going out for months after spark stopped supplying my property, and the refund was calculated in a few minutes, and the problem was solved. Much less of a headache than I thought it'd be.Staff initial: CT
2536|Very helpful, quick support although only available within office hours. It appears I have overpaid on my account  however I can't access the excess payments for them to be paid back to me for six weeks which I feel is wrong. No one advised me I was overpaying and I had received no contact regarding this from Spark. The assistant I spoke to was very polite and helpful though and di apologise for the delay. His initials were SR
2537|Operator answered all my queries via instant chat. No hanging around, was simple and easy.
2538|Used live webchat for a billing query - service was excellent. No waiting time to speak to someone, and my query was sorted out easily and efficiently. So much better than 40 mins on hold waiting for EDF on the phone. The guy I spoke to (SR) was very professional and had good communication skills (erm, i.e. he had a good grasp of the English language, unlike some webchat staff who have to use pre-fabricated phrases).
2539|Helped fix swap over tenants 
2540|I moved recently from London to Southampton. I found your customer service very clear on given instructions and very helpful. I particularly like the 'call back initiative' as I don't have time to stay in the line. I love the live chat, the staff was fantastic and helped me on my enquiries. Please promote this member of staff.
2541|Just finished talking to one of the Live Chat agents, his name was Scott, he was great help and accomplished what I asked of him, in super speedy time! Great experience.
2542|advisors have always been very helpful and friendly, however, I recieve an email asking for meter readings as they are preparing a bill, so I give them the meter readings it then takes a further 3 months for them to produce my bill! I also then have no notification that the bill is ready to be viewed online so I am left constantly having to check online to see if my bill is avaliable yet!
2543|SR was good and friendly, but the company takes too long to refund your money if you overpay. The company is at fault here and not the staff member.
2544|Customer service on live chat is very good. >SR< is very helpful and was able to assist me with my inquiry.
2545|The rates of this provider are quite good compared to the market and they'll give a good reliable service. the cost saving is obviously made in their procedures and administration. i get infrequent bills and quite a high direct debit initially.the online chat support is helpful, informative and very quick and simple, without sitting on hold for ages like many organisations. they are very quick and skilled at sorting out the above.my advice is definitely use this company, the lower costs is worth having, but be prepared to monitor your account, submit meter readings and make sure that you get a bill generated each month, keep an eye on the direct debit amount and get them to correct things, with the brilliant customer service this only takes a few minutes and is worth the extra savings.
2546|The one problem with this company is not letting people know when there is a large credit to your account. Only if you check are you aware of your money sitting in Sparks account. 
2547|I had a live chat with a lovely lady. Very efficient and quick she foxed my problem in a blink of an eye.I am very pleased with this service
2548|I talked to SR today about my problems with Spark and British Gas. He was wonderful and answered all my questions immediately. 
2549|"Very helpful online ""chat"" tool. Helpful guy called Scott sorted everything else."
2550|Tariff is much cheaper than giant energy companies and even 5* service as well . Saving lot of money after switching to spark energy
2551|Chatted with SR about my bill and was completely satisfied. Polite, quick and co-operative.
2552|I can honestly say it was probably the best gas and electric firm i have used no long waiting over the phone all done online and i would recommend to a friend thanks  Jay
2553|very nice and patient service for me. and easy to solved out the problems and questions quickly than other suppliers. This online Chat is very useful, which save a lot of time to me. I definitely recommend my friends to choose your company to be the first option.!
2554|I felt compelled to write advising you of the quite exceptional telephone service I had with your operative who was most understanding and resolved my query with good humour and the ability to deal with me quickly and with the gift of making me feel that my custom was appreciated by Spark. I will certainly advise all me friends of this outstanding customer care. Thank you very much. Regards Christopher Evans
2555|whenever I have a problem (which is not often) I have used the chat facility and it is brilliant! My problem is always solved in seconds and the chat person  who was (ST) today, is always lovely
2556|Thank you >SR< for dealing with my problem of not being able to submit meter reading online. The issue was resolved within 5 mins by chat service and I'm very happy. I should have used this service earlier, as having email conversation took a lot of time and it was quite stressful.
2557|The people who sorted out my refund were very professional and efficient. However the email I received mentioned an attachment which was not attached.
2558|Sorted my issue out with minimum of fuss
2559|A shame I cannot leave the chat member's name.  Anyway, the person that helped me on chat was straightforward, pleasant, efficient and did not keep me waiting for long.  He took my meter readings and changed my registered email address for me.  I liked the convenience of the chat facility when I did not have my phone to hand and I liked the fact that we had time to exchange pleasantries, as well as getting straight to the matters in hand. There was nothing I did not like and I was very impressed with the way my enquiry was handled (I work in Customer Relations, and find that I don't get chance to give out complements very often, so it was great to have this opportunity to deal with your staff member and get such a positive response).
2560|SR, the operator, was extremely patient and helpful with my questions; he was also notable very prompt in his replies. Was a pleasure.
2561|Have been a customers of Spark for about 18 months, I did build up a bit of credit with them, but just asked for it to be returned and reduced the monthly direct debit going forward. I find their tariffs reasonable, and as I'm happy to do my billing and customer discussions online (they have an online chat facility so I don't have to sit on hold on the phone).SR was the guy I had an online chat with today, very professional and prompt response.
2562|Excellent service from SR, including revision of my Direct debit, that I did not ask for.
2563|Issue with account, and meter readings took and added very quickly. Great customer service, would certainly recommend.
2564|Beth you're simply brilliant! Things go wrong in any business, but the way care staff deal with the issue makes all the difference. Beth was friendly and helpful from the start.
2565|It is really nice to see that a real person is actually dealing with your requests. It is the second time I use live chat, and both of the operators are just amazing! Really friendly, and they know what they are doing. In both cases, they solved my problems in a very friendly way and very quickly!  P.S. it`s really nice when you are stressed by a electricity bill problem to see some cute smiley faces in the conversation!! ( :) )
2566|both ross shiel by e mail and the person on live chat were excellent
2567|very good customer service. They answer me what I asked.
2568|I had a small issue and chatting I was able to sort it out quickly and easily. The operator was friendly and helped with exactly what I needed. Great service.
2569|Hi,   an overpayment issue was sorted quickly with a refund and lowering of direct debit. (sr) However some concerns that the overpayment got above GBP500 initially.   It would also be good for the operator to just type the odd word while you are waiting, because it seems like ages when you're just sat waiting (though it isn't really)
2570|got all the info i wanted from today, very helpful !! quick and to the point help. 
2571|Operator was friendly and efficient. SR helped with my problem by providing a rather easy solution which left everybody happy. I would use Live Chat every day of the week if I could.
2572|Customer help service is very very quick and helpful! Not that familiar with other energy suppliers to compare actual fees or how they run but so far no problems! No complaints though, and a lot of praise for the online customer service team. Helped me several times now.
2573|I had an online chat with your tema member regarding my customer reference number. I have just moved into the property and needed this number to register online. I received all the help I needed and the team member set up an account for me as well which was fantastic. 
2574|The chat service is very useful, as it is a great way to assist the customers who need help.Today I had a chat with (CT), which was excellent in solving my issues.I would definitely choose Spark in the future.
2575|Very pleased with quick chat. He sorted out my query within seconds. Seems a big improvement Spark, well done.
2576|"I was very pleasantly surprised by the customer service agent's reply to many of my ""newbie"" questions. She was very patient and went out of the way to give me suggestions and ideas on saving money. It is unfortunate I am not allowed to include her name, but I would gladly do so, if contacted directly!I am glad I could get to speak to a ""human"" without any trouble, and that too someone who seemed very knowledgeable. I hope the service from Spark is the same! Expectations have been raised quite high :)"
2577|The assistant was superb.  I'd been waiting for 10 minutes on the phone and thought that I'd try Live Chat.  I was on and engaged with your assistant within 10 seconds.  She sorted the problem out extremely efficiently.  Thank you and I'm delighted to be switching to Spark.  
2578|very satisfied with phone conversation polite and caring and resolved my on going issue most grateful also I`m a man of few words :-) 
2579|Staff is very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. 
2580|I think, the live chat it is brilliant help for any custumers who need quik and easy answers. Anything can be sorted and you can have useful advices in a short period of time.
2581|I had an issue with sending my meter readings online so used Live Chat.  The advisor was excellent and answered my questions instantly.  Many Thanks
2582|Since my first changing to SPARK Energy I have received the utmost respect as a customer and when I complained about an issue instead of being fobbed off I was listened to and even given a remuneration for the mistake made!I found this refreshing in an Energy Provider. The things I didn't like were the original website and the fact I could not place a  reading online and it took quite long to get online proper. I would have no hesitation in recommending this supplier of energy to all as you get the best of everything and a very competitive and fair dual fuel tariff!
2583|Been with Spark for 2 years, the bills/statements are usually wrong. I check my account monthly and make monthly meter readings, but they still can't seem to get it right. A simple monthly statement/bill would be the best. Makes you wonder that they are not sure of what they are doing. Their customer service is always brilliant - if you talk to someone or use the chatline - they always manage to get my account back where it should be. It takes up time - I would prefer to have a company that can provide accurate information on my account webpage without having to resort to interaction( pleasant though everyone is). Would I recommend - well probably not - though all the energy companies seem to have their problems. I've just changed onto a new tariff with Spark. If they manage to get this one right I'll stay. Otherwise I can see myself looking at other options.
2584|Customer service excellent.
2585|operator SR was very helpful and assisted me when I needed clarity on my bills
2586|Had an email chat with CT, first time I've done this with Spark, and it went really, well, CT was friendly and had good banter with him, didn't have to wait to chat to him either, good service, also happy cos I was GBP141 in credit, good all round.
2587|It was really good. Scott >SR< was really helpful and patient. Resolved all my issues. Did all while I am sat at work. i would use this everytime now rather than phone.
2588|I was contacting Spark Energy help-line chat and was served by SR. Session last no more than 5 minutes and I got information I needed. Happy.
2589|Very friendly and helpful. I got the problem I had sorted very quickly and the staff at Spark were great!
2590|I spoke to Scott via Instant messaging. He was very helpful and answered all my questions. I am not good at sorting bills out but it is a lot easier than I thought. Scott was there to answer any questions I had.
2591|I have used the online chat feature with Spark a couple of times now and I wish it were available on the other service websites I use. I get answers to my queries in no time at all and I've been 100% satisfied with the customer service I've received. No bad music to listen to, no expensive telephone calls, no waiting. an all round excellent feature that makes my life a lot easier. Thank you Spark. 
2592|SR was very friendly and solved my question efficiently and quick. He was kind at every moment and very professional. Definitely if I have to chat with somebody else I hope to be him. 
2593|I queried my new direct debit amount as I wasn't sure if this was up to date.  Ended up saving more money and obtaining more credit.  The contact I spoke to was very helpful.I have to update readings each month which I'm worried about forgetting - a reminder from Sparky would be fantastic - but I hope my payments won't increase massively due to going into winter - so I have to ensure we keep an eye on the readings...  Very pleased with the service so far.
2594|very fast and helpful, the operator sorted out my request without any problems
2595|Brilliant having the live chat.The only part I would recommend is to have our account no. Incorporated into the top of the page.
2596|Every time I needed to contact the customer service team they were helpful, polite and accurate. I do appreciate when the staff doesn't make me lose my time, and they go straight to the matter in question.
2597|We had a credit with Spark and had recently moved house.  A quick 5 minute chat session got our money back to the bank account without any issue. 
2598|"First of all, if this review is about the webchat guy, and not Spark itself, then fine I messed up by giving this such a poor review. He was genuinely helpful, although even he had trouble explaining Sparks convoluted method of billing on our account, that was showing both balances underpaid and overpaid with minus signs. He assured me my account was currently overpaid, several times, and was pretty patient, as my trust for anything Spark says is gone. If this is a review about Spark, then 1 star is right. the 1 star they get is that my home actually has Gas and Electricity flowing to it right now. But the company is pure garbage. They lost over a years worth of meter readings due to a system error. They sometimes admit to this, and then sometimes don't it depends on who you talk to. But we were left with a GBP1663 bill because their estimation system had taken over, deciding some months we had used ""GBP12.83"" worth of Gas and Electricity in December of all months. After trying desperately to correct this we were eventually given a small discount to the overall amount by one of the guys that decided it was sparks fault. The discount was only awarded if we paid off a large chunk of it there and then (about half), which we did, putting us in crippling debt. But then they just stopped taking payments altogether. I had agreed a monthly Direct debit of GBP139 - way over the odds I was assured, which over time would correct the horrendous bill we had dumped on us. But they just wouldn't take payments. Every month, I called up several times to confirm that the Direct Debit was in place, and every month I was assured that the issue had been spotted, and resolved. But it wasn't. So before long, our bill was right back up to where it had been before the large chunk payment was made. It was like that money had just been completely wasted. So here I am, months later, after checking in with the Webchat guy, ensuring all our readings are still there, and all our bills are coming out. For him to confirm that we are GBP56 overpaid (a good thing!) as we can now finally close our account with Spark for good, and get a little money back from them. However, like I say, it looks like on the account we are GBP56 underpaid, and he can't explain why. I have recorded the Webchat conversation as I am certain upon closing the account, I will be asked to pay the GBP56 balance. Not even Sparks employees can understand their bill history format, which also screwed us over several times whilst sorting out the ordeal and being told conflicting things (at one point we were told spark owed us GBP933! Only to then be told that was an amount ADDED to our bill, only then to be told that was the total amount of the bill at the time) Final point of note - A friend of mine made arrangements to move into a property and called Spark to confirm she would be taking over the propertys account. Only for the deal to fall through last minute, so she called Spark to explain she was not moving in after all. She didn't even use any electricity (she never moved in) but 6 months later Spark are still claiming she needs to settle the previous tenants bill of GBP700 odd. Kind of reassuring to know it's not just me. I've also complained about Spark a lot on social media, and anybody who comments on it tells me they have also had horrendous difficulty with this company. Please, go somewhere else. "
2599|Nice system avoids waiting for phones to be answered and enables thinking time to get the main point across also no phone charges only downside is having to wait up to 28 days for refund if money was owed by me it would be collected immediately
2600|The adviser was very helpful and friendly. I would defiantly use this service again! 
2601|Was dealt with very efficiently and politely thank you
2602|The staff was helpful and explained everything, he gave good advice on how to deal with issue  
2603|Having had a very poor experience with Spark Energy when I moved into my property (I was presented with a bill for GBP800 after 1 month, having not been informed that they were my supplier in the first place), I must say I was expecting very little when I tried to close the account today via the chat facility on the web site. However, Scott, who I chatted with, couldn't have been more helpful and he sorted out my issues. I submitted a reading to me and he immediately was able to close the account. So, while I wouldn't recommend Spark as a supplier, my view of them has improved as a result of today's experience.
2604|It is very helpful to have someone responding in a professional and succinct manner. I was able to provide readings and arrive at a positive end to my question about being in credit. I still find the statements rather confusing compared to my previous supplier, but this should be solved if I remember to provide regular monthly readings.  Perhaps a monthly email reminder should be sent out to customers as a matter of course. Those who don't respond would have no reason to complain
2605|Fast and easy via webchat. Scott was very helpful and efficient.  Everything was explained swiftly and concisely.
2606|The member of staff I talked to was very kind and helpful. I just moved in so I had a lot of questions and he was very patient with me and extremely helpful.
2607|Very helpful, and nothing was too much trouble. Service was quick too. Did not wait at all.
2608|Having received my bill, I noticed that I was a quarter behind. Visiting the site I opened their chat window and I was responded to within seconds. After just stating the issue, the agent checked my account and agreed with me and generated the missing bill. My query was resolved within 5 minutes.I would definitely recommend SPARK Energy to anyone thinking about switching or who has had enough of the their big 6.  
2609|I joined Spark Energy in August 2013 so have been with them for just over a year now.  I was skeptical at first because they were not very well known, but I have to say that I have received excellent and prompt service whenever I have made contact.  I have had no reason to complain about anything, so all in all I would give them 10/10, which is more than I can say for the so called Big Six.
2610|The staff member was very quick to solve my problems and to recalculate the bill. He could promptly understand my requests and give me the correct answers. In the meantime, he was very kind, polite and helpful. I strongly recommand Spark energy, in particular the customer service chat.
2611|The person on the live chat was pleasant more than helpful and resolved the query with no problems a pleasure to deal with.I would recommend spark energy to family and friends.
2612|As a new customer, i hit a few teething issues, but the customer service was excellent as i could use live chat on their website to speak to somebody quickly and to get the job done.
2613|very friendly and helpful and got problem sorted quickly thanks
2614|The call back service and the way you could instant message them was really handy, since it meant you didn't have to spend ages waiting on the phone. A breath of fresh air from the big six who seem to have stopped trying.
2615|I have been with spark for a few years now. yes they have made a few errors but are very quick to put them right. The way you communicate with this company is very forward thinking and suits me down to the ground.Normally the operative you email or chat online too or speak to on the phone deals with whatever needs dealing with right away. This company is very forward thinking and I enjoy integrating with them 
2616|Today I communicated with an adviser on the live chat help service and found the experience very helpful...he was able to answer all my questions and queries clearly and I am entirely satisfied with the result. There was nothing about the service that I didn't like. I think that live chat is an excellent service. well done. ( I wish BT could learn a thing or two from you!!!)
2617|Really a pleasure to actually be in contact with a real person without the cost of a telephone call--He was such a help.  There was not a delay in waiting for the contact either.  Made my Day to speak? to such a happy and pleasant employee
2618|I have just finished a 6 month rental of a 2 bed bungalow and had to go with spark energy due to estate agent requirement I can now reveal there true costs they charged me 19.2 pence per kw hr .I have just moved and my new supplier First Utility are charging me 11.9 pence per kw hr what a big difference . I read my meter monthly and my bill for August 2014 was GBP68 electric for a 2 bed bungalow in the summer its a rip off don't go with them
2619|Very nice to talk to, helpful and concise.
2620|Really good online customer service. 
2621|I was moving out of the property and spending time outside the UK so had to close my account over live chat. I could not imagine that it would be so easy to do that online. Staff members were very helpful, polite and friendly too. The service is efficient and user friendly. Thanks for making this day easier! 
2622|I spoke to an advisor and he helped sort my question so much quicker than on the phone, what an efficient service!! Owen Roberts 13 Egerton Road Wilmslow Cheshire, SK9 4DG. This service cuts waiting time and allows the operater to deal with your request vertually as you are requesting it, it's as if they can see what you are typing as you type it!!! (I think they can!!) This system allows you work quickly with people who also work quickly and are computor literate. This is not to knock your phone service as that is very good too.
2623|I spoke with an advisor today and he was a pleasure to speak with. Very helpful, great service :) Happy Customer 
2624|excellent customer services, online chat is brilliant and quick no waiting, and nice friendly helpful staff
2625|I used online chat today to ask a question about when is a good time to submit meter readings which resulted in the chap clearing some error that had meant previous meter readings were not registered. Had a refund a reduction in the DD amount. If it were the other way around then I might not be pleased of course. Scott was friendly and good to talk to.
2626|I spoke with Scott.Was a very friendly and clarifying conversation. He was very helpful and answered all my questions
2627|people was helpfull. It was quite easy.thank you.I will recomend it my family and friends.
2628|Service was efficient and fast. Staff member was clear and concise and sorted my issue out whilst also letting me know what the problem was caused by. He then recommended that I set up a direct debit and took me through the process. Perfect service inside and out!
2629|Switching to your service was  very easy and stress free and today Iused  your chat service  for the 1st time and it was so easy and the advisor was so helpful
2630|Was able to sort a meter reading out immediately with operator on chat after I was not allowed to update estimates that were too high online.Quick and easy and was able to tell me new balance immediately.One negative point is that if you receive an estimated bill that is too high, you are not allowed to update with actual readings if they are lower than the estimate?  Bug?Anyway, quickly and easily resolved on chat.
2631|A friendly an courteous response. Quick to look into the issues 
2632|no bill had been sent to me through the e mail system so did live chat sorted straight away!!! fantastic
2633|I was served by an advisor. Very helpful and polite. I'm grateful for the service and will definitely recommend to a friend.
2634|The advisor was very helpful on live chat - great customer service 
2635|Quick and easier than calling and waiting on hold.  I was not initally happy as I had no choice but to use spark as a supplier by my landlord, but the service has been fine.
2636|I chatted with Scott today regarding a moving query. He acted quickly and professionally and was very friendly. I would use the service again.
2637|Scott was very helpful and polite. He made the whole problem become clear with a final sorted result.
2638|I have been with Spark Energy for over a year. They have an excellent customer service, with live chat, quick phone response and great email communication. However, I am not really satisfied with their prices as there are companies that offer better deals. Even so, I was offered GBP50 for deciding to remain with them so I have faith that they are going to develop and grow and become and excellent gas and energy supply company. They are so young and small, but yet they can compete with the Bigs.
2639|Having no landline and having ran out of mobile airtime credit I needed to deal with my query on my Spark account a different way. I thought this would be a problem however Spark's live chat service catered for my needs and the representative, Scott, dealt with my query quickly and efficiently. It's refreshing to use an online service that removes any need to spend money and time on phonecalls to customer service call centres.
2640|The customer service was excellent and my query was dealt with very quickly. top service.
2641|I am brand new to sparks so far everything went smoothly and effortless.Setting up new account, efficient help from representatives and even chat representative was extremely efficient
2642|Scott, the gentleman in the chat was very kind and súper helpful, the service was outstanding. I am very glad with the possibility of being able to have a chat and not be ages at the telephone. Everything was solved in a minute, and the tech part of the system worked very smoothly as well. 
2643|The agent was very helpful and answered all my outstanding queries. thx
2644|Recently bought 2nd property in Edinburgh.  Energy supplied by Spark but for own ease of use had to submit final meter reading and request transfer.  On-line chat took about 5 minutes in all to complete and Spark representative very helpful and polite.  Great service, albeit brief.  Thank you for your help.
2645|I like the way Spark Energy communicated me throughout my subscription. I had no problem at all on the direct debit. I believe Spark Energy gives a very good deal in terms of energy prices. I can certainly suggest it to family and friends. 
2646|So I have just moved into a new property and our landlord requested we used Spark for our gas and electric. I had never heard of them before and was quite sceptical, I was so used to using Eon I never thought about using anyone else! All I can say about Spark is I wish I would have joined them sooner, amazing customer service, I was able to speak to them over the phone and via online chat which was really convenient! The response for all of my queries and request were immediate and I wasn't waiting ages in a queue on the phone like I did when I was with Eon. I spoke to a man named Scott who was just so lovely and couldn't have done more to help! I am saving so much money on my monthly bills with Spark, and I really recommend that you check them out! They sent me a welcome pack and made the whole process really easy. They helped me set up a direct debit and advised me on the best tariff and best of all I didn't feel like they were trying to get more money out of me (which I always felt with Eon- I always had really bad experiences with them especially over the phone).I've never written a review about anything before but that's probably because I've never seen so pleased with the service before. So- thank you Spark! And don't just take my word for it, speak to them yourselves, guaranteed you will want to join them too!
2647|The agent I spoke to today was very helpful in setting up a direct debit and submitting meter readings for me
2648|Problem resolved quickly and courteously.Fixed the immediate problem and took action (I hope) so it would not happen again.Your online chat is a good service
2649|Always quick to help with friendly knowledgeable staff.
2650|Was able to get my questions answered right away
2651|very efficient service 
2652|I like the chat system because the person tends to answer pretty fast and you can solve small issues without having to wait more than 10 minutes on the phone. the experience I had so far has been good, people friendly and solved problems. definitely, this is the way i will keep contacting Spark Energy in the future
2653|I wanted help with canceling my account since I am moving houses. The person I spoke to was very helpful and kind. One of the best customer service chat engines I have used. Thanks a lot Sparky! 
2654|Just used the live chat service tans it was great. All questions answered and very helpful tool. I have limited phone signal where I work so it was ideal to talk online.
2655|am so glad  am fully saisfied
2656|Very proactive and got my questions answered in no time at all.  The staff was active and has a positive attitude.
2657|The interactive messanger is very simple and easy to use, got to the point straight away with no painful conversations overall very good
2658|Was not previously aware of the option to speak online but my experience has been that I would do it again over the phone route. Knowledgable and quick, my query was resolved without pain and without the use of multiple operators which is the norm with other providers
2659|Setting up the account was very easy and the online chat service was fast and helpful. If the service stays like this during the whole tenancy, I definitely recommend.
2660|Even typing, which is not very personal, I felt supported by you. My queries were resolved and it was in less than 3 minutes. And free!Perfect.
2661|I have trouble reviewing my account on line I would like to be able to review usage, how much that usage costs, how much I've credited the account with by my direct debit and an over all balance but I don't seem to be able to find a way to do it.However the online chat response is quick and the operators very helpful so it doesn't matter to much.
2662|I contacted Spark energy as I am a new tenant and I wanted to move into a cheaper supplier. I am satisfied with the employee that I spoke as he did exactly what I asked without 100 questions why are you leaving and blah blah and he explained me what I had to do and what they will do now.  Thank you for that. 
2663|It was great!These people know how to do their job and I am really impressed!Thank you
2664|Scott was very helpful. He answered all my questions and was fast and friendly.
2665|The advisor from spark was very helpful
2666|The employee who took care of my query was very helpful and always keen to explain everything about the account and the tarrifs. Friendly, gentle and punctual so everything that's needed for a great customer service experience! Thank you very much!
2667|As new member-to-be I received my welcome pack at my address but failed to find my Costumer Reference Number. (Although I turned and tossed every page). After a few minutes it was a bit frustrating so I decided to see if your live chat was of any help. And god it was!Scott greeted me politely and was very friendly! As soon as I told him my issue, he took seconds to solve it! I wish every costumer care provider was like him!Thank you for your help Scott :)
2668|"I never submit meter readings on time since I travel a lot and somethimes I'm away for 2 months so every 3 months I'm jumping on ""Live Chat' and talking to the member of staff who recalculate my balance. So easy so quick and save time with updating meter readings every month."
2669|Quickly and politely resolved my issue.
2670|Needed to verify what rate I was on, and found that the 'chat' was answered very quickly, and then the matter was dealt with fast and efficiently.  Thank you.Query now as to why I have not received a bill recently, and so that need addressing.
2671|Spark has been my supplier for almost two years, and service has always been smooth and trouble free.  When opening, closing (I've left the UK), and managing my account in the meantime, the customer service reps have always been pleasant, prompt, responsive and efficient.  It can take some time to reach a live customer service rep, but I have usually been able to resolve matters quickly on the website or via live chat with a minimum of inconvenience.  I would choose them as a supplier in the future and would recommend them.
2672|I needed some help with a question about my meter.  The Chat Operator was quick to pick up my request for assistance. He was clear in his answers and helpful with advice.Much better than waiting in a phone queue! 
2673|Really good and professional service, where the operator was able to access my account and do everything I needed. Quick & effective as what you would require from such service.
2674|The only reason i am leaving Spark is because i found a cheaper alternative for the amount of electricity i use. The customer service here has always been above excellent and today the advisor proved that again to me. Some of the big boys could do with taking some notes from whoever is training these customer reps at Spark because they are spot on, friendly, helpful and above all get you the exact information you are after with minimal fuss but security still high.
2675|Scott was very helpful and helped me get my account up and running, prior to our chat I was considering changing energy supplier as I hadn't heard anything about my account for several weeks. Scott sorted it out very quickly and was thorough.
2676|Helpful. Answered my questions. Won't recommend though because I have just started with Spark. It will take a bit more work to prove themselves.
2677|the online chat was very easy to use and the man was very helpful. i got all the information i needed and everything was resolved as needed
2678|Was expecting a call back from Spark but when nothing materialised I decided to try the chat facility.  It was really quick and easy and my final bill was sorted far more painlessly than on the phone!  Would definitely use this facility again.
2679|It was very helpful and really nice It was very helpful and really niceIt was very helpful and really nice 
2680|just used the live chat function and spoke with an advisor He was extremely helpful and provided the information i required extremely promptly! Always been very happy with Spark and am on the best possible plan as i have been now for near 2 years. The advance saver plan is great as we have a large family so we are never paying more each month it is a steady amount throught the year.
2681|Quick, efficient, cheerful response to my muddle and a simple solution. Very well done!
2682|Each time ive contacted Spark, the customer service team have been great. When i've called in, its taken quite sometime to get through but once i have, they have resolved my queries quickly and efficiently. It's even easier to use the online chat, with the same outcome. Thanks guys!
2683|I had read horror stories about Spark energy and was very worried when Foxton's cheekily assigned them to me. I guess they are trying hard to improve because my experience with them thus far was flawless.
2684|I chatted with an advisor called Scott.  I have recently moved into a property previously supplied by Spark.  Scott helped me set up a new account, a new online account and a direct debit plan.  He was polite and patient throughout and dealt with all my queries.Thanks!
2685|Really like the Live Chat function. Quick and easy to get answers and the advisor was very friendly. Also great that you receive the transcript afterwards. Spark can be a little annoying at times (for example raising direct debit automatically) but this function I like!
2686|Very helpful staff, online chat works great and I always get assistance in whatever issue i have. They are very prompt in their reply and polite, I have sorted all my problems or doubts through the online chat.Very satisfied! 
2687|Nice guy, quick and easy to get the answer.Thanks
2688|The operator was helpful and answered all my questions in a polite and friendly manner. Very good service.
2689|Each month I send meter readings, and check my Account. I never agree the balance, but a Chat and you explain that the account is not up to date. I'm happy with that.  
2690|I was really appreciated that the advisor helped me with my bills to be sorted out after my energy consumption was overestimated. His service was rapid and he seemed to me that he is doing his job very well. I am just disappointed with the higher prices of Spark Energy compared to their competitors.
2691|i had a problem which was dealt with promptly and well.
2692|the online chat is the best ive used with any company,you get someone straight away and theyve managed to sort all my issues,i even got stoppped once so they rang me to conclude the problem which i thought was very good! never got that with british gas.overall im very pleased with spark !
2693|Pros: Live chat enables you to contact staff online between 8am-8pm, rather convenient. Staff are mostly helpful. There are a number of options for paying including online and over the phone.Cons: Web chats can be very slow depending on the complexity of the enquiry and the knowledge of the member of staff. As first time users it would have been advantageous to have more user guidance when setting up the account instead of having to try and chase things up late at night. In our case the hardware provided is also unsatisfactory - Spark energy have been the supplier at this address previously yet we are advised that the meters fitted only allow us to top-up by going directly into a shop (remember the various payment options available? depends on how lucky you are).Verdict so far: some helpful staff but generally an unhelpful provider.
2694|Was very helpful and enthusiastic. Did what I needed to do very quickly and efficiently
2695|Easy enough to close my account over Chat.  
2696|I did not have to wait long for a response on chat .The person was helpful and my question answered.The online chat option is much esier than a costly telephone call having to wait in a queue
2697|great service thanks 
2698|I'm new to Spark but so far experience is great. Customer service is available to speak within seconds and they are super helpful! Looking forward to use Spark for long time!
2699|Very good service. Fast and easy. Kind person and very simple to connect and use. I like very much this service and I'll recomment to all my friends.For closing an account, i have spend only a few minutes. Very Very good!!
2700|it was very helpful to have a chat with staff member. the information they gave me was very valuable and clarified every thing for me. I would highly recommend this to my friends and family .
2701|very helpful online chatting staff. Did what I expected and much more as I was chasing my final bills of a closed account. 10 stars for his professional knowledge and great customer service! Definitely recommend to anyone who cares about the personal touch from their energy suppliers.
2702|Had an email from Spark Energy asking me yet again to increase my Direct Debit which I knew not to be right so I used the Live Chat and the advisor sorted it all out in no time! The Live Chat definitely beats being on hold in a phone queue for ages! And rather then increase my Direct Debit we reduced it :) 
2703|Very pleased, resolved problem quickly and easily and staff very polite and friendly.
2704|Enquired about refund of money as I was in credit in an account for a premises I no longer lived in.got a quick detailed response outlining what action had been taken
2705|The staff is very fast and articulate. Very helpful to me. 
2706|I came online to get more information about how billing estimations are made. I spoke to a lovely gentleman who explained everything I needed to know in great detail. After explaining that I was on a monthly premium account he told to me that I could save between 15-20% paying Via direct debit, I was just about to set it up online myself when he offered to do it all for me, and within a few minutes it was all set up. I will definitely use the online chat again if i ever need advice or clarity on certain issues surrounding my bills or account.
2707|I spoke to someone in the online chat facility and was very pleased with his prompt and courteous response. I wanted to change my bank details for direct debit which was very straight forward and also double check where and when a refund would be made on my account. He was very helpful in this matter and confirmed that my details had been changed and that the refund would be going in to my new account. A very quick and easy way to get concerns dealt with.
2708|The staff member I chatted to was very professional and friendly and quickly answered my question about a bill. 
2709|I talked to Scott about my current bill, details of my direct debit and moving home. He offered clear, honest, helpful advise on my situation. I wasn't left waiting ages for a response and got everything I needed in the space of about 5 minutes. Good service.
2710|Information is clear, customer service is excellent, and electricity is electricity.Spark are a refreshing break from the tiresome efforts of dealing with alternative providers for home energy.Their live web chat is particularly brilliant and deal with account related queries quickly, accurately and in a friendly manner, even at 8am when I haven't had my morning coffee yet!Their website is clean, modern, very easy to use, and importantly for me as I'm busy and on the go, it's mobile friendly.
2711|What a super efficient service. The representative was most helpful and all of my queries were tackled with true professionalism. It is so good to have the personal touch that Spark Energy representatives provide, striking a great balance between being friendly and getting down to the business. I have taken part in online chat with Spark on a couple of occasions and I am totally satisfied with their help. I would not hesitate to recommend Spark to friends and family.
2712|Scott was very helpful, speedy, and clear. Would reccomend this service, especially as I did not have to wait and was not put on hold. 
2713|tried to increase my bill from 150 to 213 - inaccurate readings taken by operator
2714|Was having problems paying my final bill through my account, one quick chat conversation with the chat team and they management to resolve the issue and get my payment sorted.Very helpful.
2715|efficient, quick and helpful. Spent only 5 mins setting up account via chat session.
2716|Gret help from person i cheted to. Get all the information u asked for. 
2717|Thanks C. for helping - all questions dealt with perfectly. See if IT can ping up a notice when you submit a new meter reading confirming that it's been accepted. thanks again!

2719|I had a problem entering meter readings today and the complaint was handled and resolved with impressive speed
2720|The advisor helped me with everything I needed, was patient with me while I got my meter readings, explained everything to me when asked, and also helped me set up direct debit payments. Great customer service all around.
2721|The advisor was who I spoke with, he was polite and extremely helpful. Solved my problem very quickly. Have used this service before and would recommend Spark to everyone.
2722|he is good and very fast for answer my inquiry and he explain every thing for me .i want to tell him very thanks to help me . 
2723|Although have had some small issues with incorrect estimates, things have adapted smoothly so far - though have only just started with them - all the online message-chats I've had with their representatives have been pleasant with no problems at all, so far - hence the 5-star rating.  We'll see how things go...
2724|Spoke to Scott absolute pleasure was really helpful and was able to give me all the info I needed within a few minutes really good guy great customer service
2725|the operator was really nice and helpful. i could definitely rely on their help all the time.
2726|I had a problem and you helped very quickly. All was sort out so thanks. It was a problem with your system which increased the amount of our payments automaticaly by error. All good now thanks. 
2727|online services not up to standard, slow to update bills when meter readings submitted , had to ask them to pay back credit on account.
2728|The person that I was put in contact with was very helpful, friendly and willing to make my life easier by taking readings and setting things up on my behalf. This was an excellent customer experience and is the kind of service many companies could learn from.
2729|no fuss, answered everything
2730|Really helpful. Explained clesrly my credit status and also arranged for me to receive some money back. Really pleased with the service thank you
2731|Online chat person was polite, pleasant and resolved my account switch query to my satisfaction. I am very satisfied with the support received in all regards.

2739|Speedy and efficient resolution for my refund query... all live chats experienced have been this way so full marks every time. 
2740|Fast and efficient service provided by chat on line service. Explained everything I need to know.
2741|The response to the live chat login was immediate. I was impressed. The operator was courteous and helpful and answered my questions without hesitation, deviation or repetition. It's got to be better than a phone call where you have to fight your way through the automatic attendant only to be left listening to music on hold for ages. I would highly recommend these people. :-)
2742|Used the online chat. It was very quick and easy to use, with the person I was messaging being very helpful and patient. Would definitely recommend as was quick and easy.
2743|It was good and I got the details so fast. and All the answers are provided to me with full details. It was so quick for me rather than waiting on the phone.
2744|My latest bill was not showing on my account. The adviser was very prompt and friendly when dealing with my request. He understood my problem and offered to investigate it further with the billing team and, in the meantime, he sent my bill to me via email. He also built a bit of rapport with me which always makes you feel better when contacting someone with a problem. All in all, excellent service. 
2745|Excellent customer service! Live chat is very helpful and you can find a solution to your problem on the spot! However I think that the company is very expensive comparing to other energy providers.
2746|VERY QUICK AND STRAIGHT FORWARD. GAVE OUR NEW METER READINGS AND CONFIRMED THAT SPARK HAD TAKEN OVER AS SUPPLIER OF OUR NEW PROPERTY
2747|I have done online chats twice now and have been pleased with the outcome. 
2748|Great service easy to use from Scott was friendly and helpful without any issues.  Spark Energy could be cheaper I feel I pay a lot of money every month and we don't even use the heating in the house at all, and I have LED'S thought of the house which should help bring the bill down.
2749|"Found an issue back in March 2013 with our account, tried dealing with it via the online chat, to no avail. The initial issue was that our bill was extremely high - turns out there was an ""error"" with our account. This was rectified, but bill still very high, but told that the direct debit was fine. Complained about this, nothing done. Later told Spark that this simply can not be our bill , furthermore we found out that the meter apparently feeding our flat was not the correct one. Spark sent for an ""onsite investigation"" to find out which is our meter. We waited a month for this appointment, the engineer showed up thinking he was there for a meter reading - he had no idea that he should have been conducting an onsite investigation. Complained to Spark, via letting agency and ourselves. General lack of interest from Spark. We are moving out of our flat in less than 2 weeks - it is now August 4th- and as yet we have no knowledge that they are trying to rectify this situation. But we have been told to pay our outstanding balance - a balance which is not ours. There is inconsistency within the company regarding who deals with our case. Fed up of repeating the issues when contacting them. Lack of common courtesy, lack of interest, lack of customer service and lack of resolution. Dire company with dire customer relations. "
2750|I must say that SPARK ENERGY is brilliant! Cheap prices, no huge bills. You can live chat their staff and Scott was extemely helpful at generating my bill. I would recommend them to all my friends and family!
2751|Chat was fantastic and it sorted out exactly what i was after in the time i wanted and i ended up saving more money than i intended in the process!
2752|Entered live chat with operator on query with bill (or lack thereof).  He resolved the problem quickly and efficiently and within minutes I have an up-to-date statement.
2753|Very helpful using the online chat service. The advisor was diligent and answered all questions yes i would recommend this service
2754|"Easy to enter meter readings online and if there are any issues the online chat service works like a charm. Friendly and more or less instantaneous in my experience.Can't argue with the price either, I use ""Loop"" to monitor gas and electricity expenditure and Spark have some of the lowest costs around. A vast improvement over using one of the ""big six"" in my opinion."
2755|Scott, was extremely helpful. Very quick and efficient. It was a fairly mundane request to organise a move out from my part, but it was completed with efficiency and politeness. Good personal touches too which is always good. The chat service is excellent, it is hard to call up when working a full week but the chat is very efficient and can do it alongside other work, very impressed.Cheers,Oli
2756|I am the landlord of a property. Used the Live Chat Service, and it was brilliant, so easy to use, and did not need to wait for phone to be answered.  All in all, an excellent service.
2757|It was quick precise and I felt confident at all times and with all responses.
2758|Needed a new bill issuing and advice on the return of my credit balance. Scott sorted it all out very quickly and explained clearly each step of the process.
2759|Very speedy and directly sorted the issue in hand as well as dealing with changes in DD. If only all communication with large companies were so easy. Many thanks.
2760|The person i chatted with was really nice and provided me with great feedback. but over the last year, i noticed that im paying too much compared with other companies
2761|Every time I contact customer service I get things done and I don't feel I am asking too many questions. I like the way they treat people and solve problems.
2762|the person that spoke to me was very helpful and understanding of the issue, providing me with a satisfactory resolution foy my issue.
2763|Being able to web chat with a member of staff made it very easy to sort any queries i had about bill, and was fantastic for helping when i moved out at the end of my tenancy.
2764|a really easy to use service..helped me with my queries and very friendly..will definitely use this again..much better than by phone.
2765|As a mum of young children I dread having to make important phone calls as the children always seem to make more noise when I am on the phone! Being able to chat online with an operator and sort out my account is so much easier and stress free. Will definitely be using this service again
2766|The billing coule be easier to understand. Debit credit what we have used or not...
2767|Were currently moving house and its taken us ages to metre and stuff sorted but Scott at Spark energy was really helpful and reassured us about the process of swapping companies, making final payments and how to get metre readings. As this is one of our first properties that we have moved into alone, its really re-assuring to find a company who want to help you. Really great experience and would recommend Spark Energy to anyone.  
2768|Having previously called the spark helpline and getting a GBP60 mobile phone bill at the end of the month I was pleased to see there is now a live chat feature available.Scott was very helpful throughout the whole process and there was no wait time at all. He was able to answer all my questions and clear things up in no time at all.Great to have such efficient service. Thanks.
2769|Very helpful all queries answered Thank you. Very satisified with service given.
2770|I got a quick answer to my problem about getting a second account set up online and submitting a meter reading. The Spark person was friendly and efficient. I would happily use this service again it is much better than hanging onthe phone and somehow more personal.
2771|He listened to everything I had to say.. took his time to help me out and eventually had the issue resolved.I am grateful for his help.
2772|very helpful. first to actually help
2773|Scott was very polite, concise and helpful.he gave me a quick and simple resolution to my questions.5 stars
2774|Spot on only waited a few moments for live chat he was on the ball all the way !!quick and easy. I went to live chat because i could not update my meter reading on line. my readings had been over estimated. so that's why i used live chat, today, my advice would be to up date your readings every month.
2775|The live chat was fantastic, very helpful staff who got the question sorted.Thank you once again.
2776|Good, friendly service
2777|I was given Spark Energy as a supplier through my tenancy agreement but wanted to switch to get better rates. The review is only regarding the customer service of Spark Energy, rather than the product itself, and which I found very good - quick, efficient and friendly.
2778|I was unable to update my meter readings as my actual figure was below the estimate.  I used the live chat and immediately got through to Scott.  I briefly explained the problem, he located my account and asked for the readings.  Once given he swiftly entered the correct readings and I've been told that the online account would be updated within 15 - 30 mins.Good service and doesn't cost anything to do online.  Would use again to contact the company should I need to.
2779|Bill related request was answered within 2 minutes and all sorted within 5 minutes. Would recommend Spark to a friend. 
2780|What a fantastic experience, so easy to get the answers I was looking for.I just moved in and needed the meters changed to credit meters and agree a direct debit monthly payment. The agent was very knowledgeable and answered the questions with efficiency and politeness.resolved my query within 5 minutes. Very impressed with the speed and efficiency of the service.Certainly recommend Spark Energy to everybody.
2781|A fairly simple process, and dealt with well by the representative, although his grammar left a little to be desired - your and you're should not be confused! I am not very pleased that it may take up to 28 days to process the refund though - another example of a corporate body holding on to customers funds in order to profit from interest, etc. It is particularly galling as I have the ability via my bank account to make instant transfers to other accounts, and receive funds likewise (paypal or credit cards are good examples of this). In summary, Rep - Good, Service - Quick, Refund Timescale - Appalling.
2782|So psed with my on line chat. My operator went the extra mile with my requesr to increase my monthly DD.He worked out my average useage and advised me to reduce my proposed DD by GBP10. As they say every penny counts, so I am psed to be on track with my payments and save money. Thank you.
2783|very prompt in doing it 
2784|Scott was very helpful and efficient at solving my problem. Preventing me from wasting undue time on the telephone. Many thanks.
2785|Just moved to my new house so I am currently changing energy suppliers. EDF was too expensive. Contacted Spark Energy online. They were really helpful and clear about the different packages they offer. I have contacted today to ensure the change of supply was still going ahead as agreed. Although they had not set up my DD (which is compulsory for the plan I am on), Scott from Spark Energy did it for me in few seconds. Very happy with the professionalism and efficiency of the service.
2786|Very good customer service and friendly staff (Scott).Ramez Qusous 
2787|The person I spoke to was very helpful and got my problem sorted out.also I would tell my friends and family about spark.
2788|efficient and polite service. i particular the chat feature and the response time is excellent.
2789|very quick and efficient and it was sorted via live chat which only took a few minutes. this was very quick customer service. Brilliant well done
2790|Excellent service very helpful
2791|Good reliable service. While abroad sorted my readings and bill with the online chat function. Thanks
2792|The advisor just helped me with a pretty big bill/meter reading mixup problem (due to my own mistake) and he was extremely helpful, friendly, and quick to help. Every time I've had to call up or chat with Spark Energy they've been consistently friendly, super helpful and understanding. I would recommend this to my friends and family based on this fact alone.
2793|It's first time I've used this live chat messaging but found it very easy,quick and prompt...the operator was very helpful with my query and very fast with the reply,,it's a pity I slowed it down as I'm not very quick at typing ..thank you..hope rest of my time with spark is as easy,wouldn't want to swop suppliers now,!!!! :)
2794|Needed to sign up for direct debit but had conflicting gas meter readings I was sorted out very quickly and efficiently even got my monthly payments down because I live alone and work a lot. Very very good service .... Thanks guys ;-) 
2795|He was very helpful, gave me all the infomation i needed very quickly.
2796|Scott got me set up on the My Account page, and escalated a technical issue for me. Took my meter readings and confirmed my meter serial numbers were correct. All done and dusted within a matter of minutes.No painful waiting, on a phone line. Just fast, efficient and friendly service.Thanks!
2797|Needed to clarify/verify some information about my account. Scott (the operator) was extremely helpful and quick in providing all answers. Well done. Thanks. 
2798|Scott was very helpful I was very pleased thankyou
2799|Having previously sat on the phone for what seemed an age I have just used the 'Live Chat' facility with Spark Energy. The system is very easy to use with very short waiting times between responses. The person (I know I should mention names BUT it was Scott and he was particularly helpful) on the other end was efficient and solved my issues. I would recommend this system to anyone. Whilst I would prefer to talk to someone waiting times are often long and frustrating and you can start your conversation in the wrong frame of mind. This system is quick and efficient.
2800|Used online chat for the first time and talked with an advisor called Scott. He was polite and answered all my questions. It was all quick and easy to use. I will use the online chat again. 
2801|Great customer service by chap, very happy with Spark energy, keep up the good work.
2802|Generally pleased, good prices and held down for longer than I expected. Web service is getting better. Only annoyance is the long billing cycle  invoices are sent quite far apart and a fair time in the future.Customer service on the web chat is very good, by far the easiest way to get anything sorted and you keep a written record too!
2803|as a deaf person I found this service very helpful and didn't need to get someone to do it for me.I would recommend it to family and friends
2804|Although the Customer Service consultant was helpful and efficient, I am still left with a sour taste in my mouth due to an unexpected high energy bill. This, I am told, is as a result of estimates not being accurate.
2805|Problem cleared in minutes,many thanks to the agent for all his assistance
2806|Got unbelievably high first bill. Sinking heart! Rather than ring (had too many bad experiences with utilities), chose online chat option. Instant response. Swift intelligent exchanges, and problem satisfactorily resolved in good time. Probably took longer overall than some phone calls, but I was able to get on with my life while it was going on. Very happy customer.
2807|Very happy with the level of support received through using Spark Energy's online chat service. Quick response and helpful suggestions.
2808|It makes a  change to be able to communicate with a friendly figure on the other side of the dilemma, and better that they're always prepared to go the extra mile to resolve any issues.  I have already started spreading the word,  and shall continue to do so. Hallelujah.......i have seen the light,  (energy supplied by Sparkenergy and a 40w bulb used in the process)
2809|Second time I used the chat function and the services is quick and very friendly. No issues compared to traditional telephone based services as long as you have access to an computer and a few minutes spare time. I can really recommend this service from Spark Energy.
2810|I like the live chat option to clear up issues. There are the occasional mistakes on my account but its usually rectified quickly and easily via the live chat.
2811|"I have found the operators of both of the above to be very helpful and they have sorted out the problems.The only fault I can find is that I should not have problems in the first place and find the bill and means of payment a little confusing. I do pay direct debit and have just let the company get on with it, but when checking I found the gas wasn't on the same bill as the electricity and the bill history is a mess. Although it is now ""sorted"" I still cannot make head nor tail of bill.  My latest problem is an over estimate on previous bill, therefore not allowing me to post the correct figures. It is now sorted."
2812|I was unable to submit online meter readings and a member of staff helped me with this really quickly through the online chat. The staff is friendly and keen help. Spark energy is usually very fast in responding and sorting any problem through the online chat. Sometimes there seem to be a problem with the online meter readings submission as there do not get recorded.
2813|Excellent service, quick and easy. Much better than sitting in a phone queue for half an hour. Scott was very helpful and got the job done quickly.Thanks!
2814|Very efficient! The reply is fast, procedure is easy. I don't need go through the waiting period as calling the land lines. Hope more people benefit from this new service. 
2815|Systematically blocks request to switch away for which they are subject to an Ofgem investigation, avoid.
2816|Very helpful in terms of which numbers were required to be inputed online as well the end of the month amounts to be payable.
2817|looked at my account reduce my monthly payments 
2818|All very quick & easy to use. No problems. Will always use chat window if any problems arise..
2819|Good service, got what i wanted and in a timely manner
2820|Great response. Very quick and efficient. My query was resolved in no time at all. The operator was very helpful and courteous.
2821|I was well pleased to be served by the same person as previously. He was extremely helpful and professional as usual.
2822|The staff member was very helpful answered all my questions and provide me with good suggestions, and I had a lot of questions to ask, very friendly and precise, I was really impressed, my balance was calculated and payment was  updated to suit my electricity usage within minutes. 
2823|I got confused with lots of things and needed to correct my meter reading. After contacting the online customer service, I really feel I should have done this ages ago! It was so helpful and guided me through everything. 
2824|Asked for some assistance with a switch over estimate which was wrong, got some great service from somebody who was knowledgeable of the issue, and solved it whilst online, very good service.
2825|I received very quick answer for my problem with the bill online by using the live chat. Very happy with the service in that sense.
2826|I submitted a metre reading and realised I was overpaying.  Making contact with Spark Energy was easy, a new payment plan was arranged and a refund for my overpayments was agreed!  Very happy with their customer service. 
2827|I had an online chat with the advisor who helped me with all enquiries I had. Also, it seemed that my account had technical issues and he resolved them straight forward. Very helpful and friendly.
2828|Had some issues with my address and Mr. Scott was very helpful. Thanks.
2829|I was trying to use the website, which was not working well, and tried the Chat option, where the advisor helped me promptly and efficiently.We got everything sorted out in minutes!
2830|helped by Scott today which went well. but annoyed that my online accoutn still shows i am on introductory tariff and you are sending me bill sfor cash even though i set up a direct debit and my account has been debited GBP60
2831|Fast response to a query - if only other companies were as easy todeal with!  
2832|"Very useful ""live chat"" customer service with quick responses to questions and friendly and helpful staff"
2833|response was exactly what I expectedquickly and very clear
2834|Unfortunately I have had nothing but problems with Spark for a few years now. One minute telling me I'm due a refund of GBP2,000 then telling me I'm in the red by a few hundred. It's a shame as their staff have always been friendly and tried to help but for whatever reason I have had nothing by issues and very unclear bills etc.Will not recommend them to anyone. 
2835|I received a good help, fast and quick. Unluckly I can't do what I want immidiatly but the staff help me with the information that I need for do it in another moment. 
2836|Very Helpful and prompt service
2837|Always so helpful and efficient every time I have been in touch :) thank you!
2838|Very quick and easy, understood my problem and resolved it very quickly for me. Very happy with the service I will use it again knowing if I have a problem with anything it will be dealt with quickly and hassle free. Many thanks Spark team 
2839|The new chat service is extremely efficient and provides ease and flexibility to manage the account. Scott was very helpful and quick in processing my account closure request!
2840|I used the live chat and received a response immediately. The contact was very helpful and made sure my query was seen to asap. As a result, the issue I had is now fixed and I would thoroughlly recommend using this service in future. 
2841|Member of stafff sorted my logging in problem out being both polite and efficient
2842|I had a meter reading problem, I contacted spark energy through their online chat service and was speaking to an advisor in less then a minute. The advisor was very helpful and managed sort out my problem in a speedy time.Overall great customer service!   
2843|The staff who was assisting me was excellent and he helped me to sort out my issue within a minute. He was kind and costumer friendly. I recommend all to use chat services to resolve issues you have.
2844|Uploaded the latest metre readings and got the balance in less than 1 minutes. 
2845|Used Spark energy because it was already set up when I moved into the rental property. Seems fine but website is a bit 'clunky' to navigate and entering meter readings was problematic at times. Customer service very good - would I recommend to others? No because not the cheapest or easiest to navigate but it was fine for a 'port in a storm'.
2846|Had to contact the advisor today regarding problems encountered with our electricity meter... The service provided was quick efficient and I found him to be knowledgeable and efficient.... Great service today from Spark Energy .... Thank you
2847|I've had to use SPARK after moving into a flat as the previous tenants had been using it, but after reading about their terrible reviews, I've tried to switch to another company. However after giving them the meter reading and requesting for transfer, they've deliberately put an objection to the transfer by saying reading wasn't provided. After many more delays and long arduous battles and bill corrections which by the way you really want to check again and again and again as they get it so wrong, account was transferred. Only to find out 20 months later, they suddenly bill me 650 pounds.I talked to their agent asking what this is and they are not interested in listening to your questions but just asked me to pay. At one point she said, just ignore the dates on the bill and pay.Think again before joining them
2848|The advisor was very helpful today and when I accidently cut the chat off - he managed to continue teh conversation once I logged back on. All my questions were answered.
2849|I like the online chat facility, it is not always necessary to speak to someone, they resolve the issue very quickly and update meter readings etc. I would reccomend to family and friends. 
2850|I've never used the web chat facility before and thought it was a good experience. I like how the advisor gave a detailed response and it was good to have an almost instant reply. I'd definitely use it again.
2851|Rented property that unfortunately had a pre-pay meter which are always over priced no matter what company it is.Spark customer service has always been friendly and efficient when they've been contacted though.
2852|Have had very little support from spark. They haven't been in contact, promised to send reminders about taking meter readings, these never came. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone.
2853|Chatted with an advisor today about the false statements in my account and he kindly assisted me through the procedure.
2854|I would just like to say i was very pleased with my live chat with an advisor today.I had not received a bill for my energy and he sorted it out straight away.
2855|Scott was very helpful. He did help me close my account. Now waiting for final bill to arrive . Service was excellent.
2856|I changed to Spark energy in January of this year.  In December they tried to take x 2 amounts of GBP100 out of my account before the change had taken place.I Have always paid the bills, however, the account was in my partners name.  He moved out in January and I have continued to pay the bills via standing order.  I have received charges of GBP25 which they say I have incurred for late bills, despite giving them meter readings via e-mail.  The latest farce is a letter sent to my ex partner and received today from a debt agency for a bill which was paid within the billing period.  They were informed in January that I am the sole person responsible for future bills.  This has fallen on deaf ears and when I have spoken to people from this company they are patronizing and unprofessional.  They also have a problem in regards to speaking over you when you are trying to address your complaints.....I have given up trying to contact them via phone or e-mail.  I will be putting a formal complaint with a copy of this debt letter to the Ombudsman and factoring BBC Watchdog into the complaint.I have recently applied to switch supplier.  It will be interesting to see what transpires.  It is a shambolic, incompetant company and needs to be taken to task.Customers BEWARE!!!!!
2857|Used the online enquiry service which was quick and efficient. The operator clearly outlined the situation and gave a month grace period before payments would need increasing based upon an agreed plan
2858|I've got all the answer for my questions and he was very helpful.
2859|Leaved this company and refunded money after they received opening readers from my current supplier,just dissapointed they cant generate yearly statement,i been with this company for a year and a bit,custoer service over Live chat is good
2860|The Operator on my chat was very helpful. Everything was made clear and The process of transferrin gym account to my new address has been easy and hassle free.Bills an payments have been easy and well priced. If there has ever been any confusion I have been able to resolve it quickly.
2861|I think is good if you do not want to be stuck with a provider and need to change it easily.
2862|Easy to use chat. Can do at work also on computer which is handy.
2863|Very quick and helpful online chat service. Solved my issues straight away without picking up the phone. 
2864|Internet chatting and quick response, telephone operating it's good
2865|was very helpful,clearly and communicate.
2866|Had some questions for the advisor. He answered quickly with the required information. Great experience so far, keep it up.
2867|I used the live chat today to close and transfer my account to my new home, the communication was very efficient.It is very useful to have the possibility to ask questions and get a clear and direct written answer in few seconds.
2868|the live chat service is great. they are a big help. helped me to understand my bill and sort out my direct debt of which will be taken every month. big help and big thanks 
2869|Was advised to what the best tariff was for me, refund issued which I'm very happy with and direct due it amount lowered. Helpful staff, quick resolution. Happy with the service and would recommend spark to friends and family
2870|Account was incorrectly set up for an occupier/tenant rather than myself as having recently purchased property, showing outstanding charges from pre my purchase and I was unable to update meter readings via an online account. Online chat operator was extremely helpful, set up a new account with me as the owner running from my purchase date with correct meter readings entered and explained all details and time frames clearly. Very helpful.
2871|Was really helpful, thanks
2872|online chat is useful, the service is good
2873|Needed some quick information regards services after moving to a new flat. Rather than waiting on the phone and having the conversation in the open office of my workplace, chat was ideal option.Person I was chatting to was helpful, clear with his writing and asked the right questions to see what it was I really needed to find out. He came across friendly and this is not always easy with few characters. I could have set up a Direct Debit within the same chat session, but decided to do this later. I would recommend the chat option to anyone who finds it more convenient than phone conversation!
2874|Good sense of humor, good attendance, good information.
2875|qcZxVB http://www.QS3PE5ZGdxC9IoVKTAPT2DBYpPkMKqfz.com
2876|the staff was helpful but once my problem is solved I will be relieved they tried to help they did what they can!! but the problem is no one discussed me about my final bill till it become outstanding and overdue 
2877|"Dear ProviderThe reason of my leaving is the better rates are given by another provider.Spark service was fine, just Spark rates are higher than my new provider's ones. Thank you for the service.Good luck.Kind regards,I signed, but ""banned words"" filter triggered my name..."
2878|Operator was honest and responded quickly to questions with clarity.  i'd recommend using live chat as much as possible.Operator was polite and pleasant on line.
2879|They offered me a very low initial rate, but nearly doubled it later on. The web interface is almost no use and they are very slow to communicate by post. It took them several weeks to set up my Direct Debit and my web-based user account when I first moved in. I'm also not impressed that they offer you an option on the website to transfer your account to your new property, but you have to use the phone or live chat to simply close your account down. The live chat service was very helpful, and the employee was friendly and polite.By no means the worst energy supplier I've ever used but not the best either.
2880|been a customer for nearly 6 months but kept checking online account but no bill had been generated. clicked on the chat option and within 5 minutes after giving an up to date meter reading my issue was resolved. and im also pleasantly surprised at the amount of credit I seem to be in :-)
2881|Using Live chat was easy and simple, the operator was very quick in response and made my supplier house move hassle free 
2882|There did seem to be a lack of billing and information from Spark Energy but when I went on the website and used their chat facility I was helped by two really helpful people. They answered all my questions and I now feel really happy about the service
2883|New to setting up energy bills, I was guided through the process hand in hand.  Made the process easy and stress free.
2884|I was having some problems with my online account and in very little time at all the person i spoke to via the online chat was able to resolve it. Fast and efficient service with very friendly staff. 
2885|The chat has been helpful I solved my problem in a very short time. Thanks
2886|Spoke to Scott regarding a direct debit which was wrongly taken. He acknowledged the mistake and rectified it with due haste.His attention to the customer's issue was most reassuring.
2887|Friendly man helped me today . Thanks for helpin me with my query :-)
2888|The Assistant I spoke to online understood my problems straightaway. Sorted the problems out then and there. I was delighted with response. Would certainly recommend Spark Energy.
2889|Dealt with quite quickly on the phone, had a couple of problems when it came to the website, found the online chat service very helpful as a problem solver.Telephone call was good, cheaper number for mobiles and not a long queue on hold.So far (have just signed up to Spark) I would say the service has been excellent. We shall see what the future holds.Thanks.
2890|"I remember when I used to hold the receiver for good 40 mins while a rep was reading like a record player and I had to state ""Yes, ok"". This was not Spark Energy, btw.It seems that tides are turning - not only Spark Energy's website is simple and clean but I was able to set an account in 10 mins on a web chat, while still (partially) doing my job. Definitely great and the way forward. Thank you!"
2891|very well treated easy to understand set up in less then 10mins would recommend too anyone everything explained in email replies 
2892|Always I get good prompt service. one of the good service that I have seen
2893|had to use the live chat option on sparks web site  this is such a helpfull service the operator was nothing but polite and friendly and answered all my questions swiftly great sevice will use again if needed
2894|I spoke with Scott regarding my final BillHe was helpful and answered my query very quickly and left me reassured.Good job! 
2895|Genereally I have been satisfied with the service Sparkenergy provided. They managed everything I requested however few processes could have been quicker like making final invoice. I missed the invoices, could see only my payments in, not a single invoice made meanwhile.
2896|managed to finally get access to my online account. For some reason i couldn't login and after contacting one of the live chat support Operators got my account password changed and logged in again. Quick and easy with no long drawn out telephone conversation. Regards Steve
2897|From the start of my tenancy which has now lasted five months so far I have had nothing but problems with this company. First bill was the only one that was the correct amount but I was billed twice. After that no bills arrived for three months even though they are supposed to bill once a month. The next bill was sky high and accompanied by overdue charges even though I never received bills for three months which was their mistake. Right now I am again waiting for a bill to come that has not arrived and when calling and asking them about it I received atrocious customer service and once again wrong amount due. Bills are wrong nearly every time, when calling I am told a different amount due than the one on the bill, one month I received three different amounts and nobody seemed to know which one was the right amount. Mistakes after mistakes I couldn't be more disappointed. Would highly recommend staying away from this supplier.
2898|Very helpful, quick response and polite manner. Much easier than picking up a phone. 
2899|Having used one of the big six companies previously, Spark shows a lot of promise. There has been some hiccups for me in relation to direct debit payments and the direct debit being cancelled, however I think this is down to my bank rather than Spark. However, this is no reminder service which advises of any missed payments which I think would benefit myself as I don't have a lot of time to constantly check the bank to see if the payment has been made. However, Spark is a good company, doing what is says on the tin. 
2900|"Tried to join ""First Utilities"" as they were cheapest but refused to accept me due to low credit score and not on electoral role.Cost me GBP6 in phone charges before I gave up on them.Joined Spark but bad customer reports made me revert back to Npower. Better the devil you know than the one you don't.Had trouble contacting Spark on net as I used Opera browser and couldn't get through.Got through with Mozilla. Looks like my account refund (GBP200+ in credit)will be in 28 days.Though I have now left Spark, I can't really complain about my experience with them and if it had not been for the adverse customer reviews I would probably still be with them."
2901|The staff has been very helpful in sorting my queries on my account, and he also gives advice the proper steps to leave Spark Energy so that I can move to new provider. I don't like the billing system of this company and some charges therefore I am leaving them.
2902|The agent was really helpful eith the bill issue I had. All was sorted in under 10 minutes. Real customer service
2903|Had an issue with supply not switching over after rental company put in request. Despite not yet being customer operator was helpful and provided details to get in contact with current supplier.
2904|Scott was most helpful and sorted problem out immediately , could not have asked for more
2905|Spoke with the advisor through spark energy chat and he was very helpful setting up my direct debit plan and it was a very seamless process
2906|After many times contacting the company, I used the chat option from the website and managed to sort out my whole account. This included fixing the issue with the on line account, giving a number of meter readings, sorting out the cheapest rates available and setting up a direct debit. If all goes to plan then I have absolutely no issues with the service that this company offers and can recommend using the chat options to getting issues resolved. The service I was offered today improved my expectations of this company ten fold.
2907|Staff members that I spoke to today were very helpful. But Spark as a company are absolutely awful and never follow up on anything. Had to call up nine times in order to get them to finally change the name of the account holder. They also promised to look into one of our bills. That never happened. Also in the past they have uploaded the wrong bills to our account so we could see all their details but none of ours. Worst company ever.
2908|scott, was very help ful on my bill query he helped me find my bill on my account
2909|Although I am leaving Spark due to trying to hike my monthly payments to nearly double, even though we were bang on across the year, I have always found the customer service via telephone and live chat very helpful and polite.
2910|Had my first live chat today. Found it very efficient and fast. No waiting on the phone listening to music. Very helpful and sorted my query out to my satisfaction.
2911|Experienced problem with calculation of bill which implied I had large refund due. communicated by chat online which was so easy and quick I am amazed. refund being processed and dd being reduced.
2912|The guy I spoke to spent ages trying to sort out an issue with a big overpayment from us. The upshot is we have received a very healthy refund. And our monthly direct debit has been dramatically reduced. Would recommend Spark to everyone else.
2913|lovely polite gentleman came on to chat to help solve an online account problem, took my details and problem solved was even told a time spam it should take much appreciated thank you.
2914|Spoke to Scott online who was more than helpfull raised my final bill and requested my credit thank you very much
2915|I contacted Spark via a live chat session to query the amount they had taken to cover my monthly payment. Initially I had been told that the amount would increase via post but having spoken to an agent on the phone I was then told it wouldn't change so needless to say I wasn't too happy about the larger than expected amount being taken. During the live chat I asked them to look into my account and was impressed by the speed and clarity with which they responded. They apologised for the incorrect advice I had been given on the phone and explained what my average usage was and the correct ammount I should have been paying. They also offered a couple of different payment plans to cover the ammount owing on the account and then made the agreed changes. Overall I am very happy with the service I received despite the issue with payment. 
2916|Today's chat was a glimpse at how all customer experiences should be.  My questions were answered promptly and in an engaging manner.  Although no face to face interaction was used, there was still a connection with the service which lead to a pleasurable experience.     
2917|your customer service adviser is very efficient also fast and polite,definatly i ll use this service again thanks
2918|The operator managed to help me with my request in a timely fashion and I am happy with the service.
2919|I had received my update on my direct debit dropping my monthly payment I was concerned as my gas reading was inaccurate after a couple of attempts to correct online without success, i tried the online chat, after a conversation stating my concerns the gentleman I communicated with was extremely helpful, updating my readings and confirming my new payment to me.  I feel reassured now, thank you for your attention.
2920|Scott was excellent in resolving mt problem.  This is more so since I have tried emails etc to no avail
2921|the guy who attend me was really helpful and answer all the information i ask for.
2922|So many different companies claiming they are the cheapest but when you actually find out the numerous different tariffs they have and doesn't add up.I've moved over to spark energy and i can honestly say they are good! My bills have never been cheaper. The customer service explaining everything i need to know.Would highly recommend 
2923|Scott on direct chat was excellent today. Resolved the issue over opening transfer reading and answered all queries quickly and to my satisfaction. Well please at last!
2924|The staff was very helpful. He's worked hard to find solutions about my rate, and he gave me good options. He was all the time promptly to answer all my questions as well.
2925|scott was helpful and it was a breeze getting all of our issues sorted over the live chat, on a bank holiday even
2926|My name is Claudia Tulba and the person who helped me is Scott. I am very happy with the answer I got and how the problem was solved instantly .I wanted to know my last bill and to end my contract and Spark promised they will do that rapidly in around three days. Thank you Scott I really hope Spark will do the job. I like Spark and I might work with them in the future as well.
2927|i was very satisfied with the help i got today and found it very helpful 
2928|very good on live chat but very difficult to catch any reps on the phone always  callback
2929|Used remote chat to talk to customer service, very helpful and friendly. I had a refund issued and my direct debit reduced after a short review. Very pleased with operator and the service provided. Would recommend and use the service again. 
2930|Quick and helpful chat service. Responsive. I don't really have anything else to add - the chat service was helpful but my experiences of Spark Energy to date have been more negative than positive.
2931|I used live chat today to see if I was due a refund on my monthly payments. The operator appeared straight away and answered each point promptly......with some live chat companies I feel like they are talking to six people at once; with Spark it felt personal and I really liked that. He answered all my questions and quickly updated my account while I waited. I would defo use live chat again
2932|Scott handled this simply and efficiently for me. I was connected to live chat straight away and the matter was dealt with easily and very quickly. I did not have to provide any further information and this kept my time used to do this to a minimum which is very important. I was not kept in a queue like I could have been by ringing so happy to be able to use live chat to sort this out for me. Very pleased with this exchange. Well done Scott :-)
2933|Nice to deal with this guy over chat. Quick, informative and very helpful. Nice to see someone on form after a bank holiday and not half asleep...The chat service is great!
2934|"If you decide to leave SparkEnergy and go with another supplier, your new supplier will give Sparkenergy notice to take your supply over, but Sparkenergy then raises an objection  this means your new supplier has to write to you saying it can't make the ""switch"" till you contact Sparkenergy to get the ""objection"" remove,in my case Sparkenergys objection had nothing to do with me, as I did not owe them money, etc, but said they were unable to generate my bill, and then admitted it was their fault  this delayed my ""switch"" by a month I know for a fact this was a tactic to keep me with them for as long as possible.When my ""Final"" bill came I had overpaid them by GBP286.55p, instead of sending me a cheque for the money [as I no longer had a direct debit with SparkEnergy]they asked me how i would like my ""refund"" paid to me as if they did'nt know they could only pay me by cheque in the post  as if that was'nt bad enough, they then informed me they had a 28 days refund policy, how very convenient of sparkenergy to hold on to my money I must have sent them loads of emails complaining about their unfair treatment of customers to no avail, so I am contacting OFGEM to report this company, do not be ""taken in"" by this energy supplier, I would not let them supply my energy needs if they offered it FREE  so AVIOD them at all cost "
2935|Very please with the service in any aspect help provided when needed!
2936|Contacted Spark Energy regarding a query on how enter our multi-rate meter reading online.  Used the live web chat feature, and got through to an agent straight away. He quickly identified the problem and advised that it should be fixed within the next week or so.  Reason was they have only just taken over the account from EDF, so account has been fully set up in the system yet.Instead took our meter readings and logged them against our account so they will be applied as soon as our account is set up.Agent was very helpful and professional; a good example of how customer service should be.
2937|the agents were speedy and helpful, identifying the data required and dealing with it efficiently to arrive at a mutually acceptable outcome
2938|Excellent service, personal and effective, much better than the phone
2939|Scott has just helped me understand and corrected my DD for my Spark AccountHe was excellent and very proffesionalThank you Scott
2940|the website is not very helpful, neither is speaking to someone on the phone, after spending 20 mins on hold I'm usually told i cant be spoken too because my housemate is the registered person on the account even though i am too. the person on the online chat was very helpful and answered my question straight away, no fuss. i'll be using this feature from now on.
2941|This conversation has solved all of my problems. Thanks so much!
2942|fantistic service from the advisor so so helful. Since joining Spark Energy I have had no problems.
2943|i am happy with sparks energy,each time i talk to you,all are nice and polite .when coming over to sparks i could not believe i was going to save 25 per cent i.e. from 2400.00 to 1600.00a saving of 600.00 per year,but this is happening ,still cannot believe this..
2944|Realy good service from the staff at Spark. Had a problem with entering my gas reading. Problem solved through the chat function in less then 5 minutes. Frendly and very quick service and no waiting time. Strongly recommned this service if you are a spark customer
2945|I am very happy and my problema was sort out very quickly. the operator was effective and I recomend this way to solve problems. 
2946|Found talking to operator via internet so easy than the phone due to no waiting time over the phone for someone to answer most appreciated 
2947|The Staff whom I chatted to my was very plesent , explained everythIng I asked , was very helpful ,would recommend to my friends and family.
2948|Only contact so far has been an online chat to set up my account after moving house. It was easy to do and the staff member in the chat was able to help me with all my enquiries and was polite.
2949|Scott gave excellent service, answered my questions and gave relevant information. Quite happy to recommend Spark Energy on basis of customer service. 
2950|for someone using a new system for uploading my energy readings, he understood my problem and explained clearly what had happened.It is good to know that I can have contact with someone immediately when there is an issue or problem.No long waiting for a phone to be answered or a set of hoops to jump through to choose the right department, before the issue is being dealt with for me. 
2951|Spark energy have always been very helpful and clear with the information they present - as well as being in my experience the most cost effective supplier for both electricity and gas.The 'chat line' works very well the couple of times that I've used it lately.Spark energy are very responsive to my needs - keep up the good work!
2952|I was asking questions about my bill. The online chatting service was excellent and all my concerns were solved. The staff was nice and patient. I would recommend using online chatting service to other people in the future.
2953|Trouble with web site no accepting my meter readings but was handled very quickly by a chap and all was put right. Brilliant service and i can now carry on with my day.
2954|Handled well and efficiently whilst doing other tasks. Would recommend them.
2955|I have contacted Spark Energy staff by telephone and live chat and have found the customer service and contact far more efficient than other energy companies.  You can actually get through on the telephone and the live chat it great!! Keep up the good work
2956|I've been with Spark for about 18 months ago, attracted by their prices which were at the time of changing the best on the market and were still right up there when I last checked.  So that's a massive plus in my book - I can live with hassle if I save GBPGBPGBPGBP!However, there is a degree of hassle factor.  Initially their website seemed to be permanently down or overloaded which meant that online account management and meter reading submission was painful.  That did improve, but I still have periodic issues with submitting meter readings (today's attempt was blocked because the website told me that the readings I was submitting were lower than the last reading - which they palpably weren't!).  And there seems to be no real process behind when you receive a bill/statement - prior to today I have received only two bills in 18 months (excluding a number of bills which were subsequently credited) which makes establishing exactly how far in credit you are quite tricky.However, today I used the online chat function to submit the meter readings via the agent on the other end of the chat and he has also produced a new statement for me so I am up to date.  Moreover he identified the fact that I was massively in credit and has arranged a four figure refund and reduced my monthly payment to prevent the issue recurring.  So all in all I am happy!
2957|Used the live chat today and was helped by an advisor, he was very helpful and quickly sorted out my problem.
2958|As far as online help going this was a brilliant experience, my issue was resolved in no time and felt comfortable in asking further questions to gather more information on my account and billing
2959|Extremely helpful, quick to resolve issues and also advised me to reduce my monthly direct debits due to overpayments
2960|I spoke to a man named Scott about my direct debit change today. He was very helpful, discussed all my options and helped me figure out a plan going forward to better review my usage. I was happy with the service and help he gave me in resolving my issue, however i am a little unhappy that my direct debit was due to change by well over 100% in the first place. I don't believe the responsibility should lie with the tenant to solve these issues, especially with today's technology, it would not be difficult to monitor these readings remotely to give a realistic figure of usage. However, with Scott's help today i was able to sort the issue out before it became a real problem, so i have left the situation a lot happier than i was a few days ago! Phil
2961|Used the live chat option and the member of staff was very helpful and very fast to respond to my queries good service can't fault it.thanks again
2962|Scott was really helpful. He did his job in an effective way while being respectful and understandable. thank you!
2963|the staff helped me to solve the problem and thanks for their cooperation.
2964|no time to wait before the assistant was with menot too many details to be givenquite a slow answer but clear and understood the problem straight away
2965|Most helpful advice. Excellent renewable and green credentials.
2966|I received a letter saying my direct debit will increase from GBP31 to GBP101. I checked my account and found out that they were charging me for both gas and electric, instead of just electric on its own. I got hold of the customer service staff and they managed to sort it out for me in no time. 
2967|Excellent communication and Scott was very helpful. I totally recommend to others to use Live chat
2968|Recently switched to Spark and had no issues until now. Great service. I had several encounters with the customer service online to answer my questions. Their response was accurate and solution oriented. Could not ask for more. 
2969|He was very helpful and quick to answer my question.
2970|Great service, sorted my problem right away! Set up a new DD for me and did a review of my account. Had no problems and was very helpful. I would recommend to friends and family.
2971|Spark energy helped me arrange a payment plan that suited me and the customer service representative was really helpful.
2972|I was using the online chat to clarify some of the things which were confusing me about my bill. The person I spoke to was extremely helpful and he managed to resolve all my issues really quickly and identify exactly what it was that was wrong. I would definitely use it again as I have done in the past :) 
2973|I needed to get in touch with spark as I hadn't received my meter card/key & I was dealt with very quickly and helpfully. It was very easy with the online chat and not having to wait on the phone was all done in around 3 minutes, very happy.
2974|Was a good chat i got all the answers i needed and looks as if i may be able to save some money aswell.
2975|Scott was very helpful.  Not only did he answer all my questions, he went above and beyond with this help making sure I fully understood the process.  I am leaving the country otherwise I would have loved to stay with Spark.
2976|no waiting queue for a monday morningprompt reply and good service
2977|brilliant to sum it up..saves messing about in ques waiting for the phone to be answered well done to scott
2978|I was sceptical at first as I had never herded of Spark but now I recommend them to all my friends. 
2979|I had a great online chat with thr advisor, really helpful and able to do at my desk without being on hold or anything. He sorted everything I needed, set up a new account and organised a new bill to be sent out. Thank you !
2980|The online help chat was fantastic. I wanted to change my direct debit date and it was done in seconds! All i had to do was confirm my surname and full address and it was essentially done! I like the online chat because it is quicker than waiting on the phone, and i can continue working on my emails etc at work. I will definately be using the online help tool again! GREAT EXPERIENCE! :) 
2981|Having just moved home, it was very convenient being able to start a webchat and use that to update the account details and provide meter readings rather than having to call and sit on hold.The process was very smooth and efficient.
2982|The website wasn't letting me add my readings so went onto LiveChat. Scott dealt with the issue in minutes and sorted the problem out. Makes such a difference speaking/typing with someone with a bit of know how and a bit of personality! 
2983|Very pleased with the service I get from sparkenergy. The prices have remained stable and competetive. The only small issue I have is with the website and I have had difficulty submitting my meter readings via the web and have not been able to keep track of my usage as much as I would have liked. I would like to be able to see what my readings have been and then be able to work out total usage over the year. This option is probably already available but I can't seem to find it easily and im not that bad at using computers.
2984|The advisor helped clarify the proper reading for gas and electric. Easy of communication highly appreciated. Thank you.
2985|Operator was quick and efficient, and friendly.Fixing a problem I was having submitting meter readings online.
2986|Value for money is excellent - happy that i switched
2987|I recently switched to spark energy and i wasn't sure if i had made the right choice as there are many tariffs and companies out there. After a quick call to them they done all the work. It was so easy and now i'm happy with my bills!
2988|Fast and kind responses. Helpful.
2989|I found the experience reassuring and helpful. I much prefer using this method of communication with your employees because I do not have a landline and am fed up of massive charges on my phone contract when I just want to sort a little problem. It is actually better than my experience with British Gas, because they do not have a live chat as far as I am aware.I was worried that I was paying too much a month, but your assistant helped me to sort out a better price that will work out while my account is still in credit untill I move.
2990|Mrs Collin  was  extremely helpful. She answered all  my  queries immediately and precisely. It  was  really  good experience  especially  in a circumstance of moving  home , which is so  stressful.Thanks.
2991|Scott was really helpful and answered all my queries straight away and sorted everything out for me via web chat which was really quick and easy to use rather than ringing up. thanks :)
2992|Very efficiently solved my problem within a couple of minutes
2993|This was quick, friendly and I got the answers I was looking for. Much better than being stuck on the phone or waiting for an email to come back. Will use it again.
2994|I switched to Spark after using the Money Saving Expert savings calculator, but I hesitated because it said they'd had a few bad customer service reviews (to be fair, which energy provider hasn't?) I decided I'd ring up and ask a few questions before I switched, partly to see how easy it was to get through, and partly to see how helpful and knowledgeable the contact person was -- I can't fault either, having got through within seconds to a very pleasant Scottish chap. I've only had cause to contact them once since, to get help logging in to my account on their website, and I used the Live Chat facility. It took less than 30 seconds to get connected to an operator and he saw straight away what the problem was (I hadn't registered for an online account), fixed it, sent me a new password and waited online to make sure I got in OK. All in all, time to sort it out was less than 5 minutes. Given the savings I'm now making over Utility Warehouse after they changed their tariffs and offers at the end of last year (which I reckon to be about GBP100 a year) I'd have no hesitation in recommending Spark. Very, very impressed.
2995|Good way of communicating, quicker than calling. 
2996|Had a web chat with a member of the team it was quick and easy and everything was sorted right there and then, good job  
2997|For the second time this company has proposed to introduce a ridiculously high increase to my monthly DD.Is this inadequate systems or is it deliberate policy to extract maximum cash from less sophisticated customers?In either case it is unacceptable and must be improved.
2998|it was a good service and very straight to the point, sorted my problem out with a friendly service.
2999|Scott was great help and solved my issues promptly
3000|After a few glitches on the website which caused frustration in the past 18 months, which, for a newish company is understandable.  Spark seem to have got themselves more organised.   They supply low tariffs and low hassle.  Live web chat is very useful and gets things sorted quickly. A happy customer. 
3001|Spark staff have been variable in their helpfulness - I've been trying to resolve an issue to give accurate meter readings for 6 weeks, without success, before getting it sorted on livechat in 10 minutes. I just hope I can get the credit back from my account in a timely fashion as I am now significantly overpaying.
3002|I miss read my meter last month, on trying to enter the readings this month the system wouldn't let me. I clicked on the live chat button and waited a whole 5 seconds. The person who helped me Mr C was very quick with his responses. In a very short time my problem was resolved. I will give him 11/10. This is a much better system than having to hang on to an automated robot answering service.
3003|The service worked very well and was helpful thanks to Spark staff for their help!
3004|Chat services by Scott very good! My query was sorted out with no hassles!
3005|great help very profesdional 
3006|Had a really exceptional service via webchat. The chat agent was very helpful and able to resolve my query in minutes:) However, I've been trying to reach your call centre via telephone for a long time now (within last 6 months), and although a customer for nearly a year, I am still unable to contact!?! The agent solved my query via webchat, so no need for voice call now, however I would have loved to have solved my issue many months ago when I continuously tried your voice call centre. I understand that webchat is more cost effective for you, hence I can see why you would favour this channel, so perhaps you need to make us (customers) aware of this. I will certainly try webchat in the future as much as I can.
3007|The customer service stuff of the company has been extremely helpful, accurate and productive whenever required. It seems however that the company needs to have more control of the actions done by partner companies on its behalf.
3008|Needed some help with my readings, spoke to a guy on the online chat, he was really helpful and friendly. Helped solve my problem and was very polite. top class guy
3009|I had a billing issue with my first bill. Having used the online chat facility this issue was resolved quickly.
3010|used chat to sort out the final elec bill on moving out of flat very efficient answered quickly and all dealt with effectively brilliant system. hope final bill reflects the service.
3011|Went onto live chat to give my meter reading,a gentleman was on the other end,the communication was spot on and within a couple of minutes of giving my meter reading he was back having updated my account.I will use this system all the time from now on. Well done spaerk energy.
3012|thank you for your help today. really friendly, helpful, patient and understanding. sorted my issue out with no complications give me a better direct debit price as I wasn't happy with my last bill, therefor made me stay with spark. quick and easy at no waiting on hold. really glad I got in touch. thanks again.
3013|Scott has just sorted out a direct debit problem in minutes for me. Clear, concise, to the point and very informative. Thanks very much for your help.
3014|It was much quicker to use this online chat rather than wasting money waiting on hold.  Once connected my issue was dealt with promptly and courteously.  Spark Energy have improved leaps and bounds over the last 3 years and have come a long way to restoring my faith in them after wasting hours on the phone in the past trying to sort out billing errors.  Well done keep it up
3015|This company were due to repay my credit of GBP166 on 1st April, its 78 days later and after a string of email correspondence, in which they:1. Asked for my bank account details repeatedly despite the fact they collect the direct debit payment from my bank, apparently they have a problem and can't read my bank account on their system.2. Repeatedly asked for my account number, it was in the email title, eventually a manager said they needed internal training as the agent wasn't reading the email properly!.3. Told me today it would take another 28 working daysYou couldn't make this up, appears they may have either money problems, serious incompetence, unwillingness to pay or a bit of all 3. Don't use them, that's my advice, i wont hold my breath for the money to arrive.
3016|I had a problem with my bill, but when i phoned spark energy they took my meter readings and it sorted itself out. Very friendly and helpful over the phone.
3017|Called about a problem with my meter, got straight through and sorted it within a day.Very happy with the service. Friendly and very helpful.
3018|I was with spark energy years ago- hopeless! however tried again because they had cheap tariff if paying by direct debit
3019|This is the worst gas/electric company i have known compared to most companies and would not recommend to anyone we have spent more with these then our previous company which i am going back to in this time of recession how can they say prices are low since going onto we have spent 40 to 50 pounds on gas alone and thats only been a a few days apart from that we did get in touch with company and said we didnt want to go with them and they replied we get back to you we still waiting and have sent key and card back in post just so you understand cold calling dont pay off now as people are fed up of bieng ripped off paticular when no contract is signed which should be outlawed which i will be seeing about when i speak to my local mp during week

3021|1.  can't register for online account management during switch from SP.  Website says the postcode isn't correct but I've tried every combination and it matches exactly.2.  Although they warn 2 direct debits will be taken in first month, it's actually the month before the first month since they won't be supplying for 4 - 6 weeks but they've had two months of my money !3.  Using an 0845 number and keeping you hanging on
3022|I have a problem with my meter key so called my provider Scottish Power only to be told that I was no longer their customer and that I had switched to Spark Energy! I have never heard to this company nor have I switched my provider. How the hell can this happen??????? I only have GBP2 of emergency credit left and have been hanging on he phone for 2 hours trying to get through to them to get some answers.Surely it is against the law for them to do this?! I never received any correspondence from them advising of the switch nor anything from Scottish Power either. If I can't get through to them then I am not going to have any electricity - what the hell do I do??? I am furious - apparently the switch happened a year ago!!!! How can they do this without my consent?? Surely this is illegal?!
3023|Couldn't have been easier to solve my query by using online chat. Every company should have it.
3024|"You can get good value from Spark if you sign up for the ""Spark Advance"" Dual Fuel tariff, which means you will be paying about a month in advance for your energy (read the small print!)  They are a small company and their online billing system is not perfect - it didn't automatically generate quarterly bills for me as it should have, and the bills lack detail (e.g. no. of units, price per unit) compared to the ""Big Six"".However they took me on at virtually the same monthly payment as I'd made to EDF just before EDF's prices went up by about 10% (as I recollect) last year, so I kept an eye on the direct debits, and entered my own readings on the website, and checked for any updated bills on the account as often as I could - but a bill only appeared automatically once in the 12 months! I phoned them after 12 months to get them to review the position as I felt that this would give a balanced picture of our overall usage, and waited in a queue for the phone to be answered. Eventually I decided to wait for the offered ""call back service"" and indeed they phoned back within a few minutes.  They were very helpful on the phone, got an updated bill generated on the account, said that my monthly direct debit could be significantly reduced as I was in credit, and offered a GBP300.00 refund all of which was actioned as promised.So, although I had some doubts about the online system, the helpful phone service has reassured me."
3025|Probably the worse energy supplier I have come across, after 12 months of leaving a one bedroom flat they sent me a bill saying i owed 1485 however i had maid my electric 90 a month and a final payment of 161, they said i had never provided meter readings and i now owed an additional 1485 for usage of an 8 month period. The advisors were unhelpful and rude I took advice from a solicitor and now the account has been closed worse service ever
3026|Switched to Spark because they were the cheapest. Direct debit payments were  either, in their own words, 'forgotten'or were taken a month before they agreed in writing. Ignored ALL my countless efforts by email and phone to set up DD correctly, supplied incorrect bills (having switched my tariff because I was not on direct debit!) then hassled me for outstanding balance even though they ADMITTED they were wrong over and over again.I have left Spark Energy. DO NOT GO NEAR THEM.
3027|A truly awful company that OFGEM should shut down.  Terrible customer service; they don't answer the phone and they put blocks in place to stop you changing supplier. This company should be forcibly shutdown.Don't sign up with this company - you will have no end of trouble and they will do their best to prevent you from switching to another supplier.
3028|"I switched to Spark Energy as comparethemarket said they were cheaper. I had no problems getting supplied but my online account took a whole 2 months to set up. The DD was GBP93 a month for a two bedroomed flat. When I submitted meter readings, the system wouldn't let me because it was ""less"" than the initial reading, which did not match what the previous tenant gave. I tried to ring them many times to get it corrected and they took my manual readings and they said the system would make an average and correct it. By this point I had enough and somebody warned me about billing issues with them, specifically them raising the direct debit even if you haven't increased your usage. My final bill came to them owing me GBP225 which they would pay in 30 days from 6th September. When I used the online chat on the 4th of October I was told that the refund was set to 30th November. So I asked them to move it forward which apparently was impossible. I phoned up and demanded to speak to a manager who said they can bring it forward to 1st of November, two months after the request was given.  This time hasn't come yet but I don't see it happening! Since then I've moved to Scottish Power who've corrected everything and are charging me GBP75 a month!"
3029|Spark has been charging me 150 pounds a month for a small flat. After submitting my readings more than a month ago they told me they owed me 600 pounds and would take a month to deposit. So if I don't pay my bills on time I loose my credit score, but for them to pay back, well that's a different story. They haven't paid me and i'ts been two months. Also they kept on charging me the same 150 pounds a month after submitting my reading which is an absurd. These guys are criminals, they should pay me interest for holding so much money and if i didn't call I am sure they would never give my money back. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
3030|they get -273 from me-273 C  is the ABSOLUTE ZERO 
3031|I have been paying electricity bills for nearly 30 years, and I amazed that this company is able to operate. I have received a bill for over GBP600 seven months after moving out of a property which I only rented for six months. I gave them a meter reading on the day I moved out, which they said didn't 'look right' and said that I should get another reading. I explained on the subsequent numerous occasions that they emailed, that I obviously could not return to the property after I had moved out. I have managed over the years to take accurate meter readings at all the properties I have lived in, so why this one would be incorrect is beyond me. I thought that maybe the meter was faulty, but then read all the bad reviews. My average electricity consumption is between GBP30 -40 per quarter, so I can only conclude that they have made up these figures. They pay landlords to sign up with them which must be the only way they've managed to stay in business. 
3032|I first requested a refund at the beginning of july, then the middle of july as the first customer service rep did not submit it. Neither did the second one.. I was informed it would take 4 weeks for my refund - rang again today and told it would happen in 5 weeks time so.....3 months to get a refund - why they can't just transfer the money back - I think its a big ploy to keep your money as long as possible and get the interest off it!
3033|We were switched over to spark energy without our knowledge or consent by foxtons estate agents. How it is legal to set up an account in someone's name without consulting them I just don't know. They have been awful. After complications with our electricity metre serial number, as foxtons set our account up with a metre which doesn't exist. Spark refused to believe that our metre had changed and said they'd send an engineer round to check. We waited in all day and they did not turn up. They have taken money from us and so far refuse to give us a refund. We have been trying to sort this issue out for over 2 months and are going round in circles. They are easily the worst company I have ever come across. To contact them you have to ring an 0845 number which gets extremely expensive especially as they never sort anything out, so you have to keep ringing them again and again. I just email them now. They are awful, stay away if you have the choice!
3034|Promisses are going away. Never contact you, until you write how you are.Bad administration they have and not customer friendly. I have ogfem informed and also the ombudsmen for energy. In july there was an investigation about Spark, billings, no refunds and so going on.Now i have told my students in the UK to make a diagram about customer-services, prices, refunds and time for respons.I write to the bord of regents Spark, but they do not want to speak or communicate with me.Professor Baron Franciscus Schleedoorn Ziecina geb Wisch MBA
3035|Sadly, I too was put on this company by my estate agents when I moved in to my home 16 months ago.  One should take notice that if a company has to force customers on to their service through hidden clauses in contracts, that they are probably not reputable.Anyhow, to cut to the chase, the first 3 bills were paid on time, although I began to receive letters, emails and SMSs saying that my account was overdue.  Multiple phone calls to Customer [dis]Service, confirmed that I was NOT in arrears although the messages continued.  I sent a formal letter to Spark, then suddenly I stopped receiving any bills.  I waited but none ever came.  After 2 months of no bills, and nothing noted on the online account system (when it was working), I contacted them and they told me in a letter that they would look into it and send me a letter. Somewhere around then, I received several credits totaling MORE than I had paid. It is now 13 months later and I have yet to receive ANY bill, although the online system claims that I owe over GBP2,400. (oh, and by the way, my credits were taken back, recharged, and then refunded again).  The online system has a bill with incorrect readings, incorrect addresses and incorrect service.  Multiple letters to Spark seem not to bring logic into the picture - I have been told false and misleading legal information by Spark in an effort to get me to pay, and they have done nothing to rectify the situation.  A good start would be to SEND ME A BILL so that we have something concrete to argue about.STAY AWAY FROM SPARK AT ALL COSTS!
3036|unreliable web acct - I could hardly log into my online acct in the first two months that I always got a error message!! yes they brand their 'cheap' rate however they'll take the money in other ways - like 'creating' a much higher usagedon't waste your time with this company 
3037|3 months to transfer my electricity, they blamed everybody else when it was eventually proven to be their mistakes. Totally inadequate email and telephone communication facilities. On-Line website regularly fails and they do their website maintenance during the normal working week. Direct Debit set well above my three year average consumption and they totally ignore requests to reduce it now that it is summer and my account is over GBP1000 in credit! Their website accounts section has now been off-line for the last 12 days!Absolutely the worst company that I have ever had the misfortune to deal with, if the regulator had any teeth this company would have been shut down months ago.
3038|After leaving spark energy several months ago having paid off my final balance, Spark sent debt collectors after me to chase an amount of GBP300 I apparently owed. I had to repeatedly question this with Spark who eventually admitted it was calculated in error. They didn't bother telling debt collectors this and I'm still being harassed. Spark have offered no explanation and have done nothing at all to put this right. Their staff are large unprofessional and rude to customers. Spark are fine to deal with until something goes wrong.
3039|Seriously concerned about the business codes of practice and ethics, appears its take the money and run, they could become one of the first suppliers to default and leave a lot of customers stranded. Watch them Ofgem!
3040|From reading the other reviews here and on various forums, it looks like i've had a narrow escape and fate has saved me from becoming a Spark Energy customer. However I found it impossible to become a new customer of theirs, despite filling in their online application form - twice.Perhaps its because i'm a Prepayment customer?, their prepayment tariffs do look too good to be true, and of course they can afford to appear to offer the cheapest prepayment tariff in the country, if they aren't accepting any customers onto it!. Either way, I never got to experience it, so I can only assume they don't want any new customers, even when they walk up to them and openly offer them their business, and their money - twice.I first applied to become a Spark Energy customer in December 2012, and twelve weeks later I still hadn't had any paperwork through nor the sorry you are leaving letter from my existing supplier, so I applied again, in March and once again, nothing came back. I contacted my existing provider who had heard nothing in relation to the change. Surely if there had been any problems with the transfer or if they required any further information then they could have contacted me by email, telephone or even post as they had all of this information given during the sign up process. Perhaps they just couldn't be bothered, after all, from reading the other reviews it does seem that communication is not one of Spark Energies strong points.So it seems that Spark Energy are too incompetent to even sign up new customers, which does make you wonder just how good, attentive and effective their customer services would be in the event of a problem, if they can't even complete a simple energy transfer - on two different occasions.Either way their CEO's office will be getting a recorded delivery letter, complete with printed screenshots of each of my applications, to inform him how useless the Spark Energy switching / transfer team are and exactly what I think of their service.
3041|It sounds like I have had the same experience as many on here. SPARK Energy are impossible to get a hold of, never take responsibility for their mistakes, rip you off, take your money and then blame everything on miscommunications or a colleague's incompetence... I've never dealt with such a horrible company.I inherited this provider from my lettings agent when we moved in last August..In that time they have charged me extortionate  tariffs, mishandled multiple complaints, refused to let me transfer (it's taken 3 separate attempts and over 9 months to leave!) and continued taking hundreds of pounds from my account in the last couple of months despite them no longer being my provider!!  The customer service agents now can't agree on *exactly* how much they owe me (it's approx. GBP1000!!!), how they will refund me, or when they will refund me.  They can't even find or issue a final bill (so I can't calculate it myself!) and they try and blame that problem on my new supplier... Circus monkeys would do a better job running a company.What's incredible is that all the comparison sites continue to tell me SPARK Energy are the cheapest provider!  I can assure you, even if they do have the cheapest tariff, you will never be on it.  And then they will take hundreds, if not thousands of pounds from you before letting you leave.  The amount of money they will make in interest by overcharging people and continuing to take money from accounts after customers have left - and then not refunding money for 28 days (if you're lucky!) - the whole process is criminal! They should be shut down.Do not use SPARK Energy!!!I will also be contacting my lettings agent, advising and urging them to cut ties with this company.
3042|Forced to spark as part of tenancy agreement and they have proved to be the worst company I have ever dealt with. Takes forever to get through on the phone, staff make empty promises and they claim they don't receive emails despite getting an acknowledgement that they have received the email. Pointless emailing anyway as they never respond. Having terminated the contract I now have been waiting for 3 months to get money back. Based on my experiences I strongly advise you to avoid using them and if forced to use them switch away immediately as legally you are entitled to do this irrespective of what your tenancy agreement may say.
3043|The only way to get through to Spark Energy is to contact the Managing Director. Like every other customer I was ignored, mislead, overcharged and threatened for almost a year.I suggest everyone tells the MD exactly what they think. It amazes me that a company this appalling is still in business.
3044|Transferred over by their Your Move estate agents. Without anyones permission.Bills completely wrongNo responses to telephone complaints ( when you get to talk to somebody)People who read email complaints are unable to read and understand big bold writing.Don't reply unless you prompt them.Don't follow their own code of conduct re. timescales.Continue to send you intimidating letters for money while investigating your complaints, although it is doubtful, they know they are investigating anything.There telephone operatives lie to you ( when you can get through)Still have not got my complaint sorted since January, no further forward, although I have just gone to the ombudsman.
3045|First of all this company doesn't deserve one star. I was forced to put something. The same thing happened to my mother that happened with one of the previous reviewers. They only transferred electricity and not gas and never informed her until it was too late. According to my mother they didn't transfer the gas from eon because she is a heavy user. What the hell does that mean? That's why she transferred in the first place to get a cheaper tarrif and she also has a new heating system installed. What difference should it make if you use more gas. The give-away is that Spark and EON are linked as was pointed out earlier. These two companies should be black-listed.    
3046|Mistakes, mistakes and more mistakes. Of the dual fuel only one was (?deliberately) transferred so that I was still paying the full amount to the previous supplier eon (who are strongly linked to them) and the full amount to Sparkenergy.They also asked for an extra payment which was made. When I found out after the first month or so I was owed a lot of money and despite many calls (all costing money) and emails I had no response. It was only when I really started getting angry that I did get a refund- I'm not sure if it is the right amount. I spoke to eon who offered a better rate and I said I would swap the other fuel back again. The account with Sparkenergy was supposedly closed by eon over two months ago. Now they are asking for the whole of the repayment back!I have told them to get lost and have given them ten working days to agree with the facts that I have sent them or I will bring a solicitor into it.They are the worst people I have ever dealt with in my life- even worse than Sky and that is saying something!I had to put one star- if I had the choice they would get none.
3047|Ok so I move into a flat thats supplied by British Gas then without informing me the letting agent changes my supply to Spark Energy. So 18 months later I have had a total of 10 incorrect bills, incorrect meter reading mixing up the day and night economy 7 readings, and a bill for GBP900 which they then admitted was incorrect and in fact I owed GBP200 ! I have not had ONE correct bill from them despite regular meeting readings, they are USELESS and a complete rip off ! avoid at all costs !
3048|I switched to spark energy 3 months ago, the worst thing I ever did. you can spend hours on the phone in a week just trying to speak to a person and not a machine. my friend was with spark energy and was leaving the rented property that she was in, as other people have done, endless hours on the phone to give a final meter reading, in the end, as she does not have a computer, she asked me to go onto the website to try to give these readings, again cannot log in.in the end I sent an e-mail with the meter readings, no reply that they had received them. I did manage to speak to a person some days later and was told that they would send a final bill out to her new address but it could take up to 28 days, 14 days later she got a letter from the debt collector, who said the day they would be calling to remove her goods, she had to pay them what they asked for, very frightening when you are an o.a.p. I myself a pensioner, will report what has happened to me,3 monthly payments taken out of my bank account in I month, I have cancelled my direct debit, and are letting trading standards deal with it, it costs nothing. COME ON EVERYONE FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTs       
3049|I'm never certain if any of these review sites are real, or if the reviews themselves are real, but this lot definitely hit home. I moved into a rental property in February of 2012. A nice little 2 bed place just outside of Newcastle City centre.I discovered upon moving in that my energy supplier would be a company called Spark; not one I had heard of whilst living down south, but their prices seemed OK. That was until things started to go very awry. Bills not arriving, excessive debit increases and poor customer service. So I stopped paying them, determined not to get screwed over by some faceless people who didn't even answer their phones.This went on for a year, until March of this year when I got a letter stating that I owed a staggering GBP3980. Apparently my 2 bed flat which isn't big enough to swing a decent sized feline in, costs more to heat than a 6 bed mini-mansion. Then 2 days ago I had 3 men arrive with a warrant to fit pre-payment meters into a property I don't even own and now my monthly bill has gone from GBP75 combined gas and electricity to GBP245 a month.On top of that I am to be charged an extra GBP300 per meter, plus costs, bringing my supposed amount owed to a breath taking GBP4600. For 15 months. I have no idea how this company is still operating, but I would beg anyone reading this review, for the sake of your health, sanity and bank balance, do NOT use Spark. Ever.tl;dr for the lazy: Spark is a company that will lie, steal and quite literally take the shirt off your back. If you have children for the love of god do not allow this company within 10 miles of your sanity, your house or your kids, because if you do it will likely end up costing one of the three.
3050|My mistake was to go to direct debit. They charged so much that in less than a year I went above 400GBP overpay. I asked for refund and was waiting a month and another and finally stopped direct debit and said that will not pay a penny until they return my monies. Obviously you can just email them and wait 4 days for reply. You can try to call but usually machine just say we are extremely busy try again later and hangs up. Their facebook profile has recentry changed as there were no good posts. Now I always pay late and regularly submit readings (I am moving withing two months so no point changing). Two months ago they send guy to check readings as they probably thought I was cheating. This is no no company - I am with them just because of estate agency put clause in the aggreement (over 30 pages so excuse me I didn't check it before)
3051|Spark energy have to be the worst company I have been linked with - like many I was in a rented property and this supplier came with the rental agreement! They over charged me for over a year and I then had to wait over four months for a refund of over GBP200!! After the refund I was informed my direct debit of GBP50 a month for a one bedroom small flat would be increased as I was not paying enough! Baring in mind I live alone and work full time! Their customer service department is awful you can never get in touch with anyone and be aware of ringing off a mobile you are on hold so long its nearly costs a months direct debit! The customer servicer adviser of offhand and no one ever says the same thing twice. I have now moved out of this property and all I want to do is pay my finale bill (you would think this would be easy) WRONG! When I contacted them with my meter reading the final bill came to GBP711 for three months usage that is on top of the GBP150 they have already received - they then changed this amount but informed me they could not guarantee this final bill amount for at least 28 days!!!!!!!!!! First class JOKE! Please avoid at all cost!Judging from the other reviews it looks like this wont be settled any time soon!!! 
3052|We decided to switch to Spark Energy as our much cheaper Scottish Power tariff finished at the end of April 2013. Going forward Spark Energy appeared  to be the cheapest deal. I know its in the small print but Spark Energy calculated our monthly direct debit payments at our maximum winter consumption even though were just entering Spring  - a whopping GBP241! Thats fair enough I suppose but Spark Energy then deducted two monthly direct debits before Switch-Over without notifying us of the actual switch-over date. Taking a total of GBP482 in two instalments one 3 weeks and the other one week ahead of what we now know was the switch-over last Tuesday  thats in the small print too! Bearing in mind that Scottish Power have also deducted their monthly direct debit GBP210, (and weve still got their final bill to come) its not surprising that our Bank account is almost over GBP700 overdrawn. Any savings that we may have made in Switching have already gone in Bank Charges!  As for Spark Energys on-line account access its non-existent.  Ive never managed to log-on - so I guess that more penalty charges are in store for us when we dont manage to provide our meter readings on time. Can you afford to Switch to Spark Energy?
3053|SAVE GBP300 POUNDS A YEAR! This company gets you to start up a direct debit which they take the money every month then never change you over to them . They NEVER answered any of my emails. It took over 10 hours of phone calls even to get through , then they tried to blame me for not knowing where I live. It looks to me like they are just trying to hugely increase the cash they have comming in without actually changing suppliers. (3 months and I had not even  heard from my energy suppliers which is when I started to TRY and get in touch with Spark Energy. 2 months later I finally get to speak to someone. They tell me it will take several months for them to even START giving me my money back they have taken by direct debit. They get you to set up the direct debit on day 1 and take the first payment. To me this should be reported to the ENERGY WATCHDOG. You of course are still paying your own suppliers as well .               ******      YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED     ******
3054|Changed to spark as it gave a slightly lower price,BEFORE I had even officially moved to them so i was paying old supplier Spark took 2 monthly payments in 2 weeks!!  APPALLING-don't switch to them I've switched immediately elsewhere.
3055|I started renting a property, everything was going fine with EON. Then about a month later switch decided to switch me to them.Problems: 1) They did not ask me to switch 2) They are one of the most expensive providers. 3) There was NOTHING in my tenancy agreement allowing this. 4) Their customer service teams are always on staff training. 5) On their initial meter reading, they mixed up the gas and electric readings and were going to try to make me pay about 10X as much as I should. 6) I tried to switch, unlike other providers they refused as my account had not been paid up to the minute - they don't do final bills. 7) After I paid up to the minute, they still refused the switch - 3 times. and I found it hard to contact them, especially on an expensive phone number.After all of these problems, I gave up, tried to call to make a complaint, couldn't get through. All in all I tried to sort this for the 12 months of my agreement, moved house in the end, while they collected obscene amounts from me with no written contract at all.Stay away from them, they must have an agreement with the letting agents so letting agents get more money.NB I contacted the landlady about the issue and she had no clue they did this.
3056|Without a doubt the worst company I have ever had to deal with and I shall certainly never use them again. Always trying o get more money from you, poor customer service.
3057|This so called energy company is an absolute JOKE!!....i cancelled my account with SPARK a week into moving into my house because I didn't want them as they wasn't a known energy supplier!!!....i then got letters saying I had to pay GBP150 in advance!!! DONT THINK SO!!...after that as far as I knew my energy provider was BG and SPARK did no long exist in my life!!...a year and a half letter i am now getting text messages and emails saying my final bill is ready to pay and i owe GBP222!!!....when i rang SPARK straight away all i got was rude customer service!!....few days later i get a letter send from a debt company!!!....i think SPARK is disgusting for doing what they do to people!!! But believe me this will be dealt with and i will get to the bottom of it!!!...avoid this company please cos they are nothing but lying...scamming losers!!! 
3058|Still withholding over GBP150 of our money with no explination. Bad customer services. On hold for over 20 mins. no compassion just reading a script. Take over a week to reply to emails.
3059|"Already twice during my time with spark energy, I haven't received a bill for over 6 months and had to write to the customer service to beg for my bill (I don't feel like having to pay for a few years worth of electricity when my tenancy ends only because this firm is not capable of producing a bill every month). When the bill finally arrived, the estimated meter reading completely ignored the meter readings I had send them for the previous months and accordingly, the readings were totally off and I had to pay for much more electricity than I actually used. On top of that, I received a warning that the payment is immediately due only a few days after I received this overpriced bill although I had already payed the bill on the day I received it using spark energy's online payment option.In addition, about 50% of the time I try to log into my online account I get a message that says ""Oops, there has been a problem. We are trying to resolve this."" or something like that.If I could I would switch provider immediately!"
3060|"Clearly Spark are not only useless but are breaking the law. No matter how much they deny it.So a few helpful notes which I myself am actively pursuing .Having looked at the tenancy agreement I found the document  to be in breach of act 25.5 of the ofgem licence condition 25.5 c) ii says customers must understand they've entered into a contract.Section 9 of the EnergySure code also states:Consumers must understand ""they are entering into a contract to transfer their energy supply"" and when customers are signing a contract, it must clearly have the word CONTRACT visible. Should the terms and conditions not be made explicit or the customer not understand they were switching supplier, they should cancel the contract and may be entitled to money back or compensation."
3061|Would give 0 stars if I could! I advise people to avoid Spark like the plague. If you have been signed up to them as part of a tenancy agreement, change ASAP.- Their online account management system is terribly slow, can't process payments, and edits your billing and payment history- Their phonelines and emails have an extremely long response time- After receiving a final bill informing I was due a refund, it took two attempts to get them to pay the money and took 3 months, NO REASON GIVEN..- Took double payments some months leaving me out of pocket- Repeatedly raised the direct debit amount despite the account being in credit- Could not understand an imperial electricity meter- And so much more...!!!Least professional company I have ever dealt with. 
3062|I phoned BG to pay my last 3 months electricity only to be told that they dont have a meter at my address! A converted terraced house in London which is now 3 flats. I have had an account/meter with BG here for 9 years.I gave BG my serial number for the meter. They found it on the national database. It was now Spark Energy who were supplying my neighbour on this meter. It turns out Spark had misread the meters and assumed mine belonged to the downstairs flat. The Spark representative on the phone informed me it would take up to 8 months to give me back my meter. WTF!?  Its a bit like having your car stolen only to be told by the thief that they will give it back when it suits them. Rude, useless and associated with Foxtons Estate Agents. Need I say more. Avoid at all costs. 
3063|this company is not even open on weekend. so if a customers has a problem with their prepayment meter they will be able to pn supply until monday. so be aware prepayment customers 
3064|"After being switched to Spark Energy from N Power by my landlord in my tenancy agreement in September 2012, I've been trying to leave the company and transfer since the first week.I was sent my first bill in December which has incorrect readings on listed as ""actual"" readings even though I had telephoned and emailed them readings fortnightly since moving in. I paid the bill after harassment at Christmas time. I was then contacted on 27/12/12 by Spark to apologise and say the bill was indeed wrong and I'd be reimbursed and a new bill sent. I contacted them again in January to follow this up. On 19/01/13, Spark said: ""Regarding your query about your bill, a dispute has been raised regarding the initial meter reading as this appears to be incorrect. This process can take 4-6 weeks and an amended bill will be issued in due course.""On 30/01/13, Spark said: ""We have tried to dispute the meter readings, however NPower are not accepting the proposed new readings that we have sent them. In order to proceed with the dispute, we would recommend that you contact NPower regarding this matter and look to get a solution"".So they blamed N Power. I contacted NPower who read out the readings that they had given to Spark Energy and they were the correct readings. I contacted Spark again and told them I was unwilling to dispute accurate readings. I then moved out of the property on 18/02/13. I contacted Spark on 20/03/13, 30 days after this to enquire where my final bill was. They said a new bill will be sent. They also stated that they had ""thoroughly investigated my concerns"" and asked me to again contact NPower to dispute readings. After stating I was not going to dispute NPowers accurate meter readings, I was sent my final bill.... for GBP22,581.16 for supply since September and ordered to pay GBP22,453.13 within 7 days (minus the GBP128.03 I'd already paid them in December that they had promised to reimburse). "
3065|After finally changing provider, we received a last bill from Spark Energy. We had several tries to login and after managing that we found a blank bill. We were not even asked for meter readings. Please look around and find a energy provider that has some knowledge and skills of what they are actually doing. So shall we pay after receiving a blank bill?
3066|Try it.  States that you are looking for something that does not exist!
3067|Inpossible to get any information from the SPARKS office. My tenant has not received a bill for 10 months and Sparks says it does not even have the account!!!
3068|I think enough has been said by everyone else already, customer services with attitude, premium rate number and on hold for at least 20 minutes each time. Payments taken at wrong time of month, too much money with no warning etc I've had it all too. Only reason I've given 1 star is because I can't give 0. Don't ever switch to Spark.
3069|after moving into a rental property it took several weeks to find i was supplied by spark-unkown to my landlady and the letting agency.they refused to let me transfer- no reason given unless i phoned them- (too expensive to call)after a year i decided to try transfer again: this was refusedi managed to use someones phone and i had to pay my bill up to date before they would allow a transfer so i did. 5 weeks later i got my final bill and they calculated HOW???? i owe them GBP140 for 5 weeks worth of electricity???????i have emailed and written several times now- they do not always reply despite the automated response saying it will be 5 days. and when they do they omit several requests. NAMELY HOW THEY CALCULATE A BILLon all my previous suppliers they would show on the back of a bill clearly how they calculated that billit is now 12 weeks since i first asked for the information i require to be able to try figure out this high bill or go to CAB to see if they can help meanwhile they are adding late payment charges despite me requesting that they dont while i wait for the requested information.AVOID AVOID AVOID
3070|I would hope this business practice of getting estate agents to include the electricity suooliers into their lease is banned for ever. I feel bullied by spark and reids rein.
3071|shame I cant give  0 Letting agency sold me out to these [Insert explicit word here ]No need to say anymore, its already all been said It seems that this company only survives by bribing letting agencies 
3072|As with most reviewers I too moved into a rented property only to find Spark Energy letters directly addressed to me, courtesy of the letting agents Reeds Rains providing my details to Spark without my permission. I discovered that I was within my rights to switch, so I immediately made moves to switch to British Gas. The switch was very difficult, it is virtually impossible to contact Spark via phone without being held in a queue for up to 45 minutes. After finally getting through to Spark via email I provided the latest meter readings and paid the outstanding balance (I had incurred 4 weeks of energy usage due to being unable to get through to them). British Gas contacted me to say that Spark had 'objected to the switch' and I had to contact them in order to switch. Another round of long phone queues and emails and it seems that my switch is now going through after having paid a further GBP5.64 against the 'outstanding balance for energy usage'. Spark obviously employ a tactic of making it impossible to contact them to prevent switching, and then to squeeze as much out of you before you can switch by delaying communications. Glad I managed to escape them, avoid at all costs.
3073|PLEASE SWITCH ASAP. IT WILL SAFE YOU A LOT OF HASSLE IN THE FUTUREThis company aggressively acquired my custom by putting a clause into my rental agreement. They then proceeded to address my bills to the previous occupier meaning I was not getting them. I have informed them of this error and they said they would re-issue the bill to me. Two later I received a letter from a bailiff of an intended visit to my house to collect that outstanding debt. What a fly by night, poor set up company. I will pay the bill and then transfer m business to CO OP Energy and I suggest you do the same. This company is a disgrace. They are unhelpful and can only acquire customers by duping them into signing up when taking out a new rental agreement. PLEASE SWITCH ASAP. IT WILL SAFE YOU A LOT OF HASSLE
3074|I move into a private rented house, i then recieved a letter from sparks saying i owed 40, i assumed that Sparks was already attached to the house through the estate agents, i was gutted as i'v always been Swalec and never had problems, i agreed to pay GBP50 a month DD, two months later i Sparks was taking out GBP60 then GBP70 and so on, I cancelled my diret debit as i could not afford this, i phoned them and asked for a smart meter(pre-payment meter) after a few months of waiting for a phone call off them to arrange a date, the courts were sent round my house to recover outstanding balance, i was so shocked, i'v never had a CCJ on my name before, i phoned Spark's energy, the manager went over my last call to realise, i requested a pre-payment meter and willing to pay my outstanding balance and was promised a call back so he kindly(wishful thinking) removed the ccj payment off my bill, however that doesnt take away the ccj on my name, and didnt prompt them to phone me back with a date to change my meter to a prepayment meter, several months after me phoning again and again i get a bill, saying i owe them GBP1,200, again no phone call back, I phoned a further 6 times, a year has gone by and it took then a whole 10 minutes to switch my smart meter to pre-payment meter, which has made me question why the hell didnt Sparks energy just do this at the very beginning? im now in huge dept and feel like i can't escape from this company, I cant pay my bill online, I have to phone again costing a fortune.... iv lost sleep, cried somany times on the phone to them and feel like they have ripped me off, i'v always paid my bill and this company has ruined my credit. The customer service is poor, managers are poor. I would plead with anyone not to go with Sparks energy. I,ve had the worst time and been hugely depressed, desperate and ripped off by them. 
3075|Spark Energy have switched my supply without my knowledge first i knew was when i had a letter addressed to my daughter welcoming her to her new property and as their customer on 22 November.  I immediately emailed advising that my daughter has not lived at my address for many years and i was not changing supplier.  10th December i received a letter from British Gas saying they were sorry i was leaving.  I called them and told them i was not leaving and was advised that Spark Energy were now my supplier - i told them not and that i was not leaving British Gas.  I emailed Spark and told them to update their records and that i had not changed to them no response from them.  Today i received a letter from B Gas welcoming me back and another saying they were sorry i had changed my mind and would be staying with my current supplier who had advised them of this.  I have emailed B Gas this evening to advise that i have not chosen to stay with Spark as i had never switched to them in the first place.Who is this cowboy outfit who can just switch your supplier - i have kept all letters emails etc and will be taking action starting tomorrow with contacting BBC Watchdog again, the newspapers and OFGEM - I could not have made it clearer that i have not changed supplier and never had
3076|This company took over my energy supply to my small flat when moving in, sending an demand for cash in a letter.When contacting them they made the same demand, without being able to prove they were a valid energy company. They claimed I could set up payment via their website, yet I was unable to even login.The first bill has just arrived, 10 months later, with only estimated meter readings and a tariff resulting in a bill twice that of any standard quality supplier. The bill recommends 7 days to pay, and is the first chance to see usage and select a payment method.I can't see this as anything other than an attempt to steal money from customers before they attempt to move to a real energy company, or pressure people into their direct debit system, with no meter readings or customer care.How does energy become twice as expensive when payment is taken via their cash/cheque?
3077|"This company is utterly awfuL! Only given 1 star because it is impossible to give zero! I was told that I had to have my account with Spark by my letting agents. As a student, their low prices were attractive! However, looking back, I'd rather have paid a little more from the start than deal with the stress, grief, and eventual massive payments!After initial problems with set up (being told that switchover would happen a month before it did, so paying Spark for energy they did not supply!), I finally thought it was sorted. Well, no. Spark neglected to tell me that they had no meter readings, and therefore were taking money from me without actually billing me. Understandly, I was furious and rang them. After platitudes and ""oh, we're very sorry..."" (sure you are), I was finally billed. For over GBP400. And my direct debit was increased (without my knowledge, or consent!) to over GBP100, in order to 'pay off my debit'. Disgusting. I was told a letter was sent, but that was a flat out lie. So now, I am in the situation where I had to pay a bill of GBP27 by paying GBP108. I've complained three times, with no response. I have recieved 'case/reference numbers' each time, meaning my complaint has been recieved, and read, then blatantly ignored. I only recieved any form of answer when my lettings manager emailed them asking them to contact me, and she recieved a response, not me.I've moved my account to another company, and am hoping that in the 4-6 weeks before switchover, Spark do not attempt to try and take lots more money that they do not need. Shocking service, shocking behaviour and completely disgusted by their level of customer service."
3078|I was originally informed by costumers service 5 months ago that if I wanted to pay by direct debit, the normal rate for my apartment would be 40-45 pounds.I am paying 40 pound/per month by direct debit for the last 5 months and I've now received a letter saying that I have got 366.86 pound balance (!) and now my direct debit collection is 135 pound/month! Thats ridiculous considering that I actually dont live in that apartment for more than 2-3 hours/day!
3079|on hold for at least 15-20 minutes at a time! been trying to transfer to another supplier for 3 months now and they keep declining the transfer. They have also misplaced my payment, and also sent out letter chasing this payment to which it has been paid and left my account but they cant find it! and want me to make another payment of GBP100....yer sure, lets see if you can loose that too shall we. Also, excuse for slow service is that its a small company - surely you should do everything in your power to have a good level of service to grow that company. Arranged call backs and do not call back! minimum call time is 50 minutes so far including holding time. DO NOT USE! TERRIBLE! WASTE OF YOUR TIME! COMPLETELY USELESS!One star is even too much for this company!
3080|"Like most people here, I was set up with my account without my knowledge via reeds rains letting agents. My direct gradually increased overly  the year of my tenancy to GBP200. I continued paying this on the assumption I would receive a nice refund when I moved out. My first contact with Spark energy stated I was owed GBP400+ but after waiting a few months to receive this they back tracked and said it was only GBP290 that I was owed. Okay, it is now 6 months since I moved house and I have been told to contact the ""customer resolution"" team to find out why I haven't received my money. Advice do not sign up with these cowboys and do not give them your money. "
3081|We have been with spark since our estate agents effectively sold us out to them. Upon moving into our property we receive a letter STATING that spark was our energy provider. How this is acceptable, I don't know but we handed over our information believing it was legit.Upon finding that our account had been hijacked from another provider,  we decided to go back to them. This was in September. It is now January and we are no closer to leaving. Every time we ring we ate on hold for up to half an hour. In some cases the helpline just hangs up on you if they're 'too busy' I imagine they're held up with all their other customers calling to complain.Its a shame because the people on the end of the phone are friendly, if completely useless. Unfortunately we've only gotten through to a human twice in 5 months. They are also very keen to palm you off to the online account (which doesn't work) or ask you to email someone. Shockingly, after waiting on hold for half an hour, I don't want to be told that my best bet is to send an email.Raised a complaint in October, got non committal apology email. Insincere and did nothing to rectify the situation,Still trying to get out. Never coming back.Steer clear - they're all about getting people signed up but once you're in, you'll never be able to make contact again. God forbid you should try to leave!!
3082|Our (dodgy) letting agent Belvoir Camberley.. set us up to Spark in Nov 2010 without our permission. Without any knowledge or prior warning about this company, we just set up our direct debit for our 2 bed flat. My fiancee was absent more than half of the time, and I also work abroad, so very small flat very little energy used overall. We started getting investigation into utility letters, probably regarding previous tenants which we forwarded to our useless letting agent. Our direct debits suddenly stopped, in August 2011. We had not received 1 bill from Spark since we started but as far as we knew our bills were paid and up to date. We left the property the following January, called up gave a meter reading and thought that would be all. Once i gave final reading we were hit with a GBP1100 bill. I called them up, and according to the meter read should've been GBP950.. which I still thought was excessive, until they told me the direct debit had stopped, and nothing had been paid for 5 months, but still very high which I think had something to do with their extortionate rates and dodgy previous tenant debt. Firstly I wondered why they had not contacted us prior to this about the direct debit, and why they had cancelled it as we had not touched it. I went along with it anyway just to clear it all and set up a payment plan to pay monthly, and hoped that was that. No... they failed to set up direct debit again and I started receiving letters from debt collectors Buchanan Clarke and Wells, FINAL NOTICE etc for larger amounts than we actually owed (according to Spark). i had numerous conversations with the moronic staff at Spark, who assured me it would be set up, apologised etc seemed helpful... but turns out they were totally incapable. So, I had set up direct debit TWICE now... and still nothing, more debt letters came, and my Fiancee intervened, and emailed both Spark and the Debt collectors. This time, they assured him it would be done and they would set up direct debit and clear final sum over set months. A year later.... Clarke Buchanan Wells send me an email followed by another final notice letter with a sum of GBP1093. I read through HUNDREDS of these reviews on Spark, and I am sick to my stomache that a mickey mouse company like this still operate. SHAMBLES. I called numerous times, to be told by an automated voice that they are 'too busy to take your call'' and then cut off. Every option does this. So no way of contacting them. How am i supposed to stop the debt collectors chasing me if I cannot set up direct debit, and even when I do they still chase!? I am so unbelievable annoyed at these people. how the hell are they still operating?AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EXPENSIVE, NO BUSINESS SENSE OR CUSTOMER SERVICE, ADMIN IS A JOKE. CON ARTISTS
3083|"I would warn anyone away from using this company.  I'm sure many people read reviews and assume that things can't be as bad as most people make out - I can assure you they can.  I had the misfortune of being signed up to Spark by our landlords (without our knowledge, and therefore consent) and were told that we simply needed to contact Spark to cancel the transfer of the energy supply.  'Simple' is not something that comes easily with this company.Having followed their procedure of providing them with initial meter readings by phone and e-mail we were made aware a bill could be generated in a month that would allow us to transfer to EDF.  So far so good.  One month later it turns out they hadn't written the readings we'd provided down (even though they had confirmed receipt of our e-mail and confirmed the rates had been updated) so we could not transfer to EDF until the bill had been cleared.  This would take a further month to agree.  Two months later they still had not resolved this forcing us to use their electricity supply during that whole time and denying EDF the right to take over the energy supply.  Turns out Spark had given NPower (the last supplier) estimated readings which were out by thousands of units and was causing confusion over the correct rates.Numerous calls and e-mails later I was being told we had a bill for GBP215 for two months use (I live in a small two bed apartment).  The rates they were charging were extortionate in comparison to our previous tariff with EDF.  Spark charge 26.680p for rate 1 and 20.170p for rate 2.  This was compared to our last EDF tariff which was 12.97p and 5.24p respectively.  To add to this because Spark had denied us the right to transfer to EDF due to their own mistake we had lost the September 2013 price promise tariff EDF said they would keep us on and will now have to sign up again with the price hike taking effect.I have just got off the phone with them again today and was simply told that I could now transfer away without clearing my bill.......  Absolutely galling.  This could have been done immediately after they'd realised their mistake.  Instead I've had to call, e-mail and argue with them for months about just letting me transfer and having admitted they were wrong they've said I can transfer my energy account now and they won't block it.  They'll just ask the new supplier for the final readings and bill on that!!!!!  That's how simple it could, and should, have been.Why couldn't this have been done immediately? Why did it take months for them to recognise their own errors? Why did I have to waste my time making them aware of how bad their company is? Why oh why is this company still allowed to operate?If you are wondering about signing up to this company don't.  Just don't.  They're expensive, have atrocious customer service and think it is ok to fleece people out of as much money as possible before finally saying ""ooops, our mistake"".  What should have been a simple two month transfer process now looks like taking 6 months in total.  And throughout all of this you have to use their supply and it will cost you a fortune.  Don't use them, just don't."
3084|Ludlow Thompson gave out details to the dodgy company despite us telling them we did not want to use Spark.  6 weeks into tenancy get a letter  from Spark saying they want our direct debit details or we would be put onto standard tariff.  After hours on hold I finally am told not possible to cancel. I wont be paying them a penny and cant wait for them to take me to court.  I will be complaining to regulator who must shut this seriously dodgy  company down.
3085|Ive spent the last 4 days, some without electricity, attempting to get a refund on some credit that would not load onto a spark energy prepayment meter. still no solution, dreadful customer service to boot. 
3086|I was taking on a short term rent of 6 months as my job had changed and I needed to be geographically closer. Took a house out through Reeds Rains and 'had' to sign up to Spark. The leaflet said there was no worries they did everything. I set up a direct debit as this was required, and regularly enter5ed meter readings. However even though my account was in credit, when I canceled the direct debit, I recieved a letter stating I had to re-set up a direct debit, as Spark do not give credit, i.e. no bill payments in one lump sum. I was then horrified to recieve a fianl demand from Scottish power who were supply the gas unbeknown to me. I rang spark to be told they could not 'take over control of the pipes to supply the gas'. I compalained to Spark to no avail and paid Scottish power. When I left the property, I submitted my meter reading and closed the account. However the direct debit was still taken. I rang and asked for my credit, to be informed it would be paid by BACS within 28 days.....that was 110 working days ago, several hours of my life being passed department to department speaking to more and more clueless people about when I am to recieve the credit.....which still has not happened. I have complained to the Ombudsman, and If I could I would take them to court to retrieve my money, but CAB advised against this. Spark are expensive (compared to the 'big' suppliers), unprofessional and totaly disorganised. Spark need shutting down and letting agents need to stop using them
3087|"Stay away from this company.  Don't let them have a penny!Having received a letter saying my direct debit for my electricity would be almost tripling I logged on to my account online and submitted a meter reading.  Low and behold my balance want from atound GBP220 in debit to GBP50 in debit.  Find I thought.  Cancel the direct debit, pay the bill, then re-set up the direct debit at the original amount.  Oh no!  First when I phoned up, they checked my bill and ""adjusted"" it to over GBP200 again. I raised a complaint (which apparently holds no water on the phone) spoke to a manager who would call me back.  Three weeks later and nothing. Also, they still tried to take the direct debit TWICE costing me GBP36 in fees through my bank.  I will be using the imformation caputred on this site, and reporting them directly to Ofgem, including my complaint.  A formal investigation needs to taken into them and get them shut down hopefully.  Absolute Crooks "
3088|"Same story here all over - this company is so appalling they are only able to acquire ""customers"" by getting letting agents to incorporate a requirement to use their service via a vague reference in a 30 page rental contract.  Consequently very few people realise what they have signed up for.What they have signed up for is quite frankly the worst business to have ever existed.  I was duped into having to use them via a rented property.  It turned out to be virtually impossible to switch elsewhere.  I set up a DD and they never took any money, simply billing a full amount for 6 months when we moved out, with 3 totally different final bill amounts in different messages.  Forget trying to contact them.  Currently going through their complaints procedure.Tin pot mickey mouse organisation with no business skills or any apparent procedures in place.  An utter disgrace that should be shut down."
3089|I bought a house, and according to my purchase documentation I was with EDF. Months into it, I receive a letter from Sparks, I went to their web-site and at the time they had such an incredibly unprofessional web-site (they've improved it tremendously since then) with two pages of static info and copyrights from 2 years ago that I decided this is a hoax - I replied to their e-mail, got an automatic NOT DELIVERED reply and just disregarded the whole thing. Months later after more letters I realised they are a real energy company and I was indeed signed up with them. It took me literally half a year to get off them and I'm still not sure if I have - at some point they asked for a GBP1,600 payment for 3 months of gas & electricity use... we settled to 200, I paid from their web-site, then 2 months later it turned out they HAVE NOT received the payment and indeed it was not charged on my account althugh I am sure I processed it from their web-site, so they had sent my case to a collectors' office and I had to pay a fee for that. Just last week I had another letter from them with another fee for late payment and a further charge for electricity usage even though I have already transferred to EDF.... nonexistent client services and internal rules that are designed to mislead & get clients into traps. Never ever buy into it. 
3090|"I was signed up to Spark energy by my letting agent without my permission back in February 2012. I moved into the property to find letters with my name and address from Spark energy saying ""welcome to spark"". I was completely outraged, but told that I had no option but to switch energy suppliers if I was not happy. I immediately told Spark I was switching to npower, but 10 months later, I'm still waiting for the the switching process to be completed and for Spark to pay back GBP139.20 that they owe me.Throughout the 10 months, I have had the most appaullinng service. Every time I phone them I am left on hold for 15 minutes before speaking to a very incompetant member of the billing team. The customer service team seem friendly enough but completely powerless to do anything other than ""put a comment on my record for the billing team/customer resolutions team to action"". That comment is then consequently ignored by the relevant team. I have been told ""your money will be credited into your account in 28 days"" on three seperate occasions. Another month comes and goes and the money has still not been received. I am at a loss as to what to do as any complaint I make lands on deaf ears.The only action to take is to report them as a group to Watchdog, Consumer Focus, Energy Ombudsmen and OFGEM.THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN."
3091|We have been signed into a contract with Spark through Foxton's rental in London and have encountered several complaint with the billing system and we were charged into our account without prior notice. After numerous of letters stating, we owe them without explanation I recommend never signing up with the company or companies in relations. 
3092|Last week I called up the online tariffs displayed by Spark Energy to compare with my current supplier with a view to changing supplier. It didn't take much intelligence to see the online thresholds (where you move from the higher initial unit cost to the lower rate)for gas 
3093|Completely impossible to get through on the phone and after days of waiting they still haven't responded to my email. Terrible customer service. They owe me money but I just can't get hold of them!
3094|Very expensive, poorly written bills, terrible service. I'm currently receiving emails and text messages threatening to send round bailiffs for a bill I paid half a month ago. I really recommend you avoid these people, I shall be switching away from them as soon as possible.
3095|I was conned through a letting agency to have my electricity supply from this crew. From the very beginning they were awful. The level of incompetence each time I had the misfortune to contact them was breathtaking. I am still trying to rid myself of them 9 months after I requested that they hand over my account to another supplier. They are bordering on crooked and the sooner I am completely rid of them the better. I cannot believe that any business can operate with so many poorly trained people dealing direct with customers. I have reported them and sincerely hope that someone somewhere puts them in their box. Dealing with them has infuriated and frustrated me to the point where I just do not want to call them or answer their mail. A complete waste of time. If you are thinking of handing your supply over to them: do yourself a favour!!
3096|AVOID!!These guys are without a doubt the single worst energy supplier i have come across! impossible to get through to Spark who provided terrible service in the 6-7 months I was trying to get rid. Pick meter readings out of a hat and stick them on your bill. could go on for hours with this joke of a  company but wasted to much of my life talking to these SCAMMERS, Think the reviews on this site proves the point.NOTE: check your tenancy agreement (your move) that's how these jokers suck you in...
3097|This company is very bad as everybody know. My supplier is EDF for more than 2 years and on July 2012 I have letter from EDF said sorry that I leave them for other supplier name Spark. I called straight away EDF and said I never change my contract. I want keep EDF all the time. EDF said that they can not do anything as my contract been changed to Spark. I do not know how Spark can do that without my permission is under my name and without my Landlord permission either. THis is totally illegal, I can sue this company!!So, I called Spark said change the contract and they said, sorry it is a mistake, it is supposed to be for other flat. So they change back my contract. EDF confirmed now I am back.But when I want to pay my bills for July - October2012, I checked EDF not take direct debit like suppose to be. So I called EDF again and they said Spark took over again my contract.. I said AGAIN!!Now I tried many times to called Spark but it is just answering machine all the time. I read google review that SPark energy did this to many people change their contract without their permission and later send the bills said that  person owe them and they have to pay to Spark. Ackward!  I think Spark dying for customer. Big thief company.!! We need to report to police. This company need to shut down!! This is CRIMINAL.
3098|Quick enough to put meters in homes where people are in debt, but then leave a family of five including a 1yr, 3yr and 4yr old in darkness, cold without cooking fuel for a whole week-end. This is because no key or card were left and did not arrive in post. Office shut over week-end, NO EMERGENCY CONTACT and top up line unable to help. This company wants highlighting in a national paper to make others aware.
3099|How has this company not been closed down? They seem to produce bills out of thin air with incredibly high prices, and seem to have no explanation for them when you EVENTUALLY get through to their company services. DO NOT go anywhere near Spark Energy, you will regret it
3100|So, have had the misfortune of being a spark energy customer for 2 years now and what can i say about them apart from-what a complete joke of a company....first they set up a ridiculously high monthly direct debit...then having heard nothing for 13 months, no bill, no letters etc...i decide i must obviously be in credit, so phone to ask-yes i'm in credit, GBP250, so i request GBP200 returned to me. 2 months later, still nio sign of refund, so phone again to be told they have no record of me asking for refund and that it will now take 3 months to repay me as that is the next repayment date in their calender, and what i as the customer have to understand is that they only have a certain amount of money put aside for this-a certain amount of other peoples money that is i assume? So i stopped paying by direct debit, and now they can send a bill every month(funny as they didn't send one in the 13 months i was in credit!), estimated of course, and for stupidly high amounts, given that i use about GBP40 a month, in fact the last bill was GBP134 for 5 weeks! So i have now arranged to switch, which they will no doubt refuse because i owe them GBP134, which i do not!!! ggggggrrrrr do yourself a favour and avoid this company!!!!!
3101|""" industry leading transfer times for both gas and electricity"" well its taken them 4 months to allow us to transfer to another company from when we moved into our new house (unfortunately our supply was with spark).  We are 4 months down the line and still trying to get hold of someone to pay off our balance which is now getting more and more that we are going to be paying them. cannot upload readings online even thought the woman on the phone tells you this about 30 times while youy are on hold for 20 mins"
3102|They overcharged me GBP2000 over the course of 2 years and I am still awaiting my rebate.  They are verging on criminality!  I would never recommend these guys
3103|Constant problems with Spark. Gave meter readings they used estimates. Start contract with a different meter reading that what.I provided. Changed supplier, gave.them a meter reading and guess what, they gave the new supplier the wrong reading. When I moved to the new supplier, they wouldn't even authorised the move. And all this within 3 weeks. DO NOT USE THEM. and if your like me where your letting agents sign you up with them, change straight.away like I did. Glad I did it after my experience.
3104|I rented out my house in Coventry through Your Move -big mistake.At no time did the sales rep mention Spark Energy.My tennant had only lived at my property for 5 weeks when she received an electric bill for GBP504 from a company neither of us had heard off, Your Move had switched our provider without telling us, we tried to change back to our orignal provider but Spark would not let us.Things got a lot worse with bills of GBP3800 for a year's electric, Your Move and Spark have been no help at all, our tenant has received threatening emails, and phone calls from Solicitors, even people turning up at the door.She received a threatening letter asking for a payment of GBP2800 within 4 days or bailiffs would be sent.This has been on going for over a year now, it was only when i compared the last meter reading from our previous provider to Sparks bill i found a error on the bill.PLEASE PLEASE if you are thinking of renting through Your Move dont they sneak Spark in without telling you, this should not be allowed to happen,we should have a choice who provides our energy to us, and not have this company forced upon us.Why is this allowed to happen, the energy watchdog should stop this practice from happening.Once again please do not get involved with these two companies, its cost us a lot of money in phone calls and petrol.In my oponion this is no different from the ppi scandal, a company that was forced upon us that we did not want or need.
3105|First they steal ownership of my electricity supply by using underhand tactics - refuse to allow the process to be reversed even though they have no contract allowing them to supply to begin with.Then after hours or arguing the toss, I change providers only to find they claim i've used more than is on the meter, I know what was on the meter when I transfer and in the following 13 days I've apparantly used 1200 units - they even sent a correct bill out first then replaced it a 'new' one only with doctored values.I obvious won't be paying them GBP250 for a fake bill...Stay well clear of this joke of a company - you have been warned.
3106|Absolutely unprofessional harassing bully's. my duel fuel direct debit was set up in feb under my tenancy agreement ( maybe they're in on it to) my initial quote was GBP50 a month,  after 3-4 months I received a letter saying I was using to much and building up quite a debt, and my direct debit would be rising to around GBP95 pm, I managed to log onto there website after trying all day, I updated my readings and it appeared I was in some kind of credit!! Yes credit, I emailed to tell them not to put my direct debit up and to clear up the credit if there was any, to be fair they replied saying my direct debit wouldn't be going up and I did appear to be in credit and that was that, 2 months later, today, 23 October I have received another letter saying you've guessed it, I'm using to much again and will build up a debt so my direct debit needs to go up to GBP126 pm that's nearly triple, and obviously there crappy website won't allow anyone on it to update readings or no one will answer the phone, I shall be emailing my mp after I'm finished with this rant, followed by my letting agents, I want out you guys suck suck suck, seriously how many people just grit there teeth and pay like the elderly, I'm appalled and disgusted that you can continue like this, so maybe emailing my mp isn't the best idea because this seems to have been going on for some while,
3107|had a text from you telling me I have an outstanding bill. Tried to phone the number you gave me on the text 01750 726387 [no reply] tried sparkenergy. not able to connect. No account number mention in the text, so don't know what account is outstanding.
3108|SPARK energyThis company should NOT be used in any circumstances.  Whilst temporarily renting our property, I thought it easiest to stick with the supplier provided. How wrong could  I be. I have been told to 'shut up' , whilst discussing incorrect readings with an obviously untrained member of staff. I have spent a fortune in phone calls trying to correct  'previous and current' meter readings(which not one single member of staff seemed to understand). I eventually set up a direct debit for dual fuel with the promise of a better tariff which is yet to materialise, and now have received a revised direct debit amount for nearly double the amount I agreed with them. To cap it all when trying to log on to my account to correct their estimated readings, the system is that useless it times out before you can input a reading and when phoning, all you get is a message saying we are busy ring back later. Of course, because none of us have anything better to do than sit constantly trying to contact a bunch of people who don,t know their a@se from  their elbow.
3109|It is surely a matter of concern that this company have so many dissatisfied customers and appear to be causing a lot of distress and hassle and yet they continue in business.Their promises of improved service are not recent, they have been saying this kind of thing for a while.Is it legal or ethical for letting agents to transfer fuel supplies?Is it right that this company continues without anyone in authority appearing to challenge them?Are their 'victims' amongst the poorest in society?
3110|This company is the worst con ever. They supplied my rented property when I moved in 3 months ago. I immediately made all the necessary steps to move to British Gas, rang SE to give them my details, my initial meter reads, etc. First they did not manage to set up an account. When they eventually did they sent me several aggressive letters saying I need to set up a direct debit otherwise they put me on their highest tariff. Something I consider harrassement as such. They asked for a meter read once but never sent a bill out. What I received was a letter telling me my payment was overdue and if I did not pay within 7 days they'd arrange a move to a different supplier (oh if only!!). This letter arrived two days after the payment deadline! I paid to get them off my back. They refused British Gas to take over on 6 occasions with no reason. I called SE to ask for the reason, they did not have an explaination. It seems they have a department of people justing clicking a REFUSE button the second a request of transfer comes in. Anyway, out of the blue I received a bill of GBP138 for 3 weeks. GBP138 for gas in 3 weeks? 3 weeks of which I was not at home for 2 weeks. Needless to say I rang them to give them my current meter reads immediately. Turns out they overcharged me badly. They charged me for 139 units gas more than what I actually used. I asked for a rectified bill and have still not received it. What I received was reminder text messages, letters and automated calls to pay my GBP138 bill. A bill which was alledgeldly put on hold 2 weeks ago. I'm still not tranferred and very fed up! This company is the worst. Avoid at all cost!!!
3111|Awful company dreadful customer service. Good luck in getting an accurate bill even with the meter reading! I received an GBP800 bill for 1 month?!!!! Cancelling direct debits without notification then sending an enormousus bill???!!!Don't go near them you will regret it! Such a shoddy company words can't express how awful they are, perhaps trading standard, watchdog and citizens advice may be able to sort them out??!!!
3112|This review is on behalf of my mum, who has been living in her property for only 9 months. Within days of moving in she was sent a bill asking for GBP141.00. Obviously this was a mistake and responsibility of the previous owners, but due to to repeated demanding letters she eventually paid up in March at which point the bill had increased to GBP520.Since then she has been making regular payments but in August they sent a letter asking for GBP953.00! Obviously this was a ridiculous amount and we questioned it. Their response was to give a meter reading. This september she recieved another bill which was now asking for GBP1278! They have also sent threatening emails saying that they will be visiting the property to collect this. Considering the average annual bill of a similar user with another provider is around GBP550 there is a clear problem here. This company is clearly abusing its customers, and I would like to ask that anyone with a similar unresolved issue email Citizens Advice and Watchdog as I have done. We need to get as many people involved and make sure that more people become aware of this awful example of an energy company.
3113|To bad for wordsI am their client and trying to transfer. They are dragging the process out.I am distraughtThey say they cannot transfer me until I payThey have not issued me with the final bill. and seem not interested in doing this but rather racking up electricity usage.This is the second time a bill and closing is happening. It seems I am in a catch 22 situation.There is nothing I liked.
3114|I moved into a property with Spark the in situ supplier. I changed suppliers six months later, cleared the balance on the account and received written confirmation of this. Two years later an extremely aggressive legal firm named 'Buchanan Clark and Wells' started sending threatening letters to my mum's house (they never told me how they got her address). The letters claimed that on behalf of Spark Energy they demanded that I give them GBP573.22 immediately or they would commence legal proceedings; they gave no account of why I should give them this money. By good fortune I still had all my bill records from 2 years previously so phoned Spark Energy and asked why I needed to give them this money. When they investigated and discovered there was a mistake and they couldn't justify asking me for anything; the Advisor I spoke to refused to apologise for sending five threatening letters to my mum and said that he would continue to investigate whether there were other grounds to demand money from me. Although he realised the existing demand was based on an error, he was going to research whether he could find another reason. He seemed determined to make me feel that they would continue hounding me, but because there were no further grounds to demand money from me, I never heard from them again. I am speechless to think that this sort of behaviour is legal. They shouldn't be allowed to operate.
3115|moved into property 1 yr ago spark was in situ, moved to another company was in despute over billing heard nothing at all, 2 weeks ago received letter from debt collection agency stating i owed GBP167.00, bar in mind ive had no correspondance from company for 10 month, tried for a week to contact them, when i did and account on screen surpise surpise comp goes down assured i wud be contacted the nx day still waiting and when number is 0845 ridiculious!!! contacted company eventually and they state i owe GBP270 debt letter was incorrect for 1 months billing between moving companies, ive requested copy bill as not recieved orignal watch this space, appalled by spark that after nearly 1 yr later they hounding me for money,m will be in contact with energy ombudsmen very soon .
3116|They are clearly just ripping me and other people off. I have just written to my MP and I'm waiting for his response.
3117|my experience of this company has been terrible. despite paying the bills on time for 2 years i then get a bill back dated for 2 years for GBP3,500! i'm then told that all the previous bills were based on estimated readings. i have never had such an horrific experience from any other company.can anyone give me any tips to deal with this lot?
3118|My son was transferred to this company via his estate agent who told him if he didn't want to be with Spark that he must contact them and tell them so. He did that the same day but was transferred anyway.Having read some of the reviews here the same things keep coming up:Let's see if Spark will answer them here:1. Do you give payments to estate agents who transfer clients to you?2. If so, how much per client  transferred each month/year do you give?3. Why do so many complain about you not answering the phones?4. Why do so many want to transfer away from you if your as good as you claim?5. Why do you make transferring away so difficult?6. Why dont you give the details of the energy ombudsman to clients who are unhappy/having problems out as a matter of course instead of making out there is nothing they can do about it other than contact you?
3119|One year of a constant battle to get accurate bills and ensure my direct debits are not sneakily raised, I have finally moved out if the property. Looking forward to the end of dealing with Spark and their ridiculously over estimated estimates, their inability to print the correct address on correspondence, their price hikes, their random tariff switches, I happily provided my final meter readings and requested my final bill. I was told it would be with me within 28 days, but now, two months later, I still don't have my final bill. I suspect this is because my account is in credit and Spark don't want to give me back my money.  So here's what I've done while I've been waiting and I would recommend others try the same:1) complained to Spark about the delay2) left a review on their review website3) complained to the letting agency4) told everyone I know via social media to avoid this company and be wise to letting agencies that have a partnership with them5) left a review here6) given BBC Watchdog my storyWhat's next? OFGEM (via CItizens Advice Bureau) and energy ombudsman
3120|"I am in rented house and the supplier was british gas when i went on holiday in May, when i returned home after 2 weeks i found i was then with spark. When I asked why it was transferred without my autherisation i was told "" we did try to phone you"" when i replied that i was out of the country and did not give my permission the response was well we did try to phone you????? i have been trying to leave them since July the 5th and asked for a end bill only to be sent for a bill for over GBP300.00 they have only been supplying the gas via meter and for only 42 days. How is that even possible i work full time and don't cook ?? It is now 9 weeks since my initial dispute was put in with them and i'm still no nearer to be able to leave this tin pot organisation!!! DO NOT USE THEM "
3121|"I too have been forced to use Spark Energy. I saw the clause in the tenancy agreement but was too scared to ask them to take it out because I really liked the house. I knew at the time that it was an unfair term according to the OFT ""Guidance on unfair terms in tenancy agreements"" 2005 document.So when I moved in I set up npower as my supplier instead. A month later I got a ""sorry you're leaving us"" letter from npower. You guessed it, Spark had hijacked my supply.I rang npower to start off the erroneous transfer process, but just heard that Spark have blocked it, saying they have a valid contract. Which they do not - I had not signed anything with them, or even spoken to them! I rang Spark and spoke to a horrible defensive man who told me that the letting agents can transfer me if they want to, and he refused to accept that it was an erroneous transfer, even though I read him out the erroneous transfer procedure from the cfe website.So now I am trying to go back to npower through the normal transfer process.I contacted Citizens advice, who have never heard of the 2005 OFT ""Guidance on unfair terms in tenancy agreements"", and they said they would pass me on to Trading standards, but did not hold out much hope that they would call me back. I have also emailed the OFT to complain about Foxtons and Spark.It seems that basically nobody cares, and Letting Agents can continue to get kickbacks from Spark without impunity."
3122|Apalling in every sense. Grossly over priced and inaccurately calculated bills, even with supplied meter readings. E.g. I paid a GBP100 approx bill, and gave another meter reading a week later. They billed GBP94 approx. This is a 1 bedroom flat!After trying to bill for over GBP600 for one month, I refused to pay and the bill suddenly dropped to around GBP100. During the time taken to send the new bill through to me, Spark energy were trying to add late payment fees, threats of handing the bill to a recovery agency etc. I would get texts, emails and calls on a daily basis - and this continued for days after paying the bill!Spark energy's customer service is awful, although their staff seem helpful enough on the phone. When I told them I was going to change energy supplier they lied to me, stating I would need to contact them first and pay fees etc. Rubbish - went to another provider and they managed the switchover with no fees or problems. Spark energy attemted to stop the switchover however, but I supplied a meter reading immediately to counter this, which worked.I would never recommend anybody to spark energy, ever. I begrudge every penny I worked hard for to pay them.
3123|I had previous problems with Spark but bought a new flat and Spark were the current supplier. I have been trying to move away from them since May and still without success. I am just off the phone to them and they have said that it is because I paid online that they can't transfer it. I offered to pay there and then with a meter reading only to be told that the billing system is down - very convenient!Their initial bill for 1 months supply of gas was GBP240!!!!!!!I gave them the up to date meter reading and it was reduced to GBP44.Another extimate arrived 1 month later despite me trying to move for GBP98!!!I gave another meter reading and this was reduced to GBP23. I still can't move to EDF as they keep telling me that Spark are not letting me go because I have an outstanding balance. Everytime I call Spark I give them a meter reading and pay the bill and the circle continues. Spark are an absolute shambles of a company and should be completely avoided. totally useless company with truly atrocious customer service.
3124|it's  really ridiculous for 2 students got a GBP2,600 final bill in a small flat in one year!!it's monthly bill was estimated, but after i submit the meter reading to this company, the bill really surprise me! I will not pay it!!!!!nutshell!!!
3125|We have been told our outstanding balance with the updated meter reading on 10 August was GBP250.  Today I was about to make a payment online and an invoice has been raised for GBP507!  Not to mention we are now receiving calls from a Debt Collection Agency chasing the GBP250!  So.... in 7 months of us living in a very small flat with double glazing, we have supposedly used over GBP800 worth of electricity.... IMPOSSIBLE!!!  We are at work during the day and out most weekends!!I have tried consistently to speak to Spark Energy over the past few months but their Customer Service is non-existent!We are worried sick!!We have asked 2 independent electricity suppliers what our average use per year would be, and both estimated no more than GBP430 per year.I am in the process of complaining to the Ombudsman, Watchdog and we are seeking legal advice from both the CAB and a solicitor!AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!!!
3126|I moved in to a 2 bed flat on sept 2011 and I paid spark 71 pounds a month for gas and electricity at the start of every month. I moved out at the end of July this year and submitted my final meter reading. I am convinced the company owe me money as my flatmate and I were extremely conservative with gas and electricity. So as well as ringing the company twice and sending an email chasing up the funds I am in credit for, I heard nothing. Until today when the direct debit went out of my account again!!! I moved out a month ago fully informing the company, yet they are continuing to debit my account! I have just got off the phone with the company who's own computer system is failing to bring up the details on my account and telling them I owe them 300 pounds for gas during the summer months! Even the lady on the end of the phone says this does not sound feasible with the contract i was on. The lady is going to call me back once she has got their computer system to work.I am shocked by the incompetence I have encountered. Avoid this copmpany like the plague.
3127|I moved in to my new property in May 2011 and rang spark to give them my metre reading, I went on line to see who was giving me the best deal with my gas and electric supply and at the time it was Scottish Power.  I paid of my bill with Spark and tried to change to Scottish Power to which I was told by them that I could not change as I had outstanding debt with Spark.  I tried constantly for months to change supplier with the same result.  I eventually gave up.  I went on paying my monthly bills which were creeping up and creeping up in price and I could not make head nor tail of the bills, then all of a sudden the bills stopped.  I continued to make payments through the website at the rate of my previous bills so that when they decided to eventually send me out a bill I wouldn't have much to pay. I didn't receive a bill from Spark for five or six months and when I finally received a bill it was astronomical and they wanted payment straight away!!They then handed the debt over to a debt company and the only way I could repay this debt was to get pre-paid metres in my property which I was charged GBP50 each to install, this was put on top of my debt.  The metres were put into the flat and Spark had not supplied me with a gas card, I phoned them up and they didn't know anything about me getting a gas metre fitted and that they would get a gas card sent out.  I waited and waited my friend eventually brought my gas card in, it had been posted through the close door, I live two up, their delivery guy obviously couldn't be bothered coming up the stairs, shouldn't be surprised really, so it had been sitting for days behind the secured entry door at the bottom of the close.Anyway, cut a long story short, gas card didn't work, called them up and put on hold for ages, got through they sent out new card, well two came actually and guess what, neither of them worked!!  Called back got another card sent out, and surprise surprise it didn't work!!!Called them back (I'm on maternity leave)they said they would get back to me, after waiting for over half an hour I called them back, told that they were working on the problem and they would phone me back.  Another half an hour later I received a phone call telling me that they would have someone sent out in 10 working days, I have GBP6 emergency credit in my metre and a six month old baby, I said that my gas would more than likely run out by then, they said well if it does give us a call and we will send someone out that day!!   I actually welled up, I am so angry and frustrated with these charlatans.  Please please, do not use this unprofessional company, if you move into a property and they supply your energy, get away from them as fast as you can, don't do what I did and give up trying, get away and stay away. I am currently in the process of looking for another property to get away and start again, I am at the end of my tether!! 
3128|After trying to connect with this company for 6 months back in 2008, we ended our power supply with them in 2009. I rung them with our final power reading and even after chasing never got a final power invoice. I thought this meant we were all paid up and the account was closed.3 years after closing the account, a representative from this company has emailed me requesting an overdue payment of GBP110.86! Their excuse is that they were awaiting the meter technical details for the account in order for them to final bill correctly, the meter details should have come from the old supplier back in 2009, however as much as they chased for this information it was not received until February 2012.I find this completely unacceptable and am of the opinion that the company needs to take responsibility and write off this money. To contact a customer 3 years after the account was due is unbelievable.
3129|The moral of the story is read through the contract.  I did not see the part in my contract from Your Move stating that my details would be passed to Spark Energy.  Fair enough.  My main problem is though that you do not expect this to be in a letting contract as it is up to me who I chose as I am paying the bill.  Something like this should be explained at the time really not just hidden in the agreement.  Luckily for me I twigged on straight away and contacted them and Scottish Power who challenged this as an erroneous transfer and won.  The hidden clause must not be enough to stand up to a challenge.
3130|they charge you for services charge , I asked what this was , they said admin , although admin already billed for, .I also said you dont read meters , you expect us to put it on line , or you estimate .I transfered in 2010 , it took 3 and half months to get RID!!I transfered to scottish power and their customer services said they were difficult and unprepared to change transfer.Eventually \i got Rid !!They never explained services charges, but I always got high bills , but they couldnt explain and you also charge an 0854 rate and keep you for ages.Lettings companies use them , because its free advertising and the Rep sales man gets a commission , I should know I am taking my my lettings agency to court, because they too , are COWBOYS!!!!
3131|I'm completely appalled that this company is still allowed to trade. Back in 2008, I most unfortunately happened to be introduced to this company by my then state agents, Howards, who brazenly suggested I moved my supply onto them. After finding out that not only they were more expensive, but also that they were forcing their way in by means of a kickback for the agent, I flatly refused, and so did most people renting in my apartment block. Our contracts didn't include any conditions on the utility providers, let alone mentioned Spark. We voiced our concerns to the agent, which promised to notify Spark of our refusal. Months after, Spark sent us letters announcing they were going to carry out the transfer as by the alleged conditions of our contracts; I personally sent a certified letter to Spark telling them of my refusal, including a copy of my tenancy agreement showing that no conditions of the energy supplier were included. That letter was received well in advance of the transfer, yet it was carried out; not only that, when instructing my legitimate supplier to revert it as an incorrect transfer, they refused as they have systematically done with many other posters in this thread. My neighbours and I had to get Ofgem involved to get the transfers reverted, after a significant struggle trying to get any reply from Spark; however, when faced with over a dozen complaints about the matter, Ofgem still faced to appreciate that Spark was doing this systematically, and refused to take further action. The only satisfaction we drew out of this situation is that, after bringing the issue up with the housing association owning the complex, Howards was stripped of the lettings management. Unfortunately Spark continues to conduct their business as usual, with the same poor practices they submitted us to. By all means, don't allow them any slack and contact Ofgem or The Energy Ombudsman as soon as they try to hold on to your supply.P.D. As for the token P.R. reply from Spark, spare yourselves the bother and use that time to service your dismal complain system; your customers will be much better serviced
3132|Got stuck with these chancers when we moved into a new property. Gave all our details to our existing supplier who updated the national database and set everything up the day we moved in. Spark rejected the transfer and have since - 5 months in - steadfastly refused to respect my choice as a consumer and allow me to choose my supplier. Continually being asked for meter readings, continually refusing to release my supply to MY CHOSEN supplier and continually moving the frickin' goalposts. There behavior is disgusting. And as for the cost, just a received a 'bill' for GBP50.00. Making this up or what! This 'company' needs to be put out of business.
3133|"We moved into rented property mid Feb 2012 and since then we have are having major issues with spark as they are overbilling us for units we have not consumed and when I phoned them with the correct meter reading expecting a refund for the units we´d not used they simply put back the meter readings on the next bill and have began to charge us again for the same units. They won´t accept anything you say on the phone. My first email to them was on 26 June regarding this (before it was all on the phone but to no use). We are trying to move to EDF but Spark will not let us go, even though we have paid the extortionate bills they have asked us to pay. In April our bill was 135GBP which we paid, and then in May the ""balance from the last bill"" was 167.81GBP. The amount of the bill came to 123.63GBP, then a charge of 10GBP late payment fee (we have not paid the bills late!) and somehow the total of the bill comes to 156.44GBP. Where are they getting these numbers from? When We complained in May, they resent 4 new bills (Feb, March, Apr and May) with new higher amounts and insisted we pay all over again! Stay away from them, they charge what they want, no explanations and customer service is awful!!! The worst is that I feel stupid paying for units I´ve already paid for - it´s on the bill in black and white, but Spark just carries on sending out new bills and when you complain they just ignore it. What can I do? I am actually feeling bullied by them and will take this to the OFGEM and ombudsmen if we cannot resolve the issue this week. People must be warned about them!!!!"
3134|Having Received a GBP1200 bill for a previous tennant within days of moving in, I promptly called Spark to advise them I have moved in and provided a meter reading; a few days later a new bill arrives....for GBP700. Another lengthy phone call allowed me to open and account and provide meter readings once again, this time I get another new bill, with the wrong readings - down to GBP60 now....for around 10 days use.I would love to let you all know how this all ended, sadly, 7 weeks on, it still hasn't! I've contacted the ombudsman for help with these clowns!
3135|after living in my property for a year being happy with npower i renewed my contract with my letting and i received a letter saying they had taking back over. this company is clearly a scam. i never known anyone to have a good word about them. avoid at all cost. last time i was signed up with them without my permission they charged me more for 3 months than npower has charged in a year, its despicable. im not letting it happen again. ive gone to citizens advice
3136|Spark Energy have got to be the worst company in the world.. their 'Help Desk' does anything but.. they don't abide to Data Protection Laws, they don't abide to any consumer laws.They still ownership of your energy to make a quick quid - they do no work whatsoever and are essentially just scammers.OfGEM don't appear to want to get involved so I've taken a case up with the Ombudsman.I've never wanted them to take my supply but my estate agent has given them my details - I'm sure there is also no legal way anyone other than the bill payer can change your supply even in the case of a tenancy agreement that is only legally binding with the estate agents not any utilities and I will be arguing such should this end up in the Small Claims Court.Upon reading all the other complaints listed I know what joys I have to look forward to in the future, Baliffs/Bills arriving years to come charging inflated prices... They have point-blank refused to provide any energy rates which again can't be legal.
3137|I recently received a final bill from Spark Energy totaling GBP400. As a student moving into a student house in September 2011, I quickly began searching for an appropriate tariff with various energy companies, which I found, but my switch was constantly obstructed by Spark due to unpaid bills from the previous tenants. I set up an account with spark to settle and move to another company which i thought would be fine as i had no clue what the company were like at the time. Due to them prolonging the process I have now become liable for the equivalent of 5 months of gas and electricity supply from Spark Energy that I did not want;  at extortionate rates in comparison to other providers. I feel utterly screwed over, especially as I am a student and it is my first experience of utility companies. I requested a final bill in order to switch, I believe to be back in November, which has only just arrived through my letterbox. (28/06/12) I called numerous times before this and assume the glacial pace the issue was dealt with was intentional in order to extract more money from us. From their own website- ''Final BillsPeople hate having to wait to get their final bill to find out if they owe or are owed money so we built a dedicated Change of Tenancy team and built them some slick software. They make sure your house move is as simple as possible by closing your account and issuing you with a final bill, all within 14 days of letting us know''  Ridiculous!While myself and the other tenants are not disputing the bill and intend to pay it as soon as possible,(regrettably) we do have objections to threats of 'collections team if not paid within 7 days'. Having taken a ridiculous number of months to even send this bill to demand payment within 7 days is very unreasonable, as one of my housemates is not even in the country at the moment so cannot transfer funds. I'm amazed this greedy, inept, unprofessional company is still able to operate. I cannot wait to move out of this house where they can't find me! As a student i'm bloody terrified and wary of getting involved with any company now, they are just trying to take what little money I actually have!
3138|Seeing so many other bad reviews is very encouraging. Got suck with spark after leasing a flat. After the very first time I rang their premium phoneline to tell them my details I decided to switch supplier; they immediately wanted money upfront, they couldn't recognise my meter readings and showed no intention to, they only wanted to charge me further for installing a new meter...!6 months after moving to a new supplier I suddenly get a spate of letters, texts and e-mails (Never a phonecall though, they must require more effort/less inept staff) to the point where they're getting aggravating. It's over now but a completely horrendous experience, never sign up for this company!
3139|I requested them to cancel my service with them and transfer the service to British Gas. They told me to supply meter reading and I did it. However, they said their estimated reading is higher than my data, thus they didn't allow me to stop the service even though they have never gotten a staff to check my meter to verify and my meter reading is in fact much lower than theirs (I have taken photo everyday to keep as a proof).  They have never told me what their estimated reading is. 2 months' gone and they are deliberately not procssing my request of cancelling the service! Don't ever choose this company if you have a choice, if you are like me that using Foxton to rent an apartment, do prepare for a fight!  
3140|Our letting agent has an arrangement with Spark Energy which automatically transfers utilities supply to them at the beginning of the let (all non-negotiable). I had no idea at the time who this company was and have now spent the last three months trying to 'wrestle' away from them (they are very difficult to get hold of, don't acknowledge complaints and easily confuse you etc). At no point did anyone inform me of gas/elec rates etc. I have just received a final bill in which the unit rates for gas seem well above average. I not only obliged to enter in this agreement with them from day 1 of letting (which seems wrong) but also have to pay excessive costs. This all seems wrong and seems to defeat (or even exploit) the principle of opening the utilities supply market up in the first place.
3141|These guys are without a doubt the single worst energy supplier i have come across!  They have refused permission to switch several times for 'outstanding balnce' namely GBP2.54 an absolute joke for customer services too . . . steer well clear PLEASE
3142|I was required to use the services of Spark Energy as a condition of a lease agreement. Despite paying this bill on a monthly basis, Spark sent a final bill some 14 months after the property was vacated which was based on an estimated opening reading. On querying this, I was informed it was a printing error and was quite correct. Given the obvious level of ineptitude which had surround the administration of my account, I requested written confirmation of this which was not forthcoming. Despite paying half the outstanding balance, answering all correspondence a timely manner and while in the hands of the Energy Ombudsman, the matter is being pursued by Spark Energys' debt collectors. This has been the most negative consumer energy experience I have the misfortune to encounter.
3143|Spark energy was foisted on me by the estate agent when i moved into my new rental property last year. I was told that spark was already in control of the energy supply to the property, so i allowed it to stay so, as i didn't want more hassle changing over energy providers. I visited the website and found some lovely-sounding tidbits, claiming that because they are a smaller company, they charge less and what not. So i gave them a chance.Now, last year, i wasn't exactly in the best of financial situations, so i was extremely careful with my electric and gas use. I used no where near as much as i would have used in my last property under a different energy provider (bear in mind, my monthly direct debit with spark was almost exactly the same amount as my previous provider). I put in my meter readings at the end of the month, and waited for my bill. Expecting it to be considerably low. When it came through, however, i am told i have, infact, went OVER and now owe them money! I switched providers immediately after this. Absolutely disgusting over-inflated prices. I wouldn't recommend anyone, who values their financial security, use Spark energy. You will be sorely dissapointed. 
3144|I was going to write down my poor experience with Spark Energy in full, but I don't think my story will sway what you already know. Look at that rating, look at the reviews, read a few if you will. Spark Energy are a horrendous company and the processes they have in place are slow, unreliable and will frustrate you beyond a measurable scale. They'll apologize till they're blue in the face but somehow nothing gets sorted and you find after numerous complaints and lengthy phone calls that still nothing is done.Avoid like the plague. Seriously, I'm not joking. If you've just opened a letter in a new property informing you you're with Spark Energy, find a new provider now, pick up the phone and move away from Spark as quickly as you can.
3145|On asking about an economy 7 meter we were told; you need to install it yourself, which I belive is illegal. Engineer failed to turn up twice when an appointment had finally been made. How these guys have a license to trade is beyond me? Their people are obviosuly not rained properly and their relationships with their sub-contractors is not existent.
3146|Having moved into rented accomodation in May 2010 we were immediately told that our Gas and Electric had been moved from southern Electric to Spark.  Having never rented before I thought this was done as the preference of the landlord so just allowed it to go ahead.  I contacted Spark and set up a direct debit for GBP70 a month to cover both gas and electric.This direct debit remained in place for 6months before i was notified that my direct debit had been increased to GBP144 a month by Spark.  No consultation occured regarding this and no explanation as to why they felt it should increase to this.  I allowed this direct debit to carry on thinking that I would rather over pay than under pay and get hit with a unexpected bill.This all carried on until December 2011 when I felt that it would sensible to see the current standing of my account as I had not received a single bill in all the time I had lived there.I contacted Spark gave them my readings and requested a bill, explaining that I had not received one in all the time I had lived there.  They insisted that a bill was sent to me every quarter, but they would email me an up to date bill staright away.They did this, and to my shock it showed that I hadn't been paying enough and owed them GBP800.  I double checked the meter readings on the bill against the ones that had been signed off on when moving into the property and found that there readings were so wrong, it was as if they had made them up.I contacted Spark with the details of the readings and they reissued me with an amended bill.  This showed that Spark owed me GBP600 where I had overpaid.  I was told that a refund would be issued after 28days for GBP500 and that GBP100 would be left as credit on the account.3 months later there was no sign of a refund so I contacted Spark again who told me that the amount owed was now nearer GBP700.  I explained that I had yet to receive a payment, to which they apologised and said they would make it a priority to get payment to me as soon as possible and in the meantime I would get an up to date bill emailed to me.1 month later, I still hadn't received payment or an up to date bill. I contacted Scottish power and instructed them that I wanted to transfer my gas and electric. And left them to it.I then receive a letter from Scottish power saying that Spark had blocked my transfer because of outstanding payments on the account.Another call to Spark, who looked into the issue and apologised, as it was them who owed me money, now showing as near GBP760.  Again I asked if i could have this refunded and was told it would take 28 days.My energy supplies have now moved to Scottish power and still no refund 1 month later.I have phoned Spark again explaining that my account has now moved and that I would like a final bill and a refund of the money I am owed.  They have told me that they can't give me a final bill yet and that it takes up to 21 days for the the readings to be sent to Spark to close the account fully.  It will then take a further 28 days for me to receive payment.I have since spoken to Scottish power who confirmed that Spark recieved the readings to close the account on the 11th and 14th May for Electric and Gas respectively.I have now been waiting since January for a refund of my money and still i'm being told I will have to wait.  As someone has previously said, they wouldn't have been very leniant if I owed them money, and they have still taken GBP144 out of my account by direct debit this week despite the account being closed.I see no other option other that to contact the ombudsmen and seek advice through them.  I will never use Spark again and will highly recommend to anyone to avoid them.
3147|"I was signed to Spark by ""Your Move"" Lettting agents without them informing me,(hidden in letting agreement) once I realised I contacted Spark and told them I wanted to change providers, they informed me that I couldn't ! Luckily I was only with them for three months but the bill for a studio flat in the summer was GBP250.00 and I was working during the day! Their unit price was over double that of Eon and it took Spark 10 months to calculate a bill even though they had readings, also their original bill was an estimate for over GBP 500. They should be avoided"
3148|Avoid this company  and be careful of letting agencies (Rightmove) in partnership with Spark who hide it in their contracts. We tried 3 times to switch supplier but Spark blocked it every time. The  only way to get rid of them was to move but then we could not get a final bill. After contacting the Omburdsman it finally arrived and we paid immediately. One year later and they are still contacting us for payment and although the acount is settled it is still not closed. Every time the chase us they realise the error and apologise but are too incompetent to sort their records out. Shocking that they are still in business.
3149|We moved into a student house that was supplied by Spark energy back in 2009, we were not supplied by them for very long. However, this hasn't stopped the problems still occurring. It first started after we closed the account with Spark and moved to British Gas.  At the time of cancellation, their billing system was down and therefore we kept receiving final bills of GBP900, GBP700, GBP600 etc. Debt collecting agencies also visited our student house, which was rather intimidating considering we were a house of 6 girls. When ringing them, they put a stop to the debt collectors hassling us and told us that the billing system was down and to ignore the bills until the problem was solved. We moved out of the house in June 2010, still without a final bill. I wanted to settle up before moving out, so I rung Spark again. The Operator I spoke to told me the billing system still wasnt working properly but estimated we owed about GBP181, of which I paid promptly to avoid any more grief from debt collectors claiming we owed money. I then gave a forwarding address for the final bill, if there was a further amount to pay and the woman I spoke to ensured me that if there was a further amount to pay that it wouldnt be much more. We therefore moved out thinking it had been sorted. In approximately November 2011, I received a phone call from a debt collecting agency regarding spark energy. This was a big shock considering it was almost a year and half since we moved out of the house. I rung Spark again to sort it out, explaining all of the above. I was told we owed a nominal amount, about GBP60 and a final bill will be sent to the forwarding address given.  However, I never received a further bill and I heard nothing more from them, so thought it had all been sorted out. This was until Friday 23rd of March, when the debt collecting agency rung again to claim we still owed money. I rang Spark promptly and asked what was going on? This time I was told we owed GBP298. This contradicted the earlier payment amount we were told. I have recently been told another amount this time GBP122.85. Also they now seem to have lost the payment I made back in June 2010 of GBP181, even though I am sure a lady from Spark actually told me the exact amount. It has taken them over 2 years to come to this final amount. I was told we used GBP544.60 worth of electricity and gas between the 1/7/09 to the 18/1/10. We were only on gas with Spark until the 28/10/09. Due to the fact we were students, we took the house on from the 1/7/09, but we wouldnt have been living there until 1st October 2009, when term would have started, so use would have been minimal. Again due to term dates we would have gone home again around the 16 December 2009 and come back around the middle of January 2010. Therefore we were only living there full time about 3 months while using electricity supplied Spark and hardly anytime at all using gas. I have been told we have paid a total GBP299.81, and on top of this we have paid GBP181 which they have lost. That is quite a lot of money for just 3 months use.I am still having phone calls and emails and we haven't been supplied by them since January 2010 or living in the house they supplied since June 2010. If anyone has any help they could offer it would be appreciated, I am really fed up, not even the complaint system seems to be putting a stop to this. 
3150|We moved in to a rented house in October and a few days later got a call from Spark to say they were supplying our gas and electricity. Set up a direct debit with them for GBP120. Thought it was a bit steep but they told me they price matched the big 6. In January I asked for a statement so I could compare if it woul be better to move. Found out they were only supplying my electricity not my gas. The gas hadnt been passed over from British gas due to money owed by previous occupier. No one had told me so all winter I had been running up a gas bill I hasn't been paying. So I asked for a refund in what I had overpaid. I requested this in February so I could pay British Gas, at the same time I requested British gas take over the Electricity from Spark. I was told it would take 28 working days for my refund (why??) but 28 days later it wasn't there. They also rejected British Gas request to supply our electricity. I've have contacted them so many times, by phone and email. By phone it takes about half an hour to get a response and by email it takes 5 days. I raised a complaint but still have not had my money back. They eventually let British gas take the supply so I'm glad I'm not being supplied by them. However it's been 12 weeks and I still don't have my money. If I owed them money for 12 weeks I bet it would be sold to a debt collector. This whole setup only works for Spark and the letting agencies (ours is Reeds Rains) as they get a commission for allowing Spark to supply their properties. I only gave one star as I couldn't give none. If I move again and it's supplied by Spark the first thing I will do is move supplier. 
3151|we moved into a rented property 5 months ago and have been tryig to get rid of this company since. they are just rip off merchants. GBP310 bill for 2 months gas and electric for a 2 person family who both work full time! and we haven't even had the heating on since the first bill due to being so scared of getting a bigger bill! as far as we are concerned we moved to british gas last month but have just recieved another bill for this same period. we rang them after our first bill and said we wanted to move but it has taken so long. apparenty they pay agents to be installed as a recommended provider so they can overcharge people knowing it will take ages to change or people won't bother if they are on a short lease. companies like this make me sick and i will be complaining to anyone that will listen!
3152|I didn't even realise I had joined this company until I received a bill from them when I moved to a new house. When I spoke to a company representative and asked how they had got my agreement to join them she quickly told me the agreement was in my tenancy agreement. I can only assume that this question is asked a lot bearing in mind the speed of her reply. I then tried to leave and they blocked my move until I paid the 22 pounds for the whole 4 days I had been with them. It took me two months of misery trying to get away from these con merchants and over 200 spent. When I questioned one of there meter readings which was wholly inaccurate they sent me to a debt collection agency and charged me 20 for the privelige. I don't suppose I'll ever seen that and luckily my new supplier allowed me to give them an inaccurate reading to match the made up one that Spark had given me. This company is devious, expensive and quite frankly provided me with the most appalling service I have ever had. I cannot believe in a regulated market a corrupt company like this is allowed to trade. I urge you check your tenancy agreements and if a contract to join this company is within it then cross it out. The only way to stop this kind of robbery is to put these thieves out of business. 
3153|There is not one single positive comment I could think of when trying to write this review. Somehow the company had managed to become our energy supplier when we moved in through 'your move', even my landlord had no idea about it nor had he ever heard of this company before.Constant texts/calls/emails/letters if you haven't paid your bill within 7 days, even if you have paid it sometimes the payment gets 'lost' and after being on the phone for over an hour the person will say oh yes we've managed to locate your payment.Had someone visit to read the meter and got lumped with a bill of GBP325, ok I understand the monthly estimates may not have been high enough and this payment was needed however,t even after we paid it we were still getting calls/texts and letters about it to the point where I had to 'change' my telephone number!Have now just had a bill through for GBP45 for a 'pdv' visit which we have no idea what it means? From doing some research it looks like it is a visit that spark provide when you haven't paid your bill, funnily enough one of the 'lost' payments.I naively believed that staying with them was easier than changing but the hassle/stress they caused looking back is not worth it.Please if you are with Spark trust me when I say...get out while you can!!
3154|Cant contact, waiting 30 mins , 2 days in a run, dont bother with this company the spark has definatley run out
3155|Easily the worst company I have ever dealt with in my 41 years !!!Sold my house and renting on temporary basis until we buy again-scammed by Yourmove estate agents and Spark.Made high level complaint with Yourmove as impossible to get through to Spark who provided garbage service in the 2-3 months I was trying to escape.Now back with British Gas.Received my final bill for GBP18 which also kindly states that if not paid within 7 days they will set the debt collectors on me.Simply a vile and nasty little cowboy company
3156|Can we even call these a company!?Spark energy are a disgrace. SCAMMERS
3157|I recently moved house, my lettings agents were Your Move.Unfortunately due to time constraints at their office, I missed the clause stating we would be supplied by Spark Energy and our contact details would be passed to them.By the way this clause is not legally binding as it is unfair.  Our landlord was not aware of this clause either and has complained to Your Move.Having worked for one of the 'Big Six' in residential customer services I immediately called Spark to cancel the account as all energy providers have a cooling off period to cancel, should you change your mind.  I was told this was not possible due to the clause in my tenancy agreement.Well I have now been waiting for nearly 3 months to leave and have not yet been successful.Trying to charge customers GBP150 in advance for not choosing to pay by direct debit is not in line with the 'Big Six' and I have never come across an energy provider who charges GBP10 late payment fees for not paying within 7 days.This company is trying to compete with professional organizations and are doing a very bad job.  Also they are paying lettings agents such as Your Move commission for forcing tenants to be supplied by them.If this is the only way they can win business then they have a very poor and underhanded business plan.  I just hope that the OFT and Ofgem wise up to their despicable practices. I am in the process of complaining as we never received any terms and conditions or details of their cooling off period and cancellation process. If this has happened to you speak to the OFT and loge a complaint regarding their customer service.From reading all the posts here it seems Hailey is the one person tasked with dealing with all complaints made on this site.Avoid Your Move also, as we received equally bad customer service.
3158|We moved into a rented property and where stuck with them.We moved in and the previous tenant had a debt, despite repeated requests to have this debt removed we are still paying for it.....obviously the company is happy to have us pay this on top of their extortionate rates.Just appalling customer service, they cannot care less and are just plain dreadful. One example is a request for a new gas card which was not going to arrive over the bank holiday and knowing we would run out of gas they said they would get someone out that day (within 4 hours) to put credit on the meter.....they never did it until the following day after we chased it!!!They owe us money and wow, its fun getting it back off them!!GONE TO THE REGULATOR ABUT THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     SHAME I CANNOT GIVE A MINUS RATING
3159|Hi, Well just like anyone else in rented accommodation who is not allowed to move supplier due to their tenancy agreement, I was stuck with no choice being with Spark Energy.I thought id give it a go, and just like my old supplier, I wanted to pay the bill as it came in. Not long after I moved in, I kept getting letters saying that if I do not pay them by Direct debit, they want an upfront fee of GBP150. Unfortunately I don't have that kind of money lying about, when I have already paid lots of fees to move. After several threating letters, I decided the only option was to pay by direct debit.All was ok, up until my tenancy ended and I had to move out of the property. I gave my final readings expecting to pay a final bill. After 1 month I still had not received a final bill so I chased them.I was advised of the final amount over the phone, but I opted to pay from my direct debit the final amount.When I eventualy got the final bill, I saw an end balance less than GBP20, I assumed this would come directly out of my bank account. When I next checked my bank account, Spark Energy decided that they would take yet another monthly payment from my bank account rather than the final  bill.I have been trying to deal with their complaints team since the 30th March, but again they are just as good as their normal customer service. They have yet sent any refund and keep asking the same questions.They are quick enough to chase me for money if I owed it to them, but they seem to take their time when its my money that they have.My advise - stay away from them!
3160|"Like many others, I have been struggling with this company over the last year and I'm about to file a complaint with the energy ombudsman. Spark is an odd company, nobody would choose to use them and they are forced onto you by letting agents (Yourmove in my case). When I first moved into my flat, I received a voicemail from Spark and thought it sounded very suspicious. I quickly searched for information on them and found a page listing them as a scam. At that point, I just ignored them and carried on paying npower as they were the current supplier. I finally got a call from them a few weeks later and was informed that my balance had been passed on to a debt collection agency... As you would imagine, I was quite surprised.I called the Letting agents and was told they were in fact taking over our energy as was stated in my agreement.Lovely! So I found this site and realised the world of pain I was about to be sucked into. Over the last year, they have charged me extortionate bills that are completely random and slapped charge after charge on without any validity. Like others have mentioned, talking to their support staff is a waste of time. I called them numerous times with actual readings and they told me to stop paying until they had been recorded. It took them months to sort the readings and in that time I received multiple ""PDV"" and late payment charges. I finally got through to someone who was willing to help and he put the reading through and cancelled all the charges. Great news you would think... the account was now in credit and all charges were gone. That was right near the end of my tenancy agreement and I moved out shortly after. I received a final bill from spark yesterday and my heart sank when I saw the amount. They had added all the charges back on. I was told that they will give me a 25% discount as a gesture of good will if I pay in the next few days. If I don't, it goes over to debt collection. I'm honestly insulted at the lies, terrible standards and bad practice or Spark.I really wish there was something I could do to have this company investigated. There are going to be thousands more sucked in without even knowing until it's too late.Whoever the owner/owners of Spark are, you should be truly ashamed. Your business is a worthless, desperate failure."
3161|Similar problems to many others where I was signed up for their supply in a rental property. When I tried to switch providers they would not release my supply. Eventually after threat of legal action I have now resolved all of the issues and am making a formal complaint to the Energy Ombudsman.Incidentally they claim to be no more than 5% more expensive than other suppliers, this is not the case in my experience.Please avoid.
3162|"The list of complaints goes on for so long I do not even no where to start !! To sum it up, i managed to get an incorrect bill of GBP625 down to GBP92. Spark charges GBP45 for ""PDV"" visits. This is where someone calls around to discuss an outstanding balance. Only, nobody called around, and nor could spark provide evidence that they had !  Instead they put on this charge freely and hope you do not query it. They also charged me GBP325 for a warrant of entry which was completely un justified. I paid the agreed amount on the agreed day, and they still put the charge on as they claimed they still had to pay the lock smith in advance. I called a million times, with the promise someone will call back , they never do. My bill also consist of extra costs that I have absolutely no idea what they are for. After six weeks of letters and calls, I have finally reduced my bill to GBP92. This however, is still not correct and I'm left wondering whether I should just clear the bill so I can finally move on and ditch this company (they have declined my previous requests as the longer they keep you hanging, the more your bills are racking up. I urge any one with this company so check your bills sooo throughly...I can Pretty much quarantee they will be plenty of ""mistakes"" "
3163|After moving into a rental property in May 2011 our lettings agents advised us to join sparks energy which we did. They sent bills for the gas which seemed rather high but are paid every month, the bills are usually under estimated so i always pay more than asked but the problem has been with the electricity. Still no bill, countless phonecalls for which i haved  spent a fortune on a pay as you go mobile. Letters have been sent. Firstly i was told they couldn't get the mplan number so i had to deal with that myself, then they said they didn't have the serial number of the meter which i have already given them. Now they say the serial number does not appear on the electricty database and as their database picks up from the other it's as if the meter does not exist so they will contact the other people to get it added on and then they can bill me? All this and eleven months later, it has cost me a fortune in calls, i will now end up with a bill i cannot pay and all due to these people not doing their job properly as they are supposed to record details of each mail and each telephone conversation and they even sent a meter reader out but have no record of this, what a mess, a very unhappy, stressed customer
3164|"Got hooked with this company by fault of our letting agency, despite already arranging energy suppliers. Would vote 0 stars if possible.Very slippery company complete with awful customer service, and they only care about money. They promise to reply to emails within 5 days but I've been waiting the best part of a month, only to receive a reply today saying little more than ""give us your money"", despite sending them a VERY long list of complaints.This company has absolutely no good side, and if your letting agency sticks you with them, get the hell out as soon as possible! "
3165|We moved into a rental property and unbeknowst to us, we agreed (somewhere in the fine print), to transfer to SPARK energy company.  We received a welcome letter from them and immediately went about transferring to a new supplier.  Three and half months later still trying to transfer.Huge headache contacting them, wanted us to pay GBP150 up front, objected to our transfer to another company twice.
3166|I was in a rental property between dec 10 and april 11 where i was with spark fot 2 months and then changed, I paid all my bills on time and correctly. I have now in 2012 had a letter come through from a debt collection agency demanding money. How dare Spark now demand money. Absolutly rubbish company AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE !!!!!!
3167|Terrible customer service. Terrible prices. And when you try to leave they mess it up so you're stuck with them for a month. Avoid like the plague.
3168|never ever go with spark even if u have no other option.
3169|This company is the worst company and has caused me so much stress, I don't know if anyone can help me but I set up a direct debit with them last year and there taking amounts of money I haven't agreed to, 500 pounds this month 1000 pound another month 200 pounds and they don't stick to the agreed amount. There abusing the trust and I'm sure its illegal???They messed mt credit rating up as there taking money when its not in there and taking me in the minus and now me and my husband are unable to get a mortgage its seriously crazy!!I'm cancelling my direct debit and finding a new supplier but they need to be closes down for good so they can't put anyone else through thiss stress
3170|"Spark Energy are an utter disgrace... I am a relatively calm person, but this company wound me up to the extreme. Below is the email I sent to them... I have a case number with the Ombudsman, but my complaint hasnt been resolved yet as I have to use Sparks Complaints procedure.I didnt mention in the below email that they also decided to take GBP200 rather than GBP100 out of my account in August by direct debit!! Leaving me up you know what creek, without a paddle - AGAIN. Please please please avoid this company, Ombudsman/Consumer Direct need to shut them down.Good Afternoon Spark Energy!! You have sent a debt collection agency after me?! How dare you! I will now waste my time and explain all of my dealings with you, so that you can resolute this ASAP. (A copy of this letter is being sent to the Ombudsman as I already have a long standing complaint with you) Back in June, me and my mother moved into a new rental property and started with Spark energy for our Electricity Supply. You took my account details from me and said that you would contact me to advise me of my direct debit details and when payments would come out etc. On June 28th you took GBP175 from me without warning me, writing to me; nothing. I phoned you in tears asking why this was done, for the advisor to say that ""he didn't know"" and that I should ring my bank to have my payment ""ademnified"" and that proper direct debit payment details would follow. As a result of this random payment deduction I suffered a number of charges on my account totalling GBP30. I have a string of email correspondence with ""Paul"" supposedly a manger who said that he would distribute a GBP30 compensation payment into my account to cover this. So far this has not happened. To be honest I could not bare to waste my time chasing this up and just hoped that this payment would eventually reach my account. Of course it has not.  So I continue making payments to Spark Energy on a monthly basis. Each time I phone Spark Energy they tell me I am fully paid up to date. Speaking to an advisor shortly before I left the property we worked out that it seemed as though I owed around GBP44.24. In December I leave the property and am told I will be sent my final bill to my new property. In January I am horribly surprised to find a final bill sent to me (to my new property) of GBP237.21. I immediately phone Spark and ask them to explain this final bill and where GBP237.21 has come from. The advisor (unfortunately I didn't take his name) tells me that the payment is overdue from June?! and that he will send my details through to billing/missing payments department to look into my account and send a revised bill. Just to point out - if this really has been owed since June, why didn't anyone tell me during our numerous telephone conversations, and why leave it until December to send me this bill when frankly I do not have a spare GBP237.21 lying around! To date, a ""revised bill"" has never arrived. Yesterday my mother received a telephone call from a Debt Collection Agency telling her that she must pay the bill immediately or be taken to court. How dare you ring my 50 year old mother and threaten to take her to court?!! The ""Debt Collector"" advises my mother that themselves and Spark Energy had to ""track down our address and number"". This is utterly ridiculous considering that I have documentation from Spark Energy sent directly to my new property in January?!!! Also after looking at my bills I can see that when we started with Spark Energy in June we were charged 9.6p per kilowatt. This then rose to 17.3p per kw and then finally 25.9p per kw?!?!! No doubt you have some clause stating that you can do this, but taking my payment rate from 9.6p to 25p per kw over a 6 month period without so much as a letter letting me know, surely can NOT be acceptable?? I tried to phone your offices today but no one is available. I seriously hope that someone contacts me either via email or phone on 0754******* to resolve this. If I genuinely owe any money, I want an exact breakdown showing how you have worked this out, as well as a plan detailing payment installments, as I can not afford to pay you any more that GBP50 a month (on top of my own monthly energy bills)! I am disgusted to pay you anything if I have to, but trust that my GBP30 compensation will be knocked off any ""Final Bill"". I have emails documenting my conversations with Paul, and will forward those to you when I go to work on Monday. I will likely be phoning after work on Monday to repeat this to you, however if I haven't heard from you in response to this email by Friday I am going to contact the Ombudsman again. I am a 22 year old girl, I do not deserve to have a debt collection agency threatening me OR my mother! Molly Hurford-Anderson"
3171|Having dealt with a series of utilities providers over the years I can safely say that Saprk is by far the worst I have ever had the misfortune of engagaing with. EVERY bill is wrong, meter readings don't get logged, bills come out late and they are always incorrect. Any customer care conversations don't get acknowledged and then they engage Churchill debt collectors before the bill is due to be paid! This business should be shut down or at least they need to be regulated more effectively. 
3172|Well...where to begin?Firstly I would like to make a point to the person who keeps commenting on Spark Energy's behalf on people's reviews saying to contact them directly and that they are 'sorry you were not happy with the level of service you received'.......This is a joke right? I have spent over 15 hours on the phone with people at Spark Energy.......Spark Energy constantly mess you around, lie about how they obtain and estimate their readings, change the dates of which they are claiming you owe them money for and change the amount they claim you owe! They threaten 'Legal Action' if you do not accept their ridiculous demands....my own is for a total of GBP426 for a 5 week supply!! I pay British Gas GBP60 per month for my supply...and last month I received money back from them because I was in CREDIT!!!!!! Spark seem to think I owe them GBP426 for 5 weeks....are you kidding me? Spark Energy's 'customer service' agents are rude, inept and down right unhelpful....there is NEVER a supervisor on hand to speak to you when you ask as they have always 'just gone into a meeting' - I have been told on numerous occassions that a supervisor will call me back...they never do! All I ever receive are ridiculous text messages saying that my 'debt' is being passed onto a collections agency unless I pay the full amount!! IEVERY review of your service says the same! I was ended having you people take control of my Energy account by a hidden clause in my tenancy agreement with the letting agents 'Your Move' - who as far as letting agents go are also just about the worst I have ever come across! I wanted nothing to do with your company and regret the day I ever allowed Your Move to con me into entering any such agreement with yourselves!! To anybody reading this please take my advice :DO NOT SIGN ANY TENANCY AGREEMENT THAT MAKES YOU ENTER INTO USING SPARK ENERGY!!! IF YOU HAVE HAD ANY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE PLEASE CONTACT THE ENERGY OMBUDSMAM AT http://www.ombudsman-services.org/energy.htmlI have instructed a solicitor to look into this matter for me as I am led to believe that it is not even legal for a letting agent to pass on your details and enter you into a signed agreement with a 3rd party company...if you did not sign an agreement with Spark Energy then the responsibility lies with the company that did...in my case Your Move! Please take my warning seriously folks....I am also about to take my case to the national newspapers to expose this company.
3173|"I received a joke of a bill for approximately one month's supply of electricity (which is all I have in my currently rented property) for over GBP200. I immediately took issue with this bill, but they weren't interested and just wanted paying. So I didn't pay. In comes Buchanan Clark and Wells, another bunch of chumps, chasing me up with threatening letters in order to try and get me to pay the full sum of the (entirely incorrect) bill. I get in touch with Spark having sent an e-mail to BCW to tell them in no uncertain terms that I won't be dealing with them, having read numerous unpleasant stories about those idiots. I arrange to pay a small sum of money per month, which was agreed with by Spark. The next payment after the first was made, I had reason to phone Spark and say the payment would be late, and then FINALLY someone from Spark Energy said ""something isn't right here"" (to which if you could fit the alternative word for excrement and Sherlock into the same sentence you'd have my thoughts on that comment), so I'm told Spark will talk to my current suppliers (I immediately switched over to SSE as soon as I found out how bad Spark were- Nay, ARE), and was told that it would take four weeks for anything to come back as a result of their communications with each other. This is fine I thought. Four weeks pass, I don't hear a thing. I wonder if it's been cancelled (no chance) or if they've forgotten. It's their money they want it, they can get in touch with me. This was last year in November. The dispute having been long-standing since April of last year. THIS MONTH I receive yet another threatening letter (last week) from BCW. I send an e-mail saying ""oi what's all this about then?"", to which I get a pretty naff apology for the letter, which I'm told I received because no record was made on any change to the circumstances surrounding my bill.To add insult to injury, they want me to supply two readings a week apart, this month. The bill I received last year, mind you, was for the period March to April. Which was considerably bloody warmer than February. Jokers.So they're not getting those readings this month that's for damn sure.On the same day I get the e-mail apologizing for the letter I receive from BCW (which in my opinion does certainly not stand for Buchanan Clark and Wells but some considerably unpleasant alternatives not to be repeated in front of children or easily offended adults), I get yet ANOTHER letter from them, not threatening court action like the one last week did, but being so rude as to say they're willing to accept GBP180 out of some kind of good gesture (FAIL). They won't be getting it. I am now in the throes of lodging a formal complaint with them, and also I am going to sue for stress caused thanks to the letters I have been getting unceasingly from BCW. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS. And if you should rent a property, make sure the estate agents are well informed that if they do arrange suppliers you request it NOT to be Spark Energy."
3174|We took over a previously rented property early last year as owner-occupiers. We assumed that it would be straightforward to switch from Spark to our usual electricity supplier. Whilst the switching of supplier was eventually resolved, we learned that a previous tenant defaulted on settling their account to the tune of a couple of hundred pounds, and hard as we tried, through phone calls, a detailed letter and going through the proper complaints procedure, it proved impossible to convince Spark of our innocence. It was never possible to speak to someone in authority and our correspondence was ignored.After almost a year, during which time we could only presume the matter had been sorted out, because we have never received as much as an acknowledgement of our communications, let alone an apology, today we received a new solicitor's letter, threatening us with legal action if we did not pay for the period involved - which began two and a half months before we moved into this address.We have spent a good part of today faxing the information which Spark received months ago, to their solicitors.  I cannot, in all honesty, find a single thing to recomment Spark to anyone - it pains me to award the one star necessary to submit this review.
3175|I too am having problems with Spark Energy. They took over my supply without my knowledge, they issued a bill with a 
3176|I switched my supplier from Spark back in May. It then transpired that Spark owe me about GBP360 in credit due to overcharges. Here we are now in sight of Christmas and the new year and I have not received a penny of repayment. This is despite numerous telephone calls to customer services, numerous emails, and having jumped through the hoop of a drawn out formal complaint procedure. This last putatively resolved matters when I received a letter promising all money owed would be paid into my account within 28 working days. But no payment was made. Since then I have called this company twice asking to speak either with a senior member of staff or a person in the finance department who might be able to sort matters out. I have not been able to get passed customer services and been told each time someone would be in touch. No one ever gets back to me. As I see it Spark Energy is holding onto this money against their bottom line and for the interest accruing upon it. I have no alternative but to go to OFGEM to retrieve this money I am rightfully and legally entitled to. From reading so many similar complaints to my own in this and other online forums it is clear Spark Energy has an unwritten policy of holding onto customers' cash for as long as possible. I call this company and its practice despicably cynical.
3177|I have been in dispute with this joke of a company for almost 2 years and have finally received a ruling in my favour by the Energy Ombudsman.Folllowing my request to transfer to another supplier due to the non provision of regular statements, I have endured: incorrect final bills, estimated final bills, no call centre response, no call backs as promised, Debt collection agency letters however the final offer of a 10% discount on a bill that I do not owe as a gesture of goodwill was the final straw.I raised this issue with the Energy Ombudsman who found in my favour indicating that Spark Energy failed in all aspects of my case stating that the company fell well below the standards expected.Following the Ombudsmans ruling Spark Energy were made to forward a letter of apology, cancel any outstanding bill and forward a GBP50 goodwill payment.I write this to raise awareness that there is hope out there and that the Energy Ombudsman Service was extremely helpful. 
3178|Moved into a new rentale tried to transfer my account from my old supplier, but was immediately blocked by spark energy, been trying to change supplier for 2 months now, they are arrogant and rude on the phone and never want to help, was told, read your contract.
3179|I received a bill for an outstanding amount of GBP189.99, I paid this on 1st November. Since then I have had countless text messages, letters and voicemail asking for payment. I called them on the 14th to say I had paid gave them all the details and when I paid it, they said they would correct this and stop the annoying correspondence. He said that it had been added to this months bill, so on the 14th I paid again t bring everything up to date. I then continue to get spammed about payment, cue seconfd call 22nd Nov. They said they would clear it up and send to finance dept. and could i send proof of payment. I have sent them my account statement clearly showing payment, one day goes by and guess what another text message warning me about over due payment. What a joke this company is, stay clear.I will be calling them once more, I have kept all correspondence, taken names and recorded all conversations, so much more and I will be sending these to my solicitor and the financial ombudsman. Had just about enough now!! Terrible company. 
3180|I also had Spark forced upon me through the letting agents and immediately tried to change supplier. This they blocked apparently because bills hasd not been settled. As you will read else where they seem incapable of sending bills properly addressed or computed.This appears to be a very cynical operation and it is about time it was exposed.
3181|Like many others have had nothing but poor experience with Spark.  They were automatically put in place by the letting agents.  Immediately the first bills were very high - between two and three times out actual usage.  I contacted them to say that their estimates were miles off the mark, and they replied that that was the average usage for a house of the size (GBP150/month for a 3 bed terrace).  They promised that after 3 months they'd adjust since they had readings, this was not the case and it took 2 further sets of emails over 6 months to finally get a reduced bill (no refund on the GBP100s we had built up in credit though).I have now moved and am having to chase spark energy repeatedly to get them to close my account, so far nothing but unmet promises and automated emails.To top it all off I don't actually know whether they owe me money, or I owe them money, since they haven't sent a bill for over a year.  Additionally meters were not read in two years (I thought 18 months was a statutory requirement).  I presume the only reason Spark Energy are still in business is because they give kick-backs to the estate agents who force them upon their tenants.
3182|Took me about 8 months to get away from these people. They use all manner of underhand tactics to make it painful to leave. Their complaints process is a farce, they simply ignore you until you go away!!! They make changes to your meter reading entries, completely fabricating the numbers and charging ridiculous amounts for their service. Terrible customer service and attitude on the phone, they never call back when they promise. I chased and chased and chased to get things sorted with them. AVOID AVOID AVOID like the plague is my advice!!!!!
3183|Under no circumstances would I reccommend this company to anyone, I had the unfortunate experience of 2 different landlords having signed me up to this company and I hope now to be finally rid of them, my first landlord switched us after being informed that they where apparently very good for multiple occupancy housing, after a mere few months experience with them I wished I had made more of a fuss at this point, when I moved into another house and found out that was also spark my heart sank, their customer service department is a pain in the backside to deal with, their bills are unjustifiably through the roof and frankly you are lucky if they even acknowledge you having paid the bill, they have sent debt collection letters before bills in the past and have also sent them long after we had paid, truely a living hell
3184|I moved into a student property in July 2010 and had to use Spark as that was the Landlords choice. I set up a direct debit, and regularly submitted meter readings, and in June 2011 when I closed the acccount was advised that I was in credit of about GBP60 so they cancelled the direct debit and told me not to pay the last months bill.   When I recieved my final bill a month later it stated that I owed GBP176. After many phone calls (I did manage to get through after a very long wait) I finally found out that Spark had had the type of gas meter recorded incorrectly and therefore had been undercharging me all year (although I was giving correct meter readings) I then followed their complaints procedure where I queried their customer care as no one had even sent me a letter informing me of the recharge amount.  They replied stating that my final bill was correct but failed to answer my complaint at all.During this complaints procedure which I followed meticulously I received numinous calls, text messages and letter harassing for payment despite the account being on hold awaiting resolution.  I was further appalled when after 3 and a half days of receiving a response from Spark I started to receive hassle from a debt collection agency (even though it took them just under a month to respond to me through their complaints procedure) Even now my complaint has not been answered. Spark Energy employ absolutely no care for their customers and I wonder how they survive as a company. Avoid them at all costs. Next stop for me is the Ombudsman.       
3185|My partner and I rented a property 18 months ago & for each & ever month we paid our energy bill to these idiots by direct debit.  After leaving the property they sent me a final bill, which consisted of an incorrect meter number & incorrect readings the bill was for nearly GBP600.  I imediatly called them & queried this, to which they openly admitted they were wrong & would send us a corrected bill - which they did, they in fact owed us GBP35 for overpayments.  However 18 months later this pathetic excuse of a company have sent us another bill... for the exact amount as the initial incorrect final bill.  Countless emails later with them asking the most ridiculous of questions they still have not sorted it out, but knowing that it is an ongoing dispute they have still been persisting to call, text and email my partner.  They have actually had the audacity to say that they are not sure whether we have paid everything... out bank statements tell a different story. The big question is, how the hell do these bunch of monkeys continue to be in business.  I think that maybe the governing body of energy providers needs to have a good look into this company... I have not seen one positive review,  I would be ashamed to work for such a shabby organisation!
3186|I have recently given a new meter reading to this company, to find out I was owed GBP450 approx in over charges made by this companies estimates. I specifically requested having this money repayed, as to have this amount on credit is ridiculous! They agreed, nearly 4 months later, still no repayment. I have rung twice again, and sent three emails, and not recieved as much as a call back. Can someone tell me if I can sue the company for this, as it is my money that they are refusing to give back. The customer serivce number is a load of **** too, as I have literally just spent 50 minutes on hold, trying every differnt combination of customer service numbers!A joke!
3187|Just dont even bother with them. It took us 2 attempts to pay them (after being complained to that we were not paying our bills), terrible service during the year and customer service with bad attitude. Took 2 attempts to get a final bill and pay it. Then a year after we move out, they try to charge us again!Incompetent fools.
3188|I was living with a friend for 15 month in a 2 bedroom flat every month we got our bill + - GBP45 we both did work a lot and we hardly ever were home.before i moved out i contacted them to tell them that i move out 2 weeks later i got my final bill GBP1070!!!!!! I thought it must have been a mistake so i called them and the told me that the the undercharged us and we own them the money! I payed my bill every month never anybody came to check the meter reading! My friend moved away and she is not having a job atm so no money! HOW on earth can i pay this bill? We can set up a payment plan the told me! WTF after reading all this review i dont know what to think! can anybody help me? Anybody been in the same situation? 
3189|This is a joke! Since I had a Spark as supllier was a nightmare to contact them for any anything. Each time there was a problem with bill there was no person available who knew what is going on.Also they have been missing so many payments. The bills were sent not monthly. They have been sending them when somebody propably seen outstanding payments on their system. I could not finish a contract with them due to their mess in system!!!Still waiting for final bill even though I have got new supllier for nearly 6 months.Never again!!!
3190|I had trouble with this company from day one. They failed to input my correct details and meter readings and followed that up with ridiculous bills and even though I rang on several occasions they still failed to correct the situations. Finally they threatened me with legal action.I made various payments to prove that I was not trying to evade payment. After 6 months I vacated the property and at that stage, as they admitted, I had been charged and paid double the amount due. I have now been trying to obtain the repayment from them for two months unsuccessfully. This company is the worse company I have ever dealt with. Don't don't don't ever consider using this supplier.
3191|Too much to write, so here's the email I sent to spark. AVOID IF YOU CAN. I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received from Spark energy during my tenancy at the property 14, Algiers St, BS3 4LP, particularly the way my account has been handled since I moved out of the property In May of this year. I called 0845 034 74 74 a day or so after moving out of the property to supply my final reading and request a settlement bill. I was put through to an overflow call centre which sounded like it was in the US. I gave them the reading and was told that my final bill would be with me in 4 to 6 weeks. I received nothing.I called again to chase this. I left my details for somebody to call me back on the automated service, which nobody did.I called once again a couple of days later (by this time, it was July) and once again I was put through to an overflow call centre, only this time I was told that they could not deal with my request so somebody would call me back. I received a phone call from a team member at Spark, which to be fair I missed, however the voicemail told me that I had missed the return call so should call back again.Eventually (over 8 weeks later) I received an annual statement from Spark, which showed my account as being active and with an overdue balance of over GBP300. It made no mention to my original call to disconnect, nor did it take into account my final meter reading. This including June's usage which was obviously incorrect as I had not been living in the property for a month at that point. On top of this, It did not reference any of my previous monthly meter readings, so as far as I am aware the whole year has been an estimate.Eventually, I managed to get through to somebody who sounded as if they worked for Spark's call centre, he was polite and helpful and seemed to understand my situation, I explained that I no longer have my final meter reading because a; It's two months since I moved and b; I already supplied the meter reading once back in May. He told me this would be ok, that he could find the meter reading I gave initially and that I should wait for my final bill, which would end in May and would show a revised figure left to pay.Problem solved? Until I received the below email.It is also worth mentioning that I have tried calling at various times during my tenancy at various hours of the day, not just at busy periods. I also submitted meter readings on your website, after which I received no correspondence or confirmation that the submission was successful.I refuse to pay any settlement bill based on an estimated reading. It is not my problem that you have lost my final meter reading, neither is it my problem that Spark are not prepared to employ enough full time staff to manage the phones at busy periods. I look forward to hearing from you,
3192|Avoid this company at all costs. I have been waiting for a refund of over GBP200 since October 2010. I have made endless phone calls to a service centre - the best they can offer is 
3193|Upon moving into a rented premises we were informed that our supplier was Spark Energy. Having soon realised that a competitor - Scottish Power - offered more reasonable per unit prices were sought a switch; which, is supposedly a hassle-free, smooth transition. In this case, however, it dragged on for three months, as Spark Energy refused to grant permission for a transfer - placing a block on our account and suggesting, through indirect correspondence (e-mail), that we owed an outstanding bill (wholly inaccurate).I attempted to have this lifted through roughly a dozen phone calls - mainly to inept, overtly regressive call handlers, until I threatened to record the call and refer it to their supervisor. This, thankfully, saw us given the direct e-mail address to the company - something i'm willing to share on request - and, albeit arduously, we were able to have the block lifted. I'm writing now, almost nine months on, and it appears that I am still unable to rid myself of this nightmare company. Now in a new property, and happily with Scottish Power, I received an e-mail from Spark two days ago requesting an outstanding bill (paid in September 2010) of GBP170 for the accrued usage of g&e; from two weeks in August 2010! Ridiculous. They're threatening me with court and bailiff action, but quite frankly, i'm ready to argue my case.Avoid at all costs. 
3194|I gave up trying to get bills and switched to Scottish Power. A month after the switch I got a letter dated May 3rd demanding payment for the prior six months by April 29th. It's now 15 months later and I've received two emails and a phone call telling me my final payment is overdue!It's a mystery to me how they manage to stay in business.
3195|Having worked for Scottish Gas several years ago I find it hard to believe Spark have a licence to run this energy company-  In 6 months they have failed to bill me despite my provision of multiple up-date-meter reads... every member of staff I speak to apologises, blames someone else and says they will fix the problem but nothing happens. They send me requests for my direct debit details- without a bill? I don't think so!! Several weeks pass and I end up calling again, being put hold or disconnected- that is when I can get thru at all as the line is always busy.  The amount of my time that has been wasted on Spark is a disgrace.  In short, these guys are incompetent and useles cowboys- DO NOT USE SPARK ENERGY- you will regret it.
3196|"I am finding myself having to the utmost of my ability not resort to hyperbole. The service I have received from Spark Energy has been poor on so many levels.1 - Bills. Initially, my bills came through at a reasonable price. However, after having found out that Spark Energy opened up multiple accounts for me, I started getting bills for about three times the amount I should be paying. All they could say in response was, meter readings are alright. It's only until recently, when TRYING, to leave the company that I had been informed that they input my Rate 1 as Rate 2 and reverse, leading to a massive increase in price. However, I'm not even sure this has been resolved now as I'm trying to leave the company but they keep not registering any of the meter readings I provide them with. More on that later.2 - Customer Service. By far the worst experience I have. When I call to inquire about why my bills are so high, I get the response that they are according to the meter readings I have supplied and that I am ""unwilling to supply them with a meter reading"". The customer services is rude, blocks me from speaking to a manager and does not record vital information resulting in several duplicate letters. The company is basically strong-arming me into staying with them and not letting me transfer to a new energy company.3 - Complaints procedure. I made a complaints seven weeks ago, I have not heard a word from them since. I have been told on numerous occassions that they will be contacting me, but nothing has happened.4 - Recordings. The company does not record all information you give them. I sent several e-mails to the customer service which no one replied to. Following a phone call, I was informed that there were no e-mails despite me receiving confirmations of the e-mails having been sent and confirming with a customer service advisor online that the e-mails I then forwarded were being received.In shot, I am trying to leave the company, but they are not letting me leave. As a result, despite not having the time to do this, I am forced to contact the ombudsman. Whatever you do. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH SPARK ENERGY! I am not even joking, this has been a horrendous experience which just keeps going. I wish I could name one positive thing about the company, but there is nothing I can say in their defense.I would urge every single person who's had problems with them to send in a complaint, wait for them not to respond and then collectively contact the energy ombudsman. This is the only way that I can see where the company can actually be sent a message. Don't leave it, make complaints and make a fuss.However, if you can, just avoid them completely. Trust me, you do not want the hassle!"
3197|"The bills we were sent were made by a random number generator. Bills were based on meter readings we had not supplied, in addition we received two completely different (GBP50 different) bills for the same time period.We've only been with them 3 months and we have received 4 wrong bills.When we complained all they could say was ""we can confirm that the details we have provided are correct"" in spite of the fact they were quoting amounts we hadn't paid.We are leaving as soon as we can.DON'T GO WITH SPARK ENERGY"
3198|"-------AVOID SPARK AT ALL COSTS!!-------  When I moved into a new rental accomodation in July 2009, I recieved letters from Spark energy telling me my lettings agent had decided Spark will supply the property from now on, thus were requesting details (didn't find out until later that lettings agents aren't allowed to choose energy suppliers for you, but as it was my first rental I went along with it). And so all seemed to go ok for the first 3 or 4 months. Then we didn't recieve a bill at all for October, and the following months bills arrived late. Then over the winter we didn't get any bills at all, just a letter telling us they were ""upgrading"" their billing system and we should expect one in Feburary. Eventually (March) we received Feburary's bill, charging us all the way back to the day we moved in back in July. Their ""new system"" didn't seem to register that we weren't paying through direct debit, but through bank transfers. It took months of calling, writing, sending proofs of payment from the bank, but it just never seemed to get sorted. Each time I called, they seemed to have no record of my previous call. They had no idea what was going on. Nothing was being done. We tried complaining only to be told they don't take complaints over the phone (how ridiculous), and that we had to write to their complaints depatment. We did, several times, we got no response.  Then the debt collectors started chasing us up. A different one every week, and every time we had to fend them off, refusing payment of 'admin fees' because the bill is in dispute. Still, spark weren't paying any notice to what we were telling them. It wasn't until May that they finally realised the error and did something to correct it. July came around again and we moved to a new house, again rented, and again it was supplied by Spark. We switched suppliers as soon as we could and awaited final bills from Spark for the old and the new house. It took 3 months for the final bill of the old house to arrive. Nearly 11 months later, right when we're thinking it's all over and they're gone from our lives, last week we recieve a new bill demanding GBP150 for the new house final settlement. Now, only 1 week after that turns up, the debt collectors are chasing it too.    Spark have been nothing but an intense nightmare for the last 2 years. They are a terrible company who can't even get something as simple as a bill right, who ignore their customer's complaints and don't even bother to get in touch themselves over a bill dispute. Instead they quickly send out an army of debt collections agencies to harras and intimidate their customers. They are rude, they are incompetant, they are entirely unprofessional. I have told everyone I know about how bad Spark is, I hope my message reaches even more so nobody else has to suffer."
3199|-----AVOID AT ALL COSTS-----  My letting agents (Woods of Bristol) joined my student house to spark without our knowledge or consent. High prices, infrequent bills and never acknowledged my regular direct debits, resulting in them sending threatening letters promising a visit from baliffs.  What is more worrying, they just do not let you leave them - it took four months to get rid of them due to their illegal blocking of my transfer to another company with absolutely no explanation. After GBPGBPs spent on phone calls to speak to surly, unhelpful employees who claim not to know of any transfer blocking or even sending red bills, I eventually had to get the energy ombudsman involved to make them transfer me.   I look forward to the day I see their chief executives hauled over the coals by the legal system  
3200|Spark Energy were the suppliers on a student flat I moved into in August 2009. I had no problem with them until December 2009, when I should have received a new quarterly bill. They emailed me to say they were changing their system and we would hear from them as soon as it was up and running.  Six months later after we last heard from them, in April 2010, we received a bill for GBP300, which seemed a lot for a small flat of three girls, who weren't there all that often. When we rang them, they said we'd been paying the minimum amount on the previous two bills, something which neither the statements, nor the customer representatives we spoke to, had mentioned. We paid the GBP300, only to then receive a bill a month later saying we hadn't paid them.   I rang and told them we had paid, and the person I spoke to agreed that we had, but it hadn't been recorded on our payments account. They said they'd ammend that and we thought it was all sorted.  We then received a letter from a debt collection company, saying that if we didn't pay this bill we'd be taken to court. My housemate mistakenly thought this was a new bill, and rang the company and paid her third. When I rang Spark to point out their mistake, they refused to refund her. She eventually rang and managed to get a third of her money back, with the rest contributing towards our next bill.  Spark continued to refute that we had paid any of our bills since December 2009, contacting a different debt collection company, Buchanan, Clarke and Wells, to collect payments for bills we had already paid. When I rang to tell them we were moving out of the property, and asked for a final bill, I was first told we owed them GBP210, then at a later point told it was GBP120. I said we'd wait till we received the final bill in writing before paying.   The final bill took until September 2010 to arrive, when we'd moved out in July, and was only for GBP90. And after all that a few weeks later, I received a bill for August, for which the new tennant's should have taken responsibility. When I phoned them, however, they agreed I didn't owe them that money, they'd just sent the bill to me automatically, because my home address was still on the account, even though I'd CLOSED the account (supposedly)  Overall, Spark Energy are generally an appalling company. If you can avoid having dealings with them then do, they have caused so much stress. They're jokers who don't have a clue what they're doing.
3201|AVOID SPARK! THE MOST UNTRUSTWORTHY ENERGY COMPANY!  I have read a few reviews on this website and they all have elements that match my experience with SPARK ENERGY.  I was also made by my letting agent (TDL) to join SPARK for electricity. When it turned out that gas was provided by a different supplier and that it cost us more to have two different suppliers we eventually managed to convince the agent to let us switch to a different supplier.  I called SPARK and arranged for the transfer. I paid all the final bills and it  all seemed to have been sorted out. 8 months down the line while I was in a new flat already SPARK started sending me texts that I haven't paid my final bills and that I will be charged for delays. I tried contacting them numerously via telephone and e-mail. I was requesting the alleged bill so that I could see what they wanted to charge me for. I kept leaving messages, somebody from SPARK would write them down, promise to call back and that of course never happened. Bad communication and customer service is another infamous feature of SPARK. SPARK was quick to pass my details on to a debt collector (without sending me the bill that I requested repeatedly - is that even legal??). Finally, I wrote a letter to the debt collector describing the whole story and they in turn promised they had arranged with SPARK for the bill to be sent out to me. It has  been a week and I am still waiting... The debt collectors could be surprised because this bill to my knowledge doesn't exist.  If anyone knows where to report SPARK for all their dodgy actions I would be very grateful if you could point me in the right direction. Thank you
3202|Spark Energy has the worst Customer Service I have ever experienced. Today I waited over 40 minutes to speak to an adviser and still did not get through. This has now happened time and time again.  After travelling a 160 mile round journey to have a meter changed in a rented property, nobody turned up. On trying to contact them, I was told someone would phone back within five days!!!! Get real. This company is clearly understaffed and should not be allowed to trade. As soon as I can convert to a new supplier I shall.
3203|Moving into a new property I had no idea who my supplier was and having recieved no commuciations for over six months I finally tracked down that it was spark energy (to my misfortune). I called them up and was told it was not their policy to ever send out bills! Anyway to cut a long story short it took me a further year and hours on the phone to get a bill- each time I phoned up they would have no record of my previous calls. After escaulating it with the omdusmdman so I could switch I finally got it sorted- although it took them 6 month after switch to bill me for final GBP20 but I was so glad to be rid of them I did not complain and paid up.  Now we have been getting aggressive letters from SP Collect for the previous owners' bill addressed to the occupier. Calling them, they said they cannot do anything until contacted by Spark. Spark phone line and website site has been down the past few weeks and finally called consumer direct, who said this supplier was one 'they recieved a lot of complaints about'! No wonder!  Cannot advise people to select another supplier enough. I wanted to give 0 stars, but the site will not let me!
3204|the company is a joke, they dont return calls, emails and also in 2011 still do not have the ability to transfer calls internally.   They didnt give up my supply until 2 months had passed from the request, they advised that they didnt give up supply until accounts are settled in full - I paid in full and now 3 months later they are chasing me for a final bill. Complaint now made to the energy ombudsman.  My previous first encounter of this poor excuse for a company was in November 2011 when I wanted to switch supplier, felt like i was held to ransom by them, I called and called and called to find out why they wouldn't give up my supply in the end it to for me to say that I was recording all calls to the company and building a case to submit to the energy ombudsman against them. After explaining this to the agent I was told nobody was available to deal with my complaint however I would be called back in the morning - low and behold no phone call until the afternoon time.  I again explained about recording calls etc and in the end Spark took the metre reading and confirmed that the supply would now be transferred and I paid the final bill to them.  My advice would be, dont bother wasting your own time or money on a phone call to these clowns, avoid like the plague if possible. But keep note on all your dealing with them and send everything through the energy ombudsman, hopefully enough complaints to them will result in them getting closed down. Oh and they are only getting a * as i have to select one, spark deserve nothing 
3205|I have NEVER had this many problems with a company in my life!!  They were the electricity supplier for the house I bought 6 months ago..  -They refused to hand over supply to British gas until I paid an outstanding bill for the period in which I didn't even own the house!  -They sent me a bill for over 5 times the amount it should have been. When I insisted they were wrong and gave them the correct meter readings they sent the wrong bill AGAIN.  When I refused to pay for electricity I had not yet used and asked for the correct bill to be sent....THEY SENT A DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY AFTER ME!!!  -If you request a ring back...you won't get it! -If you make a complaint... they don't answer it. -If you get very angry and make an official complaint, they say they'll rectify the problem and get in touch within 20 days...guess what??? They do neither.   I can't believe that after 6 months on continuous phone calls, e-mails etc I still cannot get this ridiculous excuse for a company to actually send me a bill for the amount of electricity I used and stop sending debt collection teams to threaten me!!   It's not like I haven't offered to pay the bill, I just can't for the life of me get them to work out how much I owe and not send bills for extortionate amounts.  If I can offer any advice... never ever ever go with this company.  The crazy thing is they keep sending leaflets to me telling me how much money I can save if I stay with them...  urmm that'll be a big fat NO!
3206|I've Just been contacted by Spark Energy saying that I owe them my final payment of 40 quid... three years after I closed my account with them.   Why it's taken three years to generate this 'bill' is beyond me. The woman on the phone apologised and was quite friendly, but I was so angry at the situation that i wasnt very nice to her.   Her excuse for the lack of generation was that I didnt give them a forwarding address - surely they should have asked for one.   We, my flatmates at the time, stupidly paid - 60 pounds a month for 2 years. and to get this bill sent through to my phone and email 3 years later is a joke.   Expensive, unorganised and rediculous! Avoid!  
3207|Most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with! They hijacked my electricity and refused to hand over the account back to British gas! Every time I tried to call them I just got an answering machine and I'm still to this day receiving bills and text messages telling me I owe them money! Even thought it has all been sorted out with British gas and British gas are my supplier! I would stay well away a bunch of cowboys and just a big joke! 
3208|Spark Energy are the worst company I have ever dealt with... aside from Atlantic Telecom who went bust years ago.  Anyway my advice is to AVOID THIS COMPANY like the plague.  They have NO CUSTOMER SERVICE whatsoever. You can leave a message for someone to call you back (saying that it can take up to 5 days!!!!!!!!). I'm still waiting after 30 days for any form of communication from this TRULY AWFUL company. They can't even get their estimates anywhere close to what they should be. Spark Energy estimated something around 30% higher than what it should have been (bearing in mind that we are also heading towards Summer). I called to complain and due to the fact NO-ONE BOTHERED TO RETURN MY CALL they are extorting me each month via direct debit. I'm currently in the process of moving energy company and I know that the next battle will be how do I get the money back that these cowboys owe me??!   I'd give it zero stars for all criteria if at all possible. TRULY AWFUL  The fact that they also fail to monitor forums like this, twitter etc reinforces the point that this behind-the-times 'company' is way behind the times and doesn't deserve your business.   It's a service company which resells energy. Running such a company really isnt rocket science. It's all basics which Spark Energy have royally screwed up at every possible juncture.  TOTAL RUBBISH!!  
3209|Utter joke. Was in process of changing away from them, letter recieved telling me tocontact within 4 working days,.....recieved and postmarked 5 days after the date of the letter. as i didntcontact the transfer requestcould be cancelled, so wouldnt be able to transfer away from these useless idiots....in addition a call back takes another 5 days, so i will also owe an additional 15% of the balance.....contact WATCHDOG!!!!!!!!!.....LETS PUT THESE IDIOTS OUT OF BUSINESS
3210|my letting agency has set my account with spark without asking me.i paid my first bill on the fifth day after its been issued.in 2 weeks i received a letter from debt collectors. it took me ages to reach spark and to tell them its a mistake.after they set a direct debit GBP31 pounds each month. i have made lots of phone calls providing my meter readings but i never been issued another bill for 16 months.now i received a huge bill with estimated readings and i have been told my new direct debit will be GBP 263. i called the bank and i stopped the direct debit. after i sent spark a formal complaint and i said i want a proper bill with my real usage which i will be happy to pay. i received two envelopes from them, with 2 different bills for the same period, far more less than the previous one,but both of them incorrect. i transfered my case to energy ombudsman and i emailed them i am not going to pay yet. i am worrying about my credit file as well. if somebody could tell me please if the ombudsman decision is not satisfactory for me, to whom i have to complaint next? trading standarts? or watch dog? people, this is not my country, but i keep all the rules, i pay my taxes and bills on time and i dont get any benefits. i would like to be good citisen but i am really having a huge problem with this funny company. if somebody could advice me what to do i will be very grateful. thanks
3211|Absolute bunch of incompetent bullys. I cannot believe, that after so many complaints, that this lot are allowed to continue to trade.They are a disgrace and should have been shut down long ago.
3212|I have had the worst experience of my life with Spark! They have never returned any of my calls when I query their incredibly high bills. I only ever received a call back once i complained to the estate agents, which leads me to my main point....THE ESTATE AGENTS ARE GIVING SPARK ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS!!! Every single one of us that has had our supply changed without our consent needs to complain to their estate agents to make them aware that Spark are nothing but crooks!! You cant escape Spark if their is a debt on your account, so they purposely overcharge you, so you cant escape!!! You end up paying their high charge to clear the account & only then when you're well out of pocket are you able to join a competent supplier. SPARK SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN!!! If enough people complain to the appropriate people, these crooks will be brought to justice.
3213|I have never been more angry with a company in my life. How on earth do they continue to trade? I wish I could take them to court but wouldn't want to waste my energy or money. I have left their supply over a month ago and they are still sending me estimates as my final bill. The property has been empty for 3 months, and they want to charge me 400?? I have called them from December to pay a real bill instead of an estimate, still no one can calculate my usage.They are already threatening to add 15% to my bill if I don't pay their estimate (which is wrong my approx GBP280. I am worried though if I don't pay that it could affect my credit rating. Does anyone no more on this topic?  
3214|Complete bunch of crooks, criminally inept with a customer service thats worse than a joke. They lie and when they say they'll ring you back they never do. Increased my debits by over 300% when they overestimated my usage and then when told they were wrong they agreed to a GBP10 a month increase - then proceeded to take out debits at the initial 300% rate - morons!!. They have owed me money since Sept last year and it has now got to the point where I will be forced to take legal action against them to recover it. I would urge any potential customers to avoid these bunch of incompetents at all cost!!
3215|(ZERO STARS) Complete shower of theives. Moved into a lovely new flat and this lot were the current suppiers, Immediately smelt a rat with them wanting a direct debit payment. They made it very difficult to change suppliers - even being hung up on - and now 8 months after leaving them they have sent a bill for GBP1,700 out of nowhere when we dont even use them. Ridiculous, and after reading the reviews here and seeing the burden they have caused upon others I sincerely hope they get shut down.
3216|I know its been said over and over again, But...  Useless, Unhelpful and couldnt be bothered are many ways of describing this company.  Firstly, the bills were wrong, Waaaay over what our meters were reading. We let them know, and the girl on the phone agrees that they owe us money and they would sort it out for us. Cue the phone ringing about half hour later saying that the girl had made a mistake and we owe them an extra GBP300... Yeah right, Foxtrot Oscar. Still trying to sort that one.  Secondly, Whilst still trying to sort the first one, we get a bill. We pay it online, and an error message comes up. So we phone them up and pay them again over the phone and are told it wouldnt matter and it would be fine. Bank statement comes through... Waaay, Spark Energy have doubled their money from us to the tune of approx GBP400... Brilliant.  Trying to sort this one out and they have told us they made a mistake over the phone and were sorting it out. The girl we spoke to then was actually competent. But she said the team would ring us back, No they wont. They say that every single time. We are now about 6-7 weeks down the line and Spark energy have informed us that the debt collectors will be coming round.   Which they have, and we discussed it with them. They are actually EXTREMELY good. They left, They phoned us back and they said they would help us chase it and she would get onto their backs for us aswell due to it being unfair.  Just rang Spark again after some stranger knocked at the door and asked for the name of the contract holder, then left and wouldnt tell me what it was for. And would you believe it? They will call me back. To which I have told them no they wont and have been given an email to send to but they have no idea how long a reply will take to come to me.  Fair play Spark, You are a bunch of morons. I would love nothing more than to leave you, But even when we try that you still screw us over.  Rant over, Dont use. They have caused us so much grief and we have only lived here for 6 months.  Just to add, Love the fact I have to say these are my own views...!
3217|Useless Bunch of jokers.I haven't received any bill since 18 Months despite regular complaints. The customer care Number is answered by some phone answering service and they never get back to you. All the emails goes to a black hole. I moved away from them last November 2010 and till April 2011 I haven't received my final bill.
3218|This company has become the bane of my life.  I rented a flat supplied by this travesty of an outfit, the billing was NEVER EVER right, they insisted GBP200 a month estimate for a single person in a 1 bed flat was normal.  I ended up monitoring usage myself and after innumerable complaints, emails to the apparently unread customer service address with details and readings, even sent them their OWN emails admitting mistakes back someone finally came on board with sensible figures and offered the faintest glimmer of sense.  I left the flat in June last year, submitting final readings to both letting agent and Spark, expecting any final balance would be forwarded to me as agreed.  Nothing until........  An email last week DEMANDING GBP2017 final bill. No actual itemised statement, just a DEMAND to pay them GBP2000+ pounds for a tiny flat I haven't lived in for a year. I got in touch with the agent, at the first mention of the word 'Spark' she sighed and muttered 'unbelievable'.  She said she would get onto her contact at spark, nothing heard since.  So now- another angry letter, another pointless email to an address that looks like it goes straight to 'deleted' and,I fully expect, another terse extortion letter.  They are, without a doubt, the worst company I have EVER had to deal with. Its quite mindnumbing how arrogant, ignorant and incompetent they are. I cannot see how they are allowed to trade. I'm seriously thinking of approaching the BBC watchdog programme about this shower of incompetents.  I sometimes get lost for words trying to describe how utterly dire they really are. ANYONE who is with them and reading this-leave them. Now. get all your readings right and leave, go to ANYONE they will be better.  Anyone who has suffered like I have - we should all get together with a concerted campaign to get them shut down by the regulators. Im only sorry I cant rate it with zero (or minus) stars.  DREADFUL!!!!!!!!!
3219|"This is going to sound like yet another drop in the ocean, but just to reaffirm what all other reviewers are saying, here is my story:  One year into my tenancy, I got a letter from my Lettings Agent (Howards) telling me they were appointing Spark as their ""preferred supplier"", and that I just need to ""sit tight"" while they took over the supply. Of course I didn't agree to this unreasonable intrusion, in no way supported by the tenancy contract; they contacted Spark and reassured me no transfer will be carried out.   Much to my surprise, two months down the line the transfer did indeed happen, and I had to spend considerable time and effort trying to get Spark to revert it. This they only did once I involved the Energy Ombudsman, after having to put up with ridiculous delays and misdirections.   The supply was returned to the original supplier, which as mandated by the Erroneous Transfer Customer Charter resumed the billing from the moment they took on. All what  I got from Spark was a rather disingenuous apology, simply stating that their mistake would result in no charge to me, as if trying to avoid any possible litigation.   Further two years passed without me having heard anything from these ruffians, and completely out of the blue I get a letter from a credit recovery firm demanding payment for the period of the erroneous transfer. Fortunately I had kept all documents from the incident and I could immediately refute it. I gives me the shivers just to imagine the pain they would have put me through if I didn't.  I cannot really understand how a company with such fraudulent practices can be even allowed to operate, moreover when the Energy Ombudsman is well aware of them. The general public is just being bullied by this company, and nothing seems to be done about it.   "
3220|"I have just received a txt, email and post correspondence from Spark Energy after 10 months of living at my property and using N Power and been told that I have a new account and need to provide details of the meter to them. Thankfully seeing as I never set the account up and had never even heard of them I refused and demanded to know who set the account up and what details they had for me? They said that they didn't know either and to contact my Letting agent and Landlord. The letting agent said that the tenant is responsible for utilities and do not get involved and would never pass any details like this to anyone as it is a breach of contract (I have been with my agent for over 3 years and never had anything like this happen before) The owner of my flat only knows my name as the agent deals with everything else and if they want to contact me they must go through my agent!   I have reported them to the ombudsman and currently having the matter investigated for potential FRAUD! Spark informed me that no one but me can set an account up and as I indicated to them, who else would benefit from setting up an account like this but Spark themselves!  From the notes on here it would not surprise me if Spark are obtaining details and setting up accounts in the hope that people will just use their services! My letters and emails said ""thanks for setting up your account, all we need is your meter serial number then we you can make the switch"" "
3221|AVOID SPARK ENERGY.  Just read any of the other reviews.  Their customer service is terrible, their bills are exorbitant and their staff seem completely untrained and for the most part either disinterested or downright rude. For just three months living in a property they charged us GBP450!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We are now with Swalec and have never looked back.
3222|Please, please, please avoid using this energy supplier.  Having the misfortune to be lumbered with this company following the signing a new tenancy agreement, they can only be described as totally useless. They are likely to overcharge, ignore correspondence, pester and harass.  Please read all the other poor reviews here and elsewhere. How they continue to trade is a complete and utter mystery.    
3223|Abysmal. Overcharged me and promised me a full refund. Still waiting two months later, they aren't even returning my emails. Aggressive sales tactics, appalling service, and they aren't even cheap.  Avoid at all costs.
3224|Sparkenergy - How dare You as a company have the audacity to cause the stress and sheer frustrations experienced by my daughter. She lives in a 1 bedroomed flat and apparently her bill has escalated from GBP70.00 per month to GBP500.00. From all accounts anyone considering this energy company DO NOT GO NEAR THEM!   
3225|This page full of reviews about spark energy is completely true, do not go anywhere near them. They are the worst company in the world. They don't even deserve 1 star.
3226|have been stuck with Spark for almost 2 years now.  Every time they send a bill it is ridiculously high.  My wife calls and they say its wrong ask for a reading and send a new bill.  The new bill is often higher than the original.  Latest review for the year said that my bill was over GBP6000 for a 2 bedroom flat!!!  Tried to contact via telephone no answer.  Emailed twice and was told someone would be in touch within 48 hours heard nothing.  yesterday got another letter saying that they were taking a direct debit of GBP570 out my bank the next day 2nd of april but the letter is only posted on march 30th.  I have had to report them now to the energy Ombudsman this is a complete joke and they are con artists.
3227|Absolute Jokers! Moved into a property Aug 1st and by Christmas I apparently owed nearly GBP400! I live on my own in a two bedroom apartment. I called to complain and give yet further meter readings only to find the next week my bill had then jumped from GBP400 to nearly GBP800. It is now March and I have called these guys a dozen times to resolve. nothing ever happens except being chased for money by Spark and their Debt Collector for money I don't owe. As it stands the bill would work out at over GBP150 per month for gas and electricity for one person in a two bedroom apartment - really?? My girlfriend has just had a bill from them too at her house even though she has never asked for Spark to take over the supply and British Gas run the account and have no record of this ever changing!
3228|"AVOID THIS COMPANY they are a joke.  I have tried to talk with them over a disputed bill on 4 occassions.  Each time someone spends time writing down my complaint in great detail because their customer service people are ""too busy"" and promises to call back within 24 hours. Of course nobody ever calls back and now they threaten me with a collection agent. They claim we owe nearly GBP700 for 2 months electricity!"
3229|My son has been trying to contact Spark since November last year with various emails and phonecalls to dispute his account when he tried to change suppliers They have never replied once but sent debt collectors leaving threatening letters and still will not reply to his enquiries!!    We recommend no one ever gets involved with this company.  It was his landlord that recommended this supplier!!!!!!
3230|My worst nightmare!!!!!  I had been with Spark energy for a year and a half before switching to another company last August. I was informed that I was in credit of GBP234.54. Since then I have been chasing with phone calls never returned, emails and letters of complaint. Every single time I am told that somebody will look into my complaint and that it will be dealt within 20 working days!  I am still waiting for my money.  Worst customer service ever!!!! STAY AWAY from them!!!
3231|STAY AWAY!!!! They are absolutely useless. My friend and I were with them in a rented flat for over 2 years; we were told to use them by the landlord however after leaving it has taken just shy of 9 MONTHS!!!! to get our rebate of over GBP300 back following endless phone calls, emails and official complaints. Finally, threats of involving the energy ombudsman got them to repay. They're fraudsters and cons, who don't care about their customers and do ALL they can to get and keep your hard-earned money.
3232|"I've experienced Spark's laughable and ridiculous Customer Service for just over one week now and my - such a lot has happened in that time. The letting Agents involved Spark, without telling either myself or the landlord, who was in fact paying the bills andquite happy with EDF for both fuels. Spark's input:  1) bombard the property with ridiculous amount of posted paperwork, even though they did not have a registered name for the property.  2) rejected my own supplier's (British Gas) to take over the supply of fuel, so I have had to start the process again with British Gas, meaning it will take a further 6-8 weeks, instead of 2 weeks.  3) once my details were registered with Spark for the interim period, they send more paperwork addressed to ""the tenant/occupier"", with conflicting and bewildering statements. I still have not recieved anything with my name on it.  4) Despite the process with Spark only starting on the 21st february (according to one of their many letters), I received a letter notifying me of a ""Notice of Warrant Action"" - claiming Spark were seeking a warrant through a local magistrate to forcibly enter the property to fit equipment to recover outstanding debts. Not enough time has elapsed since 21st February to even warrant a red letter, let alone warrant action!  5) Upon contacting the number on the warrant mnotice, I spoke with possibly the most dis-interested and unhelpful Customer service representative I have ever had the displeasure to deal with in my life (I am an ex- CS Director). After being given the impression i was phoning someone who was in their living room and had been woken up by my call, I explained the situation and asked for assurances that action would not be taken. She got not give me any assurances she said, so I asked for an assurance that someone from CS would contact me as soon as possible to discuss this. She could not assure me that this would happen and said she could ""ask"" them if they would call me. No one has called me yet since this call (4 working days).  6) I have tried calling their highly ineffectual CS number several times, being put through once, which directs me to a message claiming they all very busy and then disconnects me. When I finally get through, I had to explain everything again, as the information did not seem to be on their system, I was told i would receive a call back from someone at the company. 3 working days later, I have still to receive a call from Spark energy.  I am extremely concerned that now my name is on their system somewhere, it will become linked with the warrant action notice through further inefficiency, however I cannot contact them. Have thried their website this morning, however it seems to be down............  Well done Spark Energy, you are useless and redundant at the one thing you are supposed to do. My next stop will be to contact my Solicitor and ask for a letter to be sent, threatening legal action if the notice is not withdrawn and confirmed in writing to me."
3233|I am so relieved i am not the only person who feels the way i do about this so called company.  My elderly parents have now recieved a warrant of entry to thier property after receiving bills even though they are supplied by another energy company.  I have been trying to sort out this mess for three months without any success. My parents are completely stressed out and frustrated  as well as my self. Why are they allowed to treat people like this and cause so much anxiety?. 
3234|This company does not even deserve one star, unfortunately this review requires at least one star.  My experience with this company, to cut the story short, is that they are an inefficient, arrogant, unhelpful, incompetent organisation that should be investigated by the office of fair trading.  Upon taking a new tenancy on a house, Spark Energy refused to allow my previous supplier to take over the supply. Spark then failed to send bills to me and claimed that I had refused to pay or communicate with them, all of which is totally incorrect. I have always paid my accounts to all utility companies on time and by direct debit arrangements.  If you take my HONEST ADIVICE ..... DON NOT USE SPARK ENERGY
3235|SPARK ENERGY = NIGHTMARE......Rented a property through Your Move, who informed me that EDF were my supplier. Then 2 weeks into my tenancy changed to Spark without my consent & been a nightmare ever since. The bills are incredible & always incorrect, but its impossible to get a reply from them. I did get a call back once from Spark after i put a complaint into Your move & their attitude is disgraceful & still not helped with the problems. Going to report to ofgem, keeping all correspondence to back myself.
3236|Poor service, you can never get hold of anyone and if your lucky enough to do so they have no idea... I was with them 13 months ago paid my final bill, and now just started to receive automated txt and phone calls for final payment.I have no idea and you can not get hold of anyone... stay way clear    They are not even worth a star .....
3237|I completely agree with each and every review on this site.  My life is being made hell by Spark Energy.  They have instructed aggressive debt collecters to retrieve money which i do not owe and for a period in which i have paid British gas as my supplier.  I now have solicitors and Trading Standards involved as there business practices are illegal.   Avoid this company at all costs.  They dont make that easy to do though as even when you switch your supplier they still claim they have paid.  Evil company with awful values.
3238|Completely and utterly useless.  Never answer the phone - the line just goes dead.  Try to charge you a fortune monthly.  I can't even get in touch with them now that we've left the property.  However hassled you're feeling when you move into your let, don't stick with this company.  Just switch to someone who's half decent.
3239|I have never dealt with a company as unprofessional and dishonest as Spark. The difficulties I have had with them over the last two years make for dull reading; but, to summarize, I was billed too late and constantly had creditors on my back for money I was not aware I owed. When I eventually broke free from them (November 2010), I was GBP265 pounds in credit.  I chased this credit constantly over three months.  25 days ago I was eventually told I would get my money back in 21 days. This was obviously a false claim. Whatever you do, STEER CLEAR of this company.  They are ineffectual and immoral: they have as good as stolen my money.
3240|We switched from spark energy 2 years ago due to them being complete morons, customer service stinks, bill's are wildly inaccurate,even now we are getting letters from debt collection agencys all with varying wild amounts, we've had to instruct solicitors to sort them out.  Simply put stay well away from spark, mickey mouse outfit.
3241|The Worst energy company in the WORLD; inaccurate meter readings, have signed us up to thw wrong tariff; no one is ever there from the company they are always on a 'training day', and so we get put thrugh to a call centre. Respondance to emails is every 3 - 4 weeks; respondence to letters has never happened.  I really to wnat change but cannot until I have finished my dispute with them, as such this company is forcing me to stay with them but they are not responding to me
3242|One of the worst energey companies in the UK. Bills never accurate, refunds never made, worst customer services and even MD doesnt reply to letters. Stay AWAY!!!
3243|Like many others, my letting agents have signed me up to Spark energy without my knowledge.  I moved into my rented property 26th Sept 10, my moving in letter from my letting agents specified Scottish Power as my supplier.  December i get wacked with a bill for 400.00 for 3 months usage, on a 2 bed apartment.  Still here now trying to move supplier and my bill is currently 696 and rising.  Who is at fault here spark or our letting agents for signing us up, after all it is the letting agents getting commission for signing us up.  Im a single parent family and will be ending my tenancy shortlived if this continues as these bills are ridiculous and the threats from Spark for payment, are well more than stressfull for anyone, avoid with all costs and people check your tenancy agreements, as if it states spark energy choose another letting agent or refuse it point blank
3244|I thought Spark Energy were a fraudulent buch of criminals but I know think they are merely incompetent.  Why this change of mind?  Because they use a FREEPOST address (Freepost RRSB-BXUT-UZSU, Spark Energy Ltd, Ettrick Riverside, Dunsdale Road, Selkirk, TD7 5EB).  Many companies have stopped using FREEPOST because it is so easy for disgruntled customers to rack up high post bills by sending empty envelopes or even redirecting junk mail to them.  Not only does each letter have to be processed in the company's office (wasting time and resources) but each letter sent costs the company money on postage. I suspect that if Spark Energy were aware of this they would not have selected a FREEPOST address - another example of their incompetence. 
3245|awful company send me bills and threats even when i have switched suppliers stay well clear!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cant get through to customer services left several messages and the call is never returned i have never signd up with them and am not even sure how they got my details! Called today and the offices are closed!  Not even sure these are legitimate? stay well clear would rather have no gas supply rather than have to deal with this comapny, reporting them to watchdog and ombudsman today!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!
3246|AVOID, I have no choice as the landlord/agency has selected this supplier, they keep sending bills based on wrong meters or trying to charge twice on the same reading on two bills. I would give no star if the system allows me.
3247|I was erroneous transferred over without my knowledge when Your Move recommended me to Spark.  Spark did not contact me until after they had found out who my supplier was (Your Move did not even know) and had already contacted them and told them I was leaving them.  The first I heard was when I got a letter from EDF saying that they were sorry to hear I was leaving them.  That was news to me!  I phoned up Your Move straight away and they told me I had only been recommended to Spark and could go with whomever I chose to, so I phoned up Spark and said to Customer Services I was not going with them, to which the snotty reply was, what does your landlord say about that.  I told him 1.  My landlord does not pay the bill and 2. I have already had it confirmed I can go with whichever supplier I want.  That was 19 November 2010, when they then went ahead and gave an estimated meter reading to EDF to close my account with EDF.  My gas supply was then taken over on 7 December when I gave a meter reading to the automated service they ask all new users to leave a reading on as well as contacting Customer Servicest to ensure the correct reading was given to EDF.  Despite all my troubles they gave a much lower reading to EDF which is tantamount to fraud and basically edging into criminal law!  They acknowledged on 15 December both were erroneous transfers and although I was back with EDF for electric by 5 January 2011, I am still waiting for them to sort out the gas.  I have two letters confirming erroneous transfers, that I will not have to pay Spark anything and that instead I will be billed from EDF as if I had never left to find last night a letter stating Spark have blocked my transfer.  I called customer services and waited for 50 minutes before being put through to customer services who could only get someone to call me back as they did not have security clearance to help.  How pathetic. Their customer services clearly are no better than the rest of the company.  They obviously have no training and no clue apart from how to poach others customers illegally and then charge then way above the odds for the same service.  I am going to pull together my story of this unsolved saga and forward to all the newspapers, watchdog, magazines that print real life stories and send to everyone I can on face book.  I have see how these campaigns, if sent to enough people, can have the desired effect, namely that bullying companies who behave unscrupulously are brought to ACCOUNT AND BELIEVE ME, THIS COMPANY WILL BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT.
3248|AVOID THIS COMPANY!!! We have had nothing but grief, receiving letters from debt collectors before we had even received our bills, you call up and there is no-one 'trained' to talk to you so they have to call you back (WHICH THEY NEVER DO!!) it took us about 7 attempts to switch supplier as Spark kept stopping it, even though we had our payments all up to date.  They also overcharge you for 'ending connections call outs' yet we had no-one come to our property the day we were told, as our electricity meter is inside our flat.  JUST AVOID THEM.  Nothing but rude, causing sleepless nights.  I am glad we have nothing more to do with them. 
3249|"Spark Energy has dishonest, deceitful business practices and you will end up paying WAY more than you need to for your electric. Don't believe a word they say, I just realized they've been charging me up to $150 more a month for power than my local company. Highway robbery, Buyer BEWARE! They hook you with a low starting price and then unknown to you they start charging you what they call a ""competitive"" rate... without notice. In reality, their ""competitive"" rate is MUCH higher than my local service, BGE. I'm so sick of companies that don't stand behind their sales pitches and have no regard for the buyers well-being."
3250|I have had nothing but trouble from this company. It has cost me a lot of money being with them. When I moved in they led me to believe that they were the energy supplier but they weren't. Their customer service is awful - very frustrating. I would recommend that you avoid this company at all cost.
3251|When I moved house, I wanted to keep my previous supplier so I phoned up and let them know.  However, after I moved, I found that Spark Energy had taken over my account without my consent, or a meter reading for that matter. They claimed that YourMove had a clause in the tenancy agreement which allowed them to do this.  YourMove told me that they never had any such thing and they were trying to stop this from happening. The prices are exorbitant. Three times what I pay with NPower. Also, they make it difficult for you to switch to another supplier. I have had NPower now for two months and Spark are still trying to bill me. Beware!!!
3252|We recently moved into our new home (2 months ago) which previously was rented and had electicity supplied by Spark. Since then we have been trying to switch back to our previous supplier without luck. This company do not have a customer support team just a series of message takers that don't seem to have access to any of your account details, none of whom will call you back. We had given our final meter readings to them about a dozen times before they blocked our service transfer because we hadn't given them our meter readings. We gave them the meter readings again only to receive an email the following day saying they need our meter readings. Having tried to make a complaint with them they have promised that our service transfer will go through next time (scheduled for Monday) but I won't hold my breath and will have my meter readings ready again.   I cannot state this strongly enough, avoid this company if need be generate your own power, get yourself a bicycled powered tv or something. I can only imagine it is just a matter of time before they are on Watchdog, if they haven't been already.  They don't deserve 1 star but I'm forced to give them 1.
3253|I agree with the other reviews here. Spark Energy have the worst customer service I have ever come across. They send you messages telling you that your bill is overdue before you have even received it and continue to do so after you have paid it. Their customer service 'helpline' is useless. Whatever you try to tell them they say 'I can't deal with that now. Someone will phone you back.' And they never do. Luckily my Letting Agents have been really helpful and have put their weight behind me and managed to sort stuff out, but I pity the people who have to deal with this lot alone. Avoid at all costs!
3254|I signed up with a a letting agency Pygott and Crown who switched me to Spark Energy without my consent.  I then started getting huge amounts of money taken from my account!! the Letting agents had given my financial data away to Spark Energy who illegally set up a direct debit and took huge estimated bill amounts from my account. It took a lot of time to get money back. Stay away from this company!!! 
3255|Please be very careful, any tenants and landlords using YOUR MOVE. They have a new clause in their tenancy agreements stipulating that the tenants agree to Spark Energy switching to their service. There's also a new clause in the service contracts for landlords saying that they agree to their properties switching to this service. YOUR MOVE then get a commission from Spark Energy for every person who signs up. Read whatever you're signing very carefully!!
3256|Due to very poor experience similar to an number of other comments I am now trying to get money back that they owe me.  Call, send emails but they never get back. DO NOT use this company they are incapable of managing customer accounts.
3257|Just don't, ever, ever use this company...they are the worst company in terms of cutomer service I have ever dealt with. Bills wrong (am sure deliberately in the hope you pay), you are pursued relentlessly by a debt collector (house calls after one month) for the incorrect bill, then they correct and if you are stupid enough to have paid good luck in the getting the refund! I feel sorry for the prople who have to work for such a rubbish company, you get more professional service at the corner shop. Am still waiting my refund (only GBP60 but it's the principle) from last October - despite chasing for and being promised numerous times has yet to materialise.
3258|After moving into my flat back in November, They lost my move in readings which i only found out a month later to ask why i havent got a bill. After 2 months they sent me a text for my meter readings for febuary which i did online. I then received an electri bill for 130 quid for one month. A few days later i received a bill for nearly 300 from the previous supplier when i rang them they told me they were still suppyling me???? I,m still waiting for a call back from them, NOT IMPRESSED!!
3259|I joined Spark and unfortunately also joined my disabled aunt as well, and now feel very guilty for doing so.. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with, I have spoken with Customer Services, Payments Dept and even the Payments Managers, and none of them seem to either not know what they are doing or dont want to know. Their bilings are always wrong, make sure you always check your bills, and keep a record of your meter readings. My aunt has just received a bill from a last supply dated March 2010! If you are with Spark Energy you should change your supplier now... I have had to put a Star Rating and could only put 1 but would not even put that..
3260|I moved into a flat in Oct 2008 though Ludlow Thompson I was forced to switch to Spark Energy.  I say forced but I didn't know anything about the company so didn't bother to complain and allowed the switch to happen.  There were fine but a year later after comparing prices (and a convincing sales pitch by n-power) I decided to switch.  After paying off my final bill and confirming my account was clear 4 times via customer service over the phone I continued to receive bills.  I always called up and was always told everything was fine and that would be the last bill I received.  I thought I had it sorted as I hadn't received a bill in over 6 months but yesterday (February 17th, 2011, almost 1.5 years after switching) I got a bill for almost GBP600.00.  I've called again but I now have to wait for the 'right team' to call me back which can take up to 5 days as they're very busy.  I bet they are!  Executive Summary: Do not use, and do not agree to be switched by your rental agency.  
3261|I have read allot of the comments made here. my girlfriend has a contract with spark energy. Also through the letting agency. They are abusive with debt collectors. does any body know how to get away from them, surely this cant be lagal in some form or other. she paid the collectors after paying bill GBP60 just to get rid of them. what government let their people suffer like this... riaandebruyn2000@yahoo.com
3262|Today we have received our final bill, having eventually moved from Spark at the beginning of August last year.  This bill, of course is wrong.  I am reluctantly about to ring them for what I am sure will be another round of fighting for a correct bill.  Appalling administration - we wanted to move from them as quickly as possible having been put with them through the letting agents - apparently something which is totally against the law (it is the tenant who decides who supplies their energy, not an agent or landlord). Every bill was incorrect, nothing was done following telephone calls, debt collectors' letters sent and visits made to a confused, elderly lady.  The company should be closed immediately.  DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM.
3263|i am awaiting over GBP600 to be repaid to me by spark energy though they have never supplied my power i was told it would be returned to me onin december they have taken my details  for a d.d. took the money every month for a year this was only noticed when the company suppling me sent debt collectors to my door as other rented property owners i was told i must use spark i now have to pay the supplier i am with the debt thats fine but i need to have my refund from spark.in spite of phone calls e.mails i get nowhere i cannot even get through to the accounts dept they type my details into a computer then forget about me the cost of phone calls will soon be as much as the debt they owe me so be aware of the pitfalls of going with spark energy they are the worst company i have ever had to deal with the stress and frustration it caused me made me ill
3264|"I moved to a new house where British Gas were the provider, I arranged to move to Southern Electric to find out I have been ""taken over"" by Spark, I have never heard of them or signed a thing.  I have not seen a tariff and they are blocking me (4 months now) from moving to my preferred supplier Southern Electric!  They tell me its the letting agents who have done this!!  They also know nothing!!!  Will keep you posted!  Apalling!!!!"
3265|I would strongly warn anyone from entering any form of relationship with Spark Energy.  The company is completely chaotic, and I would go as far to say unethical in its approach.  They are impossible to contact, or have any meaningful communication with, and then resort overly quickly to debt collectors and bullying & harrassment tatics such as court summons.  I have to give full praise to their debt collection agency Chase Solutions who have been unbelievably (and in stark contrast to Spark) helpful in trying to get Spark to acknowledge that they have cashed our cheque of full payment for our account, and to call off a court date they have sent us for two days time.  I dont understand how this company can be allowed to set up and operate without the basic infrastructure in place to be able to deal with its customers.  Why is the regulator not looking into this?  How are they also allowed to sign clients up to their services without speaking to them?  After 6 months of extremely stressful relations, we switched to British Gas last week and are now just trying desperately to close all contact with Spark. 
3266|"Totally agree with everything here. Ceased to be a customer last July, but they kept taking the Direct Debit until October. Rang to arrange refund, did manage to speak to someone who said they would arrange (another) final bill. Never arrived. Back on the phone, call back ""promised""; never happened. I've emailed the 'customer support' address with my complaint so that I can be seen to have followed their process, but I expect they're overwhelmed in the same way as the phones are always busy (presumably with complaints). Owed GBP450 and waiting to get to the ombudsman stage."
3267|I am currently having a nightmare with Spark energy. Similar to everyone.Massively over estimated bills. The last one I spent 3 months trying to deal with was GBP1000 ( this is for a one bed roomed flat over two months.....NOT POSSIBLE!)Details on my bills are wrong every month including my own address. Every time I call, I choose the customer service option and end up in a completely different department where they offer to take a message and call back in 3 days. The last call I made was last month...they still havent called back.  DO NOT EVER USE SPARK ENERGY, IT WILL DRIVE YOU INSANE
3268|WOW...I'm so glad that I'm not the only one thinking that Spark Energy are quite literally the worst company I have ever dealt with! What a shame I was forced to give 1star...I tried to give zero! Agree with all of the negative comments written here...have had similar issues with over-estimated bills, failure to answer calls, failure to return calls/emails and now the debt collector threats! I have made a point of refusing to pay the over-estimated bill so hopefully won't have the problem of getting money back off of them!  Perhaps WatchDog would be interested in them?!  DO NOT DEAL WITH SPARK ENERGY!!!
3269|We were due GBP800 for overestimated bills, The whole thing went on for about three years before i resorted to visiting the headquarters and left with a cheque..Disgrace...
3270|I dont think that this company should be on the market, the worst ever i have experienced in a long time!!!will switch soon and never go back!
3271|OH DEAR MEPlease do not deal with these incompetent merchants. I wish I'd seen this review way back in sept when we started renting this house. We are an army family just moved back from Germany, and we were told that the current supplier was being taken over by Spark as it was the landlord prefered choice, and that they would contact us shortly to arrange meter reading ect. My Husband just agreed without any question, afterall we had enough going on with getting the kids into schools ect. As time went on however there was no correspondance, it was approaching November and I decided to contact them as we had still heard nothing. I was told on the phone that due to the inclement weather all the systems were down..? anyway I was advised that someone would contact me....did they heck, I phoned again, and again and again left meter reading ect asked for letters, was put through to depertment after department....you requests have been put on the system and you'll get a call back. Soooo here I am, its the 8th feb and after contacting British gas to go back to them, I have eventually recieved my first bill from spark!!!!!! 457 pounds....for electricity, still nothing for the gas, and the best thing is they sent another letter to me today too, advising me that they understand that I want to switch to another supplier, so I will need to pay my outstanding balance within 7 days or incure a 15% surcharge!!!!!!!I have again contacted them, because would you adam and eve it the bill they have raised is estimated....dispite my giving them many many readings!!!!ARGGGHHHHHHHHHH I can see its going to be a long process, but I am furious!
3272|It took me months to get a final bill from Spark Energy when I changed to nPower. I finally received the bill to find out I'm GBP293 in credit & am finding it very difficult to get my money back. No one anwsers the customer services line, no one reponds to emails & when was able to leave a message with the meter readings department no one called me back!!!  DON'T USE THEM !!!!!
3273|Probably the worst energy supplier in all of the UK. Call Centre is always busy, even at 8.45am in the morning. Moved immediately to Eon Energy when read the bad reviews. Once I left, ended up paying more than what I was supposed to and was in credit. Have chased up a refund for almost 10 weeks to no avail. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
3274|useless incompitent...disgusting customer care..sorry overflow care..never got to speak to customer care..no call back no nothing 
3275|I have had nothing but trouble from Spark. They took 11 months to refund an overpayment on a closed account, only after I had reported them to the ombudsman and Watchdog. I also have repeatedly received debt collection notices for bills I have paid, have had my card charged 3 times on their website for the same bill - which then was not registered as paid, am still waiting for a refund on another overpayment due to faults in their system.  Their customer services department is shocking. In the last 7 months not a single transaction with them has been problem free.   DO NOT USE THIS SUPPLIER.
3276|Agree with everything I have read so far. Moved in to a rented apartment in Sept 10 and nothing but trouble from Spark Energy since then.  They cannot get my name right, they cannot get my bills right, they do not return calls and then threaten you with debt collectors when : 1. I have paid the bill 2. I have a direct debit set up.  I finally managed to speak to someone in Customer Service, but guess what, they did not have access to my account. The excuse was that my payment took a while to go through because of the bad weather in Scotland in December.   Fortunately I am moving out in March however I suspect that problems and correspondence with them will continue.  I am going to write to the CEO and see what he says about my case and about these reviews
3277|"An absolutely appalling company.  DO NOT use Spark energy.  I am at my wits end with this company.  It is unnecessary to go into detail about how useless they are; the only thing they have done with any great speed or efficiency is instruct debt collectors for the recovery of a ""bill"" for GBP80 where the actual energy use falls way below their ""estimate"".  The GBP80 has been paid of course; I may instruct my own debt collectors to recover my overpayment.  I wish I had done my research before agreeing to use this company... as you are doing your research I hope the reviews help you to chose a good company.  "
3278|Spar are Terrible. We managed to leave them but they sent us a final bill for way above what we should be paying.  Queried the bill and were told we would be called back never did instead got a debt collector contacting us. Have paid the bill due to the sheer stress of the issue and am now going through the complaints procedure with them and will inevitably go through to the ombudsman as I'm sure they wont resolve it. Thankfully everything I did was followed up by email because i know they are so useless. Never return calls never deal with problems. I'm sure they only get customers through letting agents no one would pick them otherwise!! 
3279|"Stay well clear of Spark Energy!!!!!!!!!  I would definitly not recommend this ""company"". We moved into our flat in August 2010, and have only just been able to sort the problems that Spark has caused us. We wanted to do one simple thing and leave, switching to N power. Which they have rejected over and over. Spark could not even organise the direct debit so that we could pay.  When ever we rang we were told to ring back.. by an automated machine which happened over and over again. Customer service is shocking, we have been unable to speak to anyone, and when we have finally managed to do so, the staff have not been helpful.   We have found that if you need to speak to someone use the option for 'bill paying' as they are obviously desperate to get the money. Somebody will answer the phone then (hopefully). But no customer service team at all. The staff say they will write notes on the files, which evidentally they don't.  5 months later, we're still not with our preferred energy provider!"
3280|I waiting three months to get my final bill. The first two were asking for hundreds. Debt collectors got involved. My girlfriend got stressed. They reworked the bill and it came up as a refund. That was three months ago. They still haven't sent me the money. This is on top of two years of the poorest, lamest, most inefficient customer service I have ever witnessed. Every night I turn on the news expecting to hear that they have gone bust. You are a mug if you sign up with these guys.
3281|"Avoid like the plague!!! I moved into a rented property last year and, like many others, was signed up to Sparks Energy without my knowledge. I phoned them saying ""I didn't agree to this"" and it turns out, Romans 'set it up for you'. Spent many hours on the phone to them, aruging with them, and they wouldn't have any of it. I spoke to my landlord and he was in the dark about this and very angry. He then phoned up Romans and demanded a stop to this - EVENTUALLY, I was able to switch energy suppliers but only after many weeks of stress. Not the best start to a new home.  I finally received the 'final bill' which only came to GBP11 and I paid this and thought I had heard the last of it. Oh no. NINE MONTHS LATER, phone calls and letters from a debt collection agency saying I owed them GBP11 and their client was Sparks. Sent them proof of payment (bank account and a screenshot of bank transfer as I thought this may happen) and they STILL refused to accept the bill had been paid. Was told to phone Sparks which I did, was told someone would phone me back, no one did. Sent another two emails demanding this nonsense end and even sent them the proof it had been sent after they claimed their system didn't have any record. Funny that, eh?   They have now accepted I made a payment and the account with the debt collection agency is 'on hold'.   Absolutely disgraceful company, shocking customer service, very amateurish, rude, AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!! Bordering on the illegal. All of the people on here can't be wrong!  PS - as for the letter from Sparks claiming they have a new system etc - absolute rubbish! It's still the same, sh*t service!!!"
3282|They are LIERS. The lied about everything: RATES, SERVICE.. . I wish them get out of business. I would recommend only one thing: STAY AWAIY AF FAR AS POSSIBLE!!!
3283|I moved into a student house in August 2009, and recieved a letter from Spark telling us that they would be providing our gas and electricity. We set up an account in one of the other tenants' name, and each of us would ring up every month to pay our share of the bill. Our letters would always have the wrong amount on, so I would have to ring up to obtain the correct amount. This cost me a fortune in phone bills. On a couple of occasions we were contacted by debt collectors even though we paid on time every month. It then transpired, when we moved out, that they in fact owed US almost GBP130 which would be refunded by cheque so that we could split it between us. Because I was the person who took charge of calling Spark every month, I asked that they send the cheque in my name. 7 months after moving out i finally got the cheque to my address, with someone else's name on so I can't even cash it. I've rang Spark numerous times and they just keep telling me that someone will ring back. They never do. NOT HAPPY!!
3284|Wow, do I wish I saw this review site before letting this pathetic excuse for a company take over my life???!  1st problem - direct debit set at GBP150 when we first moved in (we live in a one bed flat!). We quickly cancelled that....  2nd problem - Continuous over estimated bills despite giving readings, these were regularly around GBP150-200 a month. Every time we had a bill, I had to call to despute.  3rd problem - Cannot even speak to a 'customer service' advisor for most of the time - instead of being on hold they simply cut you off.  4th problem - Have been sent two solicitors letters demanding payment of our bill......despite paying both on time.  I'm now attempting to leave...although from what some of you have said...that may be difficult!
3285|I thought that I was the only one having problems with this cowboy outfit that calls itself Spark Energy!! I left Spark in March 2010 and am still trying to get back the money that they admit is owed to me.  I have never had to deal with such an inefficient shambles of a company before. The customer services just give you the run around - I've heard numerous excuses as to why my money has still not been returned including bad weather, skeleton staff and bank holidays. Don't touch them with a bargepole!! 
3286|I urge everyone who is unfortunate enough to deal with Spark to: 1. Keep photographic evidence of your meter readings periodically 2. Move to another supplier now 2. Never communicate with them by phone (always write) and keep records of 3verything 4. Do not set up a direct debit and always check you bill against the meter reading before paying 5. Complain to the Customer Resolutions dept when a problem arises 6. Escalate that complaint to the Energy Ombudsman if they invariable fail to resolve the matter within 8 weeks 7. Never phone (always write to) the debt collectors, whom Spark will employ even if you pay your bill within 1 day  8. Report the debt collector to the OFT/Consumer Direct whenever they breach the OFT guidelines (easy to find by google) 9. Be patient and do not get angry
3287|Absolute rubbish. Cant seem to get billing or direct debit right. They pass you on to the debt collectors after you haven't paid a bill you either didn't receive or are expected to pay even though there is a direct debit coming out of your account. Spoke to them over 8 times in the last month and they still cant get it tight. Spent over GBP50 in phone bills. Been with them 6 months and now leaving. Utter rubbish, worst company ever. Dont go with them. 
3288|I purchased a house supplied by Sparkenergy (gas and electricity). I decided to switch to EDF which has taken over 5 months to complete mainly due to Sparkenergy's ridiculously tight rules on transfer and ineffectual customer service and their regular refusal to agree to transfer of supply. Delays created by themselves made it very difficult to meet their criteria. The company's customer services system must be the worst I have ever encountered and is no more than a glorified messaging system which is rarely followed up. I would not advise anyone to use this company until they can demonstrate they have decent systems in place.  
3289|I was with Spark for a number of months and had nothing but problems, too many for me to bother to explain! They allowed me to move to British Gas with no problems but now they owe me around GBP250.00, due to their bizzare way of working out what I should have been paying rather than using actual meter readings, and they don't want to deal with it. All I can do when I call them is leave a message for a call back which I never get. It has been 4 months since I moved to British Gas and I have had enough of them. Their service is disgusting! No one should use them!!
3290|DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  my experience with this company has been nothing but a headache when i first moved into the property i was advised in writing by spark that they were the providers for both the gas and electric i switched providers within 5 days of moving in but like so many others on this site they blocked the transfer of my electric stating that this could not be done as there was an outstanding balance on the account from the previous tenant after numerous calls and me painstakingly explaining that this had absolutely nothing to do with me they advised me at the end of may i would be able to switch provider.  4 month later i eventually managed to get my electric moved across to EON little did i know that this would only be the start of my problems as i spend most of my time working away from home i don't really pay much attention to what is coming out of my account. when i did look into it at the end of November i noticed that spark had taken an extra 3 payments out my account after i had moved provider upon contacting them they advised me nothing could be done until the payment had cleared with the bank and they would call me as soon as is did. after a week of no call i got back in contact with them and was advised the payment had not cleared i contacted my bank who advised me the payment had cleared 10 days previous. i then contacted them again and this time i was advised a final bill would be finalised and sent out and they would call me to arrange the credit being refunded into my account. 1 week passed the final bill arrived but yet again no call basically it has now been 8 weeks since i was told the payment would reach the account i'm still waiting and getting really tired of having to chase this joke of a company i have followed the complaints system which advises a call back within 48hours however you get an automated reply saying they will be in contact within 20 working days    DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3291|"I too, like all you poor people have had a terrible time with Spark! After moving into a flat I received a card saying that my electricity was going to be supplied by them and that I could let them know if I wished to stay with my current supplier, but if not, they would take over the supply. Initially my partner and I were happy to do this as they had promising green credentials and the ""little extra"" cinema passes seemed a bonus.   Unfortunately, the happiness stopped there, as shortly after we began to receive monthly bills despite telling them that we preferred to be billed quarterly. On top of this, our bills were about 3 months behind, and even when we had provided meter readings and paid bills, we were receiving threatening debt collection letters - we even had a hand delivered one from a guy ready to disconnect our supply despite the bill being paid 2 months before.!!!  We decided to move back to our previous supplier and so provided Spark (and our new chosen supplier) with a final meter reading so that we could settle the bill with Spark. However, rather than sending us a final bill, they blocked our move, taking a very long time to do this, so we owed them even more money! During this whole stressful process, i also realised that they had our economy 7 meter readings the wrong way round and so were overcharging us on that respect. It took 5+ contacts by phone to get them to sort this and eventually someone promised to sort it out and call me back the following day. 7 MONTHS later and still no callback. I've finally paid the bill today, but I've no idea if it's right. I also want to move to another supplier but I'm anxious that i will have to start this whole process again!!!! What a nightmare - STAY AWAY FROM SPARK! They are incompetent, rude and arrogant and quite frankly THE worst energy company in the UK today! "
3292|This is an awful company, and I definately advise that everyone stay away from them. My bf worked for them 18 th months and thankfully resigned his post over stress and the complete incompetance of the company. from 8am till 6pm he had noting but people like your selves phoning up complaining. The worst was a case of of older woman who switched suppliers by Spark were still taking money from her account 6 months later! Poor management and lack of training, and people just not bothering to 'click the right button' on the computers are to blame, they are also supposed to leave a breif note each time you phone, but most of the employees dont because they all hate their jobs! Hope this helps before you switch!
3293|update from my last review on the 6th January now 10/01/2011  AGAIN STILL WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THE COMPANY SPARK ENEGRY TO GET SENT MY BILL FROM 2 WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS I HAVE PHONED UP 2 TIMES AGAIN SINCE 6TH JANUARY KNOW ONE HAS BOTHERED TO CALL BACK AND STILL NO BILL SENT! IV GIVEN UP AND HAVE CHANGED TO EDF AND IF SPARK WANT THERE MONEY ITS UP TO THEM TO GET IN CONTACT WITH ME AND SEND ME A BILL NOW. SEND THE DEBT COLLECTERS BECAUSE I HAVE PROOF OF EVERY ATEMPT TRYING TO CONTACT YOU TO GET MY BILL AND NOTHING. FOR A MORE EASY LIFE CHANGE TO EDF OR ANY OTHER COMPANY APART FROM THIS RUBBISH ONE SPARK ENEGRY SHOULD BE BANNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3294|I wouldn't even give them 1 star. I don't have the energy to explain all the problems I have had with them. Firstly they gained business from me from a sneaky letter that suggested the flat I just moved into was alreadly had an existing account. Found out a week later it wasnt so tried to change supplier. 5 months later and only my gas has moved. You also can never get through to anyone, and only get promised call backs which never happen!No one can offer me compensation for the amount of calls I have had to make from my mobile. Told me I had to email them, which I have and still havent received a penny. Avoid this company at all costs!
3295|Anothr referal to Spark Energy from a letting agents.  Never delt with such an unprofessional company as Spark. STAY WELL CLEAR OF THESE COWBOYS!!!!  I have read 90% of the reviews on here and connot believe how similar other peoples experiance of this company are to mine!!!! i would never recomend them to anybody. They are an absolute nightmare to deal with!  I was sent threatening txt messages before i had even recieved a Bill or an account number!!! Due to problems with there website, and the automated payment via the phone not working, i actually paid the Bill via a CHAPS bank payment, at a charge of GBP25. Purely so i had a receipt and proof of payment on the day. It later turned out the internet payments had been accepted and the Bill has now been paid 4 times!!!  This is after been threatened and harrassed almost daily, by texts and automated telephone messages, finally with recovery action, All for a bill of under GBP25!!!!  Not once on one of my frequent calls did any of the telephone operaters offer any usefull advice, or seem interestred in the problem. Always took a messages and promised a call back, Never called back. I am now hoping i do not have a massive phone bill as phoned them from my mobile (No landline!!) daily for about 2 weeks, constantly leaving messages.  Awfull company. Bad service, Difficuly to contact, Difficult to Pay!!!,  STAY AWAY!!
3296|WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE DISGUSTING SERVICE AND KNOWONE SEEMS TO KNOW ANY THING I PHONED UP 4 TIMES BEFORE CHRISTMAS AFTER HAVING THREATING PHONE CALLS WHICH WAS WITH A COMPUTER TELLING ME THEY HAVE SENT MY BILL TO DEBT COLLECTERS EVEN AFTER 4 PHONE CALL ATTEMPTS TO TRY AND GET SENT A BILL IS NOW 6/01/2011 AND STILL HAVE NOT RECIEVED A CALL BACK FROM AN ADVICER AS PROMISED OR MY BILL!! THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON AND JUST LIKE TO WASTE TIME SENDING THREATING TEXT MESSAGES AND PHONE CALLS WHY NOT TRY TO SEND A BILL THEN YOU MAY ACTUALLY GET SOME MONEY! THIS HAS BEEN THE SAME PROBLEM FROM THIS COMPANY SINCE WE JOINED IN JUNE 2010 AND HAVE NEVER HAD A RELAXING MONTH SINCE. THEY NEED TO SORT THIS OUT IT IS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I WOULDNT EVEN GIVE THEM 1 STAR. THE COMPANY IS SPARK ENERGY BE WARNED
3297|I am surprised that Spark Energy are allowed to be in business, they behave like Loan Sharks!     They are completely unprofessional and use bullying tactics.   Unknown to me they were electricity providers for my new home(previously a let property)  They prevented me from moving for about 6 months.  Finally I paid them off and changed providers.   Despite numerous telephone calls they are still hounding me with threats, via debt collectors for power they didn't provide.   I have had rude phone calls, debt collectors at my door and sleepless nights over this.   It gives me courage to know I am not alone.
3298|Disgusting Company!!!!!  I tried to change from the to another company over a year ago, however they blocked the gas transfer. I was unwittingly still paying them for both energies for 9 months, yet despite this I was STILL getting billed by them when I cancelled the direct debit. After months and months of chasing them by me and my new supplier I was finally told that I was actually owed over GBP900 by Spark. I was promised this money would be paid into my account no later then Dec 22nd.  Guess what?? NO MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!  And can I get hold of anyone? Of course not!!! STAY AWAY FROM THESE MONEY GRABBING UNPROFESSIONALS!!!
3299|Stay Away fron Spark.  We are letting agents that used them for a brief while.  Every tenant we put there way have complained about their billing customer service.  Even when we try to intervene and help our tenants out they are not interested and will not respond to us as we do not provide further new business for them.  Thankfully we only ever trialed them with a small amount of properties. 
3300|Spark Energy is a terrible terrible company in every important respect.   The biggest problem was that they lost many of my payments which I had to then go to great lengths to prove I had paid. Even after I had proven several of these payments had been made they still lost subsequent ones and I had to begin the process again.   They are far too quick to pass debts to collection agencies especially as it was entirely their fault the bills appeared unpaid. The majority of the letters I received from them threaten some sort of legal action.  Their communication was poor at the best of times and became even more difficult once outside companies became involved.   After lengthy correspondents in which they admitted some of their mistakes my final bill still didn't reflect the total amount I had paid.  No one should have to suffer the misfortune of being one of their customers. If anybody does find themselves in this unfortunate position I suggest they check their bills thoroughly and keep all correspondents and proof of payment close to hand.  In my opinion Spark Energy is the sort of company that should not be allowed to trade. 
3301|Probably the most unprofessional utility company I have ever had the misfortunate to deal with.  Spark Energy set expectations very early, unfortunately the expectations were low.  They were informed on the day I moved in, though when I tried to change supplied a few weeks later they blocked my transfer claiming there was a long running debt on the property.  I contacted them and they promised to look into the situation - I then got a bill and my transfer blocked again.  The next month they were virtually uncontactable, their customer services line rarely got me a live agent to start with, and at this point the only thing I could do was leave a message and hope they would call back.  A month later, my transfer was blocked for the third time.  I rang up, shouted at the customer service rep and threatened to get the Energy Ombudsman involved.  The result was that a week later they finally approved the transfer.  Avoid, their customer service is rubbish and understaffed.  They make money by offering bulk services to estate agencies and property management companies. Their rates are ludicrously high - easily 20% higher than the 'bg 6' they claim to beat.  Avoid Avoid Avoid.
3302|This company is horrible It is the worst experience with supplier in my life. they send us overbilled bills and they stopped us to switch to another supplier, they don't say the reason why they have some objective and all the time repeat that they call back!!!and never did. It is naightmare please if somebody can help me in some way I will be wait for any advice.
3303|Spark Energy are incredibly incompetent, they have lost 2 of our payments over the last 3 months and it has been up to me to prove that these have been paid!  They are very slow to return any complaints that you have and will not reimburse any of the costs incurred by myself after trying to sort their incompetencies!!  I would not recommend Spark Energy to anyone!
3304|If you can avoid this company then avoid, I've had so many problems!  I moved into a shared student flat, and we were told by our letting agent that Spark were the gas and elec suppliers (they had some sort of deal together).  We phoned them straight away and created the account.    1) After 5 months, we recieved several debt collection notices from another gas supplier.  It transpired that Spark took 2 months to transfer the gas supply and we owed the other company money.  We never knew of this as that company did not know who we were, and were very shocked when we called them up to sort it!  The second company were very polite and wrote off the amount, Spark denied it was their fault.  2) They grossly overestimated gas use.  We contested a gas bill showing 8000 kWh for dec/jan/feb compared to a bill from the previous year showing 4000 kWh for the same period (same tenants, bigger house, worse condition i.e. no insulation, and remarkably older inefficient boiler).  They agreed it was very high and would start checking the meter but instead they replaced it before anything could be proved.  The charges weren't replaced.  3) It's now a year and 4 months since we moved out, I just recieived a bill for GBP1,500 for that period!  I closed the account when we moved out.  I called and my case has been passed on to someone else, and i've not yet heard anything!  If you have to use Spark, keep a note of every communication and meter reading because you will need them!
3305|DO NOT USE THEM.  When I moved into my new house I contacted Spark and they said sorry we have received no details about you and can't help you so I decided not to transfer to them (gone back to NPower)however Spark took over both gas and electric anyway without my consent.  This is now been an ongoing issue for 2 months. They won't pass over the account to NPower, I can only ever speak to an overflow team who can NEVER help with a query, they never call you back and I asked to be put through to the complaints department but the overflow team said sorry that's not something I can do.  I have never had such bad cusotmer service in my life and would advise anyone to stay away from them like the plague.  Shame I have to give 1 star on overall rating and value for money as I would rather not give them any stars at all. 
3306|Spark Energy pays commission to letting agents who sign tenants up to them, it says so in the news archive on their website. The following link was working yesterday, but isn't today for some reason. http://www.sparkenergy.co.uk/news-archive/page-2-1111111111111.html   We are currently trying to get rid of them.   We've moved into our house, which we own, and are trying to change supplier. Spark keep blocking transfer, saying we owe them money. We don't, the former tenant and former owner do, and they're not getting a penny from us. Particularly as they are obscenely expensive (day rate on standard tariff is 23p per KwH). They reckon over a year we would use around GBP1090 a year just for electricity! Just to clarify, we live in a three-bed, not Buckingham Palace and our house is heated by gas.  We've now had it in writing that they will allow the transfer to new supplier next time it is requested (today) so we shall see. 
3307|terrible company never get involved with it!
3308|I cannot beleive this company. My partner and I moved into rented accomadation and were told we were using them. I said we weren't and went with EDF Energy - we still got bills from them. I thought we got it sorted (after numerous calls).  We moved out to our own property in March and just recently we have had calls from a debt collecting agency saying we owe them GBP250 (I don't think so). When they ask for our address we give it and because it's not the one they have they can't talk to us!! I have now emailed Spark (after 2 calls to get someone to call me back - ridiculous - how incompetent can a company be!
3309|Had the same problems as mentioned in most of the reviews on here.  My advice to anyone who has been forced to use spark to by their letting agents is to contact them an tell them about the problems you are having. I found that my agent could get in touch with spark a lot easier that i could and they let us move. Still waiting for our first and last bill though after 4 months.  After reading all the reviews on here, i will be contacting watchdog about this company.
3310|We fell for the same letting agent scam ie were told Spark energy were our supplier so passed over our details to sign up, however we were paying twice for our gas as Souther electric had been the provider.  We cancelled Spark to continue with Southern electric however they continued to take GBP50 per month direct debit.  We called to let them know over 6 weeks ago, had a final statement to say they owe us only GBP125 (we had paid them GBP250 altogether)and we are stil chasing them for the monmey back! 
3311|Not only in addition to all of the problems stated above, they are now forgetting to send bills some months and then demanding twice what the're due the following month. The main problem I have with them is that I suspect they are back-handing either my letting agent or landlord as the're in my rent agreement to have to use them.
3312|Before you rent a property, check that your energy supplier is not Spark. They tried to charge me GBP5,000 before I even moved in. It may take you about 6 months to change suppliers as they will try to charge you for previous tenants' electricity and block your transfer until that balance is cleared. It is also almost impossible for you to contact them presumably because their phone line is constantly overloaded with people trying to complain.  Anyone unfortunate enough to have to deal with them, should write to the Customer Resolutions team at the first sign of problems and when they invariably fail to deal with your complaint, refer the matter to the energy ombudsman.
3313|Awful company. I moved into a student shared house in September but in August, we received a bill from Spark for GBP102.06. We paid it as we were told it was just an estimate and we'd get it back. We then started receiving bills fro, Swalec. I called Trading Standards who said that Spark hadn't been supplying our house with energy since MARCH 2009. They basically sent a random bill they had no business sending. I have spent all week trying to get a refund, have now logged a formal complaint which has probably gone nowhere and have been told by Trading Standards (who are very helpful by the way!) that in eight weeks I can call the Energy Ombudsman if/ when I still haven't received my refund. Absolutely appalling company most definitely run by con artists. 'Angry' doesn't even cover how my housemates and I are feeling right now. The call handlers at Spark are very rude and don't even listen to what you're saying to them. They always say they'll call back within 48 hours and don't. My latest conversation with them ended up in the call handler pretty much hanging up on me. If you ever find that a house you've just moved to is supplied by Spark don't pay anything and cancel as soon as you can!
3314|I HAVE RATED OVERALL RATING AND VALUE FOR MONEY AS ONE STAR BUT ONLY BECAUSE I CAN NOT GIVE NONE.  One word, rubbish!  I rented a propery for 6 months 2 years ago and paid for the electric on a key meter.  Key meters mean you pay for your electricity as and when you use it topping up the key when you have used what you paid for.  I have had a call from a debt collecting agency telling me I owe them GBP130 for arrears.  I am not sure how this is possible when I was paying for my electricity as I was using it.  The debt collecting agency told me they were not legally ablidged to give me a print out of the account (which I asked for because I received absolutely no paperwork or chasing letters so wanted to know exactly what they were chasing for)so I called Spark 5 days ago to try to sort the issue out.  I was told I would get a call back within 48 hours.  48 hours later still no call back so I phoned again and was told I would get a call back within 48 hours.  48 hours later still no call back so I called again today and was told I would get a call back immediately after the lady in billing had spoken to her manager as she couldn't understand why I was being chased when I was on a key meter.  Two and a half hours later and a further 2 phone calls and still no call back.
3315|I am currently chasing Spark Energy for incorrectly taking GBP392 out of my bank account. After renting a property until 3/10/10 I received a final bill from Spark for a massive GBP392 after paying their recommended GBP30 direct debit for 6 months. This money was to be taken on 12/11/10 but before this date Spark passed the account to a debt collecting agency who cantacted me on 2/11/10! I paid the agency the money and phoned Spark to complain but no one returned my call. It seems when you call their customer service number you are told your complaint needs to be passed to customer services and someone will call you back. Then on 12/11/10 Spark took the GBP392 payment again from my account!! So far I've phoned 4 times to be told someone will return my call. No one has and to make matters worse my letting agency isn't releasing my deposit becasure they've not had my payment to Spark confirmed by them. Besided the very high cost of over GBP100 a month to heat a one bedroom small flat in the summer, Sparks poor service level has me currently GBP1,242 out of pocket including my deposit to the letting agency.  AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!!
3316|STAY AWAY FROM SPARK ENERGY!!!!Myself and my friend moved into a relatively small two bed apartment. We both work full time so were only in the flat in the evenings and weekends. Within a wekk or so after moving in, we received a final bill from Southern Electric. We received correspondance from Spark for our electricity supply asking us for Direct Debit details etc. We had no prior knowledge that we were changing suppliers and certainly didn't request it! After afew months of paying estimated bills (around GBP20 per month)we gave a meter reading. Whenever I called to speak with an actual agent it was increasingly difficult to get through. Waiting in queques for over 30 minutes at a time in some instances!!  When we gave the reading, the woman I spoke with advised that the units seemed incredibly high - comparative to that of a family of four using alot of energy!  We were landed with a bill of around GBP300-400!!! Two girls in a small apartment - how the hell did it amount to that!! I contested the bill. When I managed to get through I was asked to compile a diary of the electricity we used for a week. We recorded everything we used, i.e. the time the appliance was put on, turned off etc. I sent this into spark but NOTHING was done about it!! We agreed to set up a direct debit for GBP100 per month just to be rid of the bill - we were at the ends of our tethers and beleived there was no point in trying to take them on, They never called back when they promised, never answered emails or letters we sent!!We also received letters from debt recovery agencies for random amounts that we didnt owe!!   We moved out of the flat in Aug 2010 - we gave a final reading and were told that the bill would be a further GBP356!!! we continued to pay GBP100 per month. This month was due to be our final payment of around GBP56.  However, we never received a final bill! Plus, I received a text from a debt recovery agencey BCW saying we owed GBP366 to spark!!  I called Spark over and over again - was promised three call-backs but to no avail - surprise surprise!! I finally managed to speak with AN ACTUAL PERSON at spark and she was a manager. She promised me that the account was mixed up due to a new system they had implemented earlier this year. The manager promised me the final bill was around GBP56 and to that she would send me the final bill, cancel our account with BCW who had threatened to take me to court over a random amount.  I still havent received any letters or final bills - I don't know what to do!! Surely GBP600/700 between two girls is ridiculous!!! can anybody help, what course of action can I take? please help...I've paid out over GBP400 already...it seems so wrong!!!
3317|Good news for Spark Energy victims! Got caught up in the common Spark Energy / Letting agent trick - supply changed to Spark without any notification to us.  We get a bill from spark and 10 days later a letter arrives from debt collector, Chase solutions. Now the good news.....according to Consumer Direct, Spark did not follow the correct and necessary 'payment recovery pathway'.  Basically, they should send at least a reminder and a red letter before anyone else gets involved.  I informed Spark (bye bye chase solutions), gave correct reading, and am now waiting for bill to pay before moving to new supplier asap. Also, my letting agent did not follow correct procedures and I am holding them liable for any extra costs I face.  According to the Supply of Goods & Services Act 1982, reasonable care and skill should have been taken in notifying me (the tenant and bill payer) of the change of supplier.  Also,a reason for this change should have been supplied. Hope some this helps others in a similar situation.
3318|spark energy are the worste company i have ever been with . we left them in sept 2009 only to get our final bill in the form of a debtors letter! it was for 68 pounds. been with edf for a year now with no problems only on weds of last week to get another debtors letter from spark for GBP1338. we do not owe them any money ! but trying to explain this to the people involved is like trying to get blood from a stone ! they also try and bill you for the same units twice . something wants doing about these people!
3319|This has to be the worst company I have ever had to deal with.  According to them, bills are sent out around the 8th, at the same time, a debt collection agancy (Chase Solutions) is notified that if the bill isn't paid within 10 days to start proceedings. No account is taken of mail delays, lost letters etc. Spark Energy considers all their customers as bad payers without reason, can you believe the arrogance of these people? I already have had debt collectors knocking on my door chasing a bill I recieved 2 days later! Their customers should be their most important people, yet they treat them with contempt.  All their bills have grossly overestimated meter readings, even if you supply a meter reading, Spark Energy will ignore it. Don't waste your time.  They also falsify estimated meter readings, an estimated start meter reading I had was over 100 units less than the end meter reading for the previous bill, seems they can actually estimate a meter running backwards! So I am paying twice for these 100 or so units. This is bordering on theft!  And they managed all this in 3 months! They have left me no alternative but to change supplier.  This is the most incompetent, arrogant, inept, unhelpful, contemptuous group of individuals ever assembled under one roof. The sooner they go into receivership, the better!
3320|I wish to God I'd read these reviews before I signed up for Spark Energy. They have given me an experience which I would never wish on my worst enemy. They have pretty much made my life hell for the last six months. Firstly they charge very high prices. They promised to use renewable energy but didn't. When you try to get a final bill from them (e.g. to get your deposit back on your apartment) they ignore you, which can leave you hundreds of pounds out of pocket. Phone up their 'customer service' and you'll be very lucky if you get an answer. Their PR spin above about 'improving backroom services' can only be a joke. Leave a message on their answer phone and they won't phone you back. If you finally speak to someone they may promise to do something about it, then they do nothing. Again and again and again I tried, at my own time and expense, to get a simple bill from them. Nothing.  I think they can only be sitting on people's money who have paid over-the-odds, and they know it. And from what others here have said, if you owe them anything, they quickly threaten to send bailiffs round.  Please, please, please go nowhere near this shameful company.
3321|" A couple of years ago we too moved into a rented property and also made the mistake of saying OK to Spark Energy.  We didn't receive communication from them regarding our account and so tried calling them to cancel. We couldn't get through on the phone at all for weeks and when we did get through we told them we wanted to cancel and that we'd go back to our old supplier. Spark were fine with this and told us we didn't owe them any money as they understood that we had had very poor service. We were told that nothing was owed by two seperate people at Spark and one actually told us ""It will be as if we never existed"", we took that as the end even though a letter we asked for confirming this never arrived.  We were just glad to be rid of them to be honest and thought it as all finished. This was until a good while later we received a debt collection letter saying we owed spark money for the time we were with them. After querying this with Spark it was found to be a mistake and the debt was cancelled.  Today we received another letter from a debt collection agency saying we owe them over GBP97! I have again queried it with them and Spark confirmed on the phone that they could see the previous records and that nothing was owed but they have to pass it through to their investigation team. That's right, to investigate the fact we owe them nothing. I have also phoned the debt collection agency who are contacting Spark to find out what is going on.  Once they come back with their findings if they say we still owe them the GBP97 then we are going to have to decide whether to pay (something which we were told we didn't owe), or instruct a solicitor to deal with this for us.  I've never known such a shambles in my life."
3322|"Spark Energy are dreadful, not only are they expensive but incompetent. I asked them to increase what I was paying them monthly, which they didn't do, only to receive a bill for over GBP400 on a two bedroom flat. I left them almost immediately after that, and for almost a year now I have been waiting for a final bill despite sending an e-mail once a month, all I receive is - ""there has been a problem with our billing system and you are a priority."" What a joke. "
3323|Just to reiterate what others have said - this company are awful - I wouldnt stay with them if they were giving energy away free!! Completely uncontactable by telephone unless you want to wait 2 hours in a queue on a national rate number. Dont bother with the call back service either - they wont!! Even emails are ignored - its virtually impossible to leave them. DO NOT USE THEM!!!
3324|Three letters....OMG!!!!!!!!!! This is the worst company I have ever dealt with!!! Please I beg of people...do not use this useless company. I received a call from a debt collection agency saying we owe them some money from a bill over 10 months ago. However we received no such bill!!!! When I called they said no-one was available to speak to me (at 2pm on working day...how ridiculous is that) so I gave them my contact details so they will call me back. It will be intersting to see now if they do call me back after seeing the reviews on this page! I advise customers to never use this company as they will get nothing but hassle from them!  Useless and stupid Spark energy...you should close down! I am sure the directors and managers of this company know what is happening so they should do something about it. If I don't get justice I will take you to court!!! You sick, bad, no care in the world for anyone else people!!
3325|I reiterate others' thoughts.    Spark seem to issue bills, and threats, at random.  Like other tenants, I have paid them, only to be confronted with another, massive, bill that does not make sense.  In fact, the way Spark lays out its bills is confusing; I have challenged them, before, about this issue but have not had a satisfactory reply.  I am most willing, with help, to take Spark to the cleaners - anyone else up for that?    
3326|Spark electricity are incompetent fools. I wrote a letter of complaint on 07/02/2010 as I believed that they had over charged me by 269.56 pence. Of course there was no reply. I immediately changed service provider after waiting for over an hour to get through to the Spark electricity customer service line. I have had no contact from them since changing my provider but on  10/11/2010 I received a letter from a solicitor stating that I owed 862.72 pence. I was obviously flabergasted. This is the worse company in any spectrum of society that I have dealt with in my life.
3327|I think the below reviews arn't really representative of Spark Energy, they give the impression they're incompetent when in fact I maintain the use this as a deliberate tactic to extort money from customers and non-customers alike. I have never experienced anything like the kind of scams they tried, and continue to try 2 years later, to extort money from me.  To cut a long story short in Dec 08 I moved into a rented property and deliberately had the spark energy clause removed from my rental contract. I was supplied by British Gas throughout my 13 months in the property but during this period I was harrassed by debt collecting agencies despite me repeatedly stating I didn't have a contract and demanding to see documentation supporting their claim. It took the full year to get them off my back and finally in Nov 09 I recieved a letter from them stating they accepted their mistake, I never had a contract with them and I owed them nothing.  So end of the matter after a year of threats and grief? No! a month ago (Oct 10) I recieve a letter from a solicitors saying I owe Spark GBP2,200 and I need to pay immediately. I never had a contract and never recieved a bill from the fools! That level of incompetence is not a mistake, its deliberate harrassment in an attempt to extort money imho. Don't touch them with a barge pole.
3328|Worst company in the world. 30-40 minutes to answer the phone. Charging GBP140 a month in electric for a 1 bed flat without the central heating on!! Thats only occupied 4 days a week. Utter utter ar5eholes.
3329|"Also check out our Facebook Spark group. You'll find plenty of dissatisfied customers on there!  Search for ""Spark Energy: How much do you hate them?"" "
3330|Similar thing happened to me as written below. Moved in to rental, took several months to switch away from Spark, no final bill, debt collection agency contacted me yesterday etc etc. Have asked them to confirm in writing that the issue is now resolved. Nightmare.
3331|Re-iterating similar reviews, Spark are incompetent - billing is never correct, and are too eager to pass your details to debt-collection companies, even if you do not owe them anything, without making any attempt to contact you.  I have yet to have a satisfactory response to my complaints and hope that these reviews impact their income sufficiently to make them notice. Or collapse.
3332|Spark Energy seems incapable of communicating with me, on all fronts - either I am waiting for hours on the phone to talk to someone, only to get unclear information about my account (I have no idea how much I owe them, or vice versa currently) or if my direct debit amount is accurate, or if my meter readings are even doing anything. I would strongly advise against this company, and judging by previous reviews I am sure to get a nasty surprise when I move out in the form of a large bill. I honestly don't know how this company stays afloat.  Oh, and the blog link they have provided in the overview section leads to a non-existent page. Quality.
3333|Spark Energy are atrocious, don't even think of them as your energy supplier.  Like most people I came to them through the letting agency that I am renting the property through.  They were most unhelpful and rude from the outset, despite me giving them my full name they addressed all of my mail to my surname only - which I repeatedly told them was incredibly rude.  They over-estimated my bills, and while waiting for them to be corrected would set their debt recovery agents to harrassing me with letters and calls.  Then when I changed suppliers in disgust, something I achieved by threatening to get the energy ombudsman involved, they are continuing to send me bills - even though I have repeatedly told them they are not my supplier.  Appalling.
3334|We have been with Spark for exactly 157 days now. The overall impression is that you are better off with someone else. They overestimate you bills, the  customer service is hard to get through to (I have spent hours on the phone), when requested they will try to delay your transfer to another supplier for as long as possible (it took us some 3 months!) they are slow to get anything done.....  Regards  MK
3335|NONONONONONONONO  Do NOT use these people. They send an estimated bill montly, and then when you give them a customer reading they neglect to send you a replacement bill and pass your details straight onto a debt recovery agency, for the original estimated amount  They are charlatans and customer service is useless.  AVOID at all costs and do not even think about setting up a direct debit with them
3336|If they had a 0 on this option i give them below it! Took on a Spark Energy supply after it was forced onto me by my rental agency. I set up a direct debit to pay every month. Firstly they lost all my details and took 3 months to register and go live. Kept phoning for no replies. Rude representatives when they actually answer the phone! Left my flat 20th April 2010 and they owed me over GBP600 credit. Still trying to get them to pay me sixth months down the line. They seem quick to follow legal procedures for other customers.  Will be taking legal action as fed up of excuse after excuse and them avoiding my emails and phone calls. Dont ever sign up to Spark energy. Big regrets!!!! 
3337|I moved into my flat in March 2010, and I was told by my estate agent that my electricity would be supplied by Spark (I don't have gas in my property). For the first three months I didn't receive a bill from them at all, and then when I got it it seemed like they thought I was single-handedly powering a skyscraper from my one-bed basement flat! For a couple of months afterwards everything was smooth, and then they sent me a bill for GBP163 - for one month, during a heatwave. I paid the bill but made a complaint at that time, since then I have had letters from a debt collection agency telling me to pay-up bills which I had already paid. They tell me to pay the bills within a week of receiving them but the bills don't arrive on my doormat until almost two weeks after the date shown on the bill. The bill layout is confusing and hard-to-read.   Most recently I have tried to pay this month's bill by telephone (my usual method) and discovered that I am no longer able to do that. Their automated payments system no longer seems to exist except for online and as I only have access to the internet through my university library that's not practical for me at all.   Dreadful company, terrible customer service, extortionate charges - wish I could trasnfer but after reading the reviews on here it sounds even worse when you actually try to do that.
3338|Spark is the worst energy company I have ever dealt with. I think things would be OK if you were a normal customer, but I had an issue with my meter. It took over a year to rebill me correctly. Even when I moved out they had an IT collapse, took two months to give me my final bill which was over ten times the actual amount I owed them, and they promptly called in the debt collectors. The people are nice and sincere, but their systems are truly abysmal. I am wondering whether the nightmare of dealing with them will ever end....
3339|"After having my details forwdared to SE by my real estate agent they've taken over my new flat's electricity, without further authorization by me. Phone helpline has been unhelpful and rude. 1 day after that call I've received a letter from their debt collection agency for the bill from a few weeks ago (we've only lived here for a month and a half) demanding immediate payment, threatening to send around a ""representative"" to collect payment.  If I could give them 0 stars I would."
3340|This company are not incompetent, they are scamers. I am starting procedings against then through any outlet i can. Trading standards, the energy ombusdman, and considering legal action. Every post on here shows exactly what also happened to me, this is the way they work, it is deliberate. I hate to think of the number of vulnerable people they have scamed. We need to stop them trading.
3341|Poor customer service, and very disorganised. Rather than send me a final bill, they sent their debt collecting agency round (apparently it's common for the utility companies to get in bayliffs than to send off the final statement to their customers). The debt collecting agency were actually good and honest to me, unlike Spark. I would never recommend them!
3342|I have a massive problem on my hands! Spark Energy are saying that i owe them over GBP1000.  I am slightly confused as to how this has happened since i paid them the money they were due! I Find they are very unhelpful and very difficult to contact. leavng message after message to pay your bill over the phone.I was wondering if anyone else has had the same problem with this company.  I am now leaving the property in which spark energy supply both the gas and electric and fear that they will effect my credit rating if they continue with this charge which i am still not sure where they get the figure from.  I most certainly would not reccpmmend this company to anyone i know that i can be sure of. Your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated
3343|Terrible company - seem to overcharge drastically, never send bills (and those they do send contain next to no information about what/when you're paying for) but do send threatening debt-collection letters, customer services are pretty hopeless and paying them is awkward. Had to split up my electricity and gas because they never managed to take over the gas (despite repeated assurances). I put off switching for far too long, can't wait to be rid of them.
3344|"DO NOT USE SPARK ENERGY!  After moving into a new house supplied by Spark, they blocked my attempt to switch to British Gas with constant delay tactics. They were unable to tell me how much I owed and refused to issue a final bill. Instead they kept sending wildly inaccurate estimates and then hired debt collectors to threaten me, when all I wanted to do was to pay the final bill and switch. I wanted to pay them, but all they seemed able to do was to issue threats.  Their customer service team kept no record of my closing meter readings and I had to chase half a dozen times (providing multiple sets of ever-increasing ""final"" readings) before I made any progress.  It eventually took 6 months and a complaint to the Energy Ombudsman before they told me how much I owed so that I could pay and switch supplier. I have changed energy supplier several times in the past and it has never been so difficult and long-winded as leaving Spark.  They are without a doubt the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. They were incompetent, rude and heavy-handed. I would not recommend them to anyone."
3345|If you are thinking of changing to this company don't. If you are with them get out asap. They are a complete nightmare. We bought a flat that had them as an existing supplier. We looked at the internet and saw the dire warnings so decided to change. They have attempted to block us at every turn. You wait ages for them to answer the phone.They won't phone you back. the come up with ridiculous figures for bills even when you give them a meter reading. They are expensive unless you agree to a direct debit and it takes them weeks to acknowledge payments made via Paypal. The latest is a letter from some heavy debt collection agency from Warrington, which they claim to be the second (never got the first) threatening dire consequences unless you contact them to discuss your non-payment. They then admit that Spark do not have the staff to deal with their finances! Avoid them like the plague. You have been warned.
3346|I will aggree with ppl here that we cannot refer to even worst enemies!seriously its a damn **** company..I am so irritated by their service that I want ppl to know how big scamsters these ppl are.I will prefer spending time at home in darkness but not use spark energy. Want to give -10 but have to rate!  If you try their customer service nobody picks up and if they pick up they are not well informed.They sent me a bill of 850 pounds for 7 months and have made up the reading.I called and sent them correct reading still the bill is inaccurate.I dont understand what their billing team does?Why do they lie so much and make up to fool people like this.Guys beware never ever go near them or refer them..they will rip u off totally...they r xtremely expensive and say they r the cheapest available on earth!Well I am shifting soon and will never ever use spark..Pls spread the word to your dear ones and friends about this professional cheats and liars. 
3347|I have found myself in a nightmare situation with this company bills randomly appearing and demands and threats - denial of payments having been sent billing the house twice in my name and the occupier.  A complete lack of transperancy in the billing   Complete chaos when you can get through to the company you finish your call believing its sorted out and with in days another menacing letter arrives.  You cant get rid of them they refuse to transfer etc  As I say nightmare - avoid like the plague.   
3348|AVOID, like the plague. I did not get a statement in over 2 years, despite requests and written complaints from me, which were ignored. Meanwhile they had pushed their charges up massively, but because I had no statements I didn't know this and carried on paying a direct debit which was way too low, subsequently finding myself owing them GBP2,300 when I moved house. The initial request for this sum was followed obscenely quickly by a threatening letter from a debt collecting agency!
3349|the worst company, worse than you can ever imagine! unbelievable how bad they are, they sound nice on the phone but lie, lie, lie. never call back. I can't even get a bill from them i left my last flat on 17th june, it is now 20th Sep. Managers say they will call back - they don't. I have just tried to call them again, my call was hung up after 1hr, no one spoke to me. incredibly angry!!!!!!!
3350|Please do not go anywhere near this horrible company.  Back in 2008 they sent me a bill stating there were 14 days to pay.  After less than 7 days they sent a strongly worded letter stating that if I didn't pay immediatley they would start proceedings via a debt collector.  That letter arrived on a Friday and on the following Monday I recived a letter from the debt collector!!  Still well within the original 14 day payment window.  Of course you can't get through to their customer services phone number as it just racks up money for them while you wait ... and wait.  If you leave a message they don't get back to you.  I was one of the lucky ones by the sounds of it and managed to transfer away from them to npower.  It has taken them until now (i.e. over a year!!!) to send me a proper final bill with meter readings on.  As usual after only a few days the phonecalls from another debt collection company started, even though I have paid the bill via online banking direct to Spark.  The debt collectors were aggressively suggesting I should be paying them as the debt had been outstanding since March 2009.  However it has taken since March 2009 for Spark to actually send me a bill so certainly not my fault.  It states in their complaints procedure that they are firm believers in learning from customer complaint experiences so they aren't repeated.  Well they haven't learnt at all and are still disgusting their customers with the use of aggressive and improper tactics concerning bill payments.  A thoroughly nasty company that you should AVOID.
3351|Spark Energy  I move into a property in June 2010 looking to move supplier. I thought british gas was bad but this company is on a whole different level.  I have tried to move supplier on several occasions and they keep objecting.  My payments were/are up to date and they still won't allow me to leave.  As it stands now I can't contact them as their so called customer service number goes through to a technology centre.  They have sent me incorrect bills with wrong meter readings, along with this a bill seems to have combined on my account from a property I have never lived at.  They are not available via email or over the phone and all the reviews tell me how bad this company is.  I have never experienced such pitiful service and behaviour from a company.  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!
3352|AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!, if possible I would give them 0 out of 5, horrific energy company, constantly overcharges, unable to contact, refuse acknowledgement of payment, call debt collectors within merely a few days of sending a bill, in the past we have received a debt collectors letter before the actual bill, do not use, if your letting company has set up with them prior to your moving in switch asap!
3353|I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.  Spark are currently trying to bill me for over GBP1,000 worth of gas supplies despite the fact they have NEVER supplied us with gas.  We have our electricity through them but NOT for much longer - as soon as I can change suppliers I will.  Useless excuse for a company. 
3354|Very poor service on every level. They over charge, make up meter readings, send multiple bills for varying amounts (seemingly at random) and are generally appaulingly setup to deal with issues & complaints, not to mention are the most expensive energy supplier I've ever used. All the hallmarks of a scam company - avoid like the plague
3355|I recently moved into a new flat and found that it is supplied by Spark (letting agent told me I would be going with them). Having read some of the reviews was obviously worried to start off with but over the past 2 months can honestly say that I have received better service from these guys than any of the companies I have been with before. Their staff seemed to be a bit more bothered than that of british gas anyway, they are clueless - 40 minute conversations, giving me 4 different phone numbers, no one could help, staff were totally rude to me. Never again. The guys at spark were actually friendly and felt like they actually wanted to help. I had a problem with my bill and they sorted it out for me minus the attitude that BG used to give me! Nice to actually have a company that does what they says they are going to for once!!
3356|"Don't even both with them. Absolutely rubbish.  We paid bills and they would send us reminders, and then threatening letters, saying we better pay up. Not that they'd ever answer the phone to sort it out. They didn't send us a bill for 9 months (after constantly saying they would next month when they updated their systems), and then sent them all at once and demanded it be paid quickly.  The amount of arguments we've had with them on the phone is a joke, as is the amount on phone bills ringing them (they never call back). Everything ""isn't their problem"".  Then we tried to switch to NPower and they blocked the transfer. We used NPower for gas and Spark Energy for electricity. NPower perfect; Spark the worse."
3357|Do not go with this energy company, unless you want to receieve poor service for your money throughout your contract. I was forced to take my electric through Spark Energy by my letting agent, after 18months of being overcharged I cancelled my account and moved to a new company. I have had to wait over 9 weeks so far for a refund which i have chased 5 times by phone and once by a complaint which wasnt acknowledged. I am still waiting for my refund and have been told at least another 2 weeks before it is returned. Three months to cut ties is not acceptable. This company has no interest in the customer or providing good customer service, the call centre is staffed rude and unhelpful consultants who will say anything to fob you off. Be warned you will regret getting involved with this cheap company.
3358|Oh Dear,  I wish i had read these reviews before i switched to Spark Energy. I would not recommend them to my friends, perhaps i would even consider not recommending them to my enemies either!  Upon closing my account I received a final bill and then a month later a bill for one days useage of electricity at a cost of GBP10.77!!!  Mmmm note to nice lady in customer service.. please put the phone in the cradle before you call me a rude little *****
3359|My letting agent had used these as the default suppliers. Immediately switched to British Gas upon moving in. Sparks have been nothing but trouble since. They blocked the switch on no less than 3 occasions. When finally it did go through after much shouting down the phone they sent me a final bill for GBP350! I'd been in the property 3 months and already paid them GBP90. The final reading they gave was 1900 units higher than the actual reading including 1843 units in 6 days according to the bill.   2 months later and after many phone calls they are still sending me this final bill! They have tried to lay the blame at British Gas's door. Constantly inform me it will be sorted out but send me the same bill 2 weeks later.  Shocking service. Can never reach them and have to wait 20 mins on an 0845 number to fix THEIR mistakes. Absolutely atrocious company. Refuse to accept that 2 months after the switch over date my meter is still 1000 units below their final bill reading!!!!
3360|My letting agent transfered my supply to sparkenergy ever since i have had nothing but problems with them.1)never been sent a bill.2)contacted them at least 5 times to give new meter reading. they claim they never received.3)contacted another supplier to take over,sparkenegy objected to my transfer in March but denied this and told me i can leave4)Sparkenergy have since objected to my move 4 time and in May told me it was because i owed them money, I paid them what i owe and they said i can leave them now.5) they objected again and sent me out a made up bill saying i owe them more money with a totaly made up meter readings.6) contacted them again in JUNE after talking to consumerdirect, they said they will sort it out in the next 7days, nothing was sorted out and they just sent debt collecters around from 2 different companies for different amounts of money that i do not owe them, threats of trading standards and ofgem don't work and ive had to get a lawyer. BEWARE!!! CONSUMERDIRECT 08454 04 05 06         
3361|spark energy is a big con.....never pick ur phone or call  back....never return ur messages or anything.....poor customer services and expensive.....never use them.....
3362|Sparks is the most disgraceful and crooked electrical company. I would advise all parents of students staying in rented accommodation to be aware of sparks crooked and immoral cheating students out of their money. They are an easy target because Sparks runs unfair agreements with property agents and uses this to take over and supply over priced electricity to students without their permission or knowledge. When Sparks does not get its own way it employs underhand debt collectors to do theit dirty work too. Once again I warn all parents of new students to watch out for this most underhand of suppliers. I was forced to give a rating of 1 star to enter this review but in reality I would not award even 1 star!! 
3363|"I wish I  could give them a negative star rating!!  Having read all the reviews of spark energy on this website, I'm glad to see I'm not alone! And not in the least surprised that I am not.  Having decided to move to First Direct due to increasing bills from spark and having to argue with their incompetent call centre staff over discounts i was entitled too, i received yet another ""final"" bill that was incorrect.  I spent weeks emailing their service centre and calling them to be passed from one stupid member of staff to another with the more excellent range of excuses why I had been over-billed and not been sent a refund!  I finally wrote to the energy ombudsman (http://www.energy-ombudsman.org.uk/) who repeatedly chased them. Spark even didn't comply with the conclusions of the ombudsman with the required 28 days and needed another letter to them.  I have eventually; today over 9 months since i left them, received a cheque for over a thousand pounds of over charging and GBP100 compensation from spark.  I would recommend as many people as possible complain to the energy ombudsman about this woefully poor company.   "
3364|I am currently a customer of Spark. They increased my Direct Debit by an extortionate amount and then have point blank failed (despite chasing and promises) to send me a cheeque refund. The call centre is not very helpful. Having just tried to change suppliers, Spark has blocked it. Here goes with another round of phoning them up to sort the matter out. STAY AWAY FROM THEM! I wish there had been customer reviews before I signed up. Lesson learned!
3365|This company is rubbish.  My Gas and Electric was taken over by them after moving into new rented accommodation and I had no idea why.  Now I understand why.  I have been trying to get away from them since they first took over and have been having no ends of problems with them keep rejecting my new (old) energy company from taking me over.  I checked out the Facebook page from the person who posted a few posts down and also found another site using Google (sparkenergy.org.uk) so can see that I am not alone.  Seeing this review site shows what a poor company they are, trading standards should investigate them (and shut them down).  My advice for anybody else is stay away from them (if you get the chance)!
3366|theyre happy to take your money, then deny all knowledge of it, even when sending them hard proof of cheque numbers & bank details of when it was physically paid into their accounts. to get a bill out of them is impossible. the staff from the departments looking into your account cannot & will not communicate with you, directly or indirectly. my home was connected with them when i moved in, however am now looking to swiftly change. I will never return to them, & would not recommend them to anyone. the debt collector they have passed me onto, irrespective of my bill being up to date, is impossible to contact. my biggest regret is not changing from them to a reputable energy supplier when i moved in.
3367|Started renting flat in December 2009 and Spark Energy was the recommended utilities company by my letting agent, I was paying GBP105 per month by direct debit for a 1 bedroom flat, once I checked the tariff I realised I was paying too much and contacted them, so far I have paid well over GBP600 in gas and electricity combined, after working out what I should have been charged I am due a refund of GBP500 at least, trying to get Spark Energy to give you a breakdown and a bill is impossible, I would not recommend Spark Energy as no-one will contact you and they will not send you a bill.  Checked on U-switch site and they calculated how much I should be paying so my calculations are correct.
3368|"SPARK ENERGY = THE WORST ELECTRICITY COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!  They wiped my account of virtually every payment I had made and then demand payment of over GBP700, they also send out bills demanding payment within 7 days but it takes 7 days for the bill to arrive, they then immediately pass your details onto a debt collection agency but never inform them that you have actually paid!  I then tried to leave but they ""objected"" and now i'm blocked. I then spent over two hours on hold trying to speak to someone about this, was cut off at the hour mark and had to start all over again only to be told the reason it took so long was because of people like me holding up the phone lines!!!!  AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!"
3369|Spark Energy are by far the most terrible company that we have ever had dealings with.  We were forced into using them by our letting agents at the time, but did not receive a bill throughout the duration of our 7 month tenancy.  We then received a bill 6 months later, demanding payment in 7 days!  We paid the bill in full, naively thinking that would be an end to it.  However, we are now being threatened by their debt collection agency, despite numerous phone calls to Spark who have confirmed payment.  An absolute joke of a company - please, please do not get involved with Spark Energy!
3370|steer very clear! It seems Spark energy use a company called ludlow thompson (a letting agent) to force people to sign up to them (often without choice), and then fabricate bills that are extortionate (and cannot be justified)- even if you do send them meter readings. AWFUL customer service also, you cannot get hold of them, neither will they explain why the bills are so awfully high. I will be switching as soon as I can get the customer service team to answer my phone call.
3371|Expensive and unresponsive. They hijacked my electricity supply after being passed my details by my letting agent. Despite never being given a meter reading before switching they conveniently used an 'estimated' (i.e. fabricated) reading. They ignored a letter of complaint which I sent by recorded post and it's almost impossible to get through to their call centre. It took 3 months to return to British Gas.   If you move into a new rented property please do not agree to be supplied by Spark. You are free to choose your energy supplier and it is illegal for your letting agent to insist otherwise.
3372|Stay away from SPARKENERGY at all costs!!!!! My letting agent transfered my supply to sparkenergy ever since i have had nothing but problems with them.1)never been sent a bill.2)contacted them at least 5 times to give new meter reading. they claim they never received.3)contacted another supplier to take over,sparkenegy objected to my transfer in March but denied this and told me i can leave4)Sparkenergy have since objected to my move 4 time and in May told me it was because i owed them money, I paid them what i owe and they said i can leave them now.5) they objected again and sent me out a made up bill saying i owe them more money with a totaly made up meter readings.6) contacted them again in JUNE after talking to consumerdirect, they said they will sort it out in the next 7days, they said this before,ive now been sent to letters from different debt collection agencies demanding different amounts of money despite that fact i do not owe them anything, i now have to get a lawyer!! CONSUMERDIRECT 08454 04 05 06
3373|Same as all the other reviews ... Transferred to Spark by the letting agent, have been trying to transfer to another company since I moved in in April without success as Spark keep rejecting the transfer requests without any real explanation. Their first bill to me post mark 20th June and their first threatening letter from their collection agency 28th June!! I was on holiday for 10 days from 20-30th June, paid off the bill in full on 1st July only to get another letter threatening to take me to court on 6th July! Avoid this company at all costs!!
3374|Terrible service from Spark energy, numerous complaints unanswered, phone backs never received, no bills turned up but spark passed my detailsonto a debt collecting firm - hard to pay a bill unless it's issued wouldn't you say.I'm fed up with Spark and all their PR. have set upa facebook group called SPARK Energy customer disservice, feel free to join and share bad experiences... maybe we can prevent others being subjected to their poor excuse of a company.http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=129150843791821 
3375|I didn't want to give any stars!!!!!  We were made to go with this useless company by our letting agent when we took a tenancy (I guess they get a kick back for doing so). However, I have had nothing but bad experience and shocking customer service. Their internal departments don't communicate with each other and I have had to chase them to (a) set up my account so they could take my money (which took 3 months); (b) sort out transferring my gas service (which took 3 months as well); and (c) being billed for money I didn't owe, being told by Spark that I did not owe them the money (twice) and then getting harassed by a debt collection agency for this money because their billing department did not seem to get the message from the customer service people I was speaking too. I am moving my business elsewhere - DO NOT USE SPARK.
3376|Spark Energy is a sham!  Do not use!!!!
3377|SPARK ENERGY  PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!    The rating should be zero stars, but unfortunately you cannot give this.  I have been on the phone to this cowboy company multiple times this week still without luck.  They have basically gone ahead and taken over my gas and electricty without my consent.  im trying to get to the bottom of it.  The very first phonecall I had back in April when I moved into the flat was to say that they were the preferred supplier by the letting agency (whom didnt tell me this) But i did say that I didnt want them to provide the utilities back at the start, in saying this they have gone ahead and done it anyway.  I have Scottish Power set up to take over from the original company (npower) on June 15 and now im really not sure what to do - can anyone help?  ive spend so much time on the phone to this company and they are very unhelpful,  and really dont take no for an answer. 
3378|DO NOT USE SPARK ENERGY, my letting agent gave them our details and they called us told me i had no choice i had to go with them. I did not want to go with them as my house was already with British Gas, but still they said i had no choice. I called my letting agent and they said i did have a choice. They took over from Britsh Gas which i was not happy about. I have since then arranged to go back to British Gas but keep getting letters saying they cant take over as Spark Energy are objecting. I have called Spark 3 times now and all those times they have needed meter readings! Said they will send us our final bill so we can transfer to British Gas but still no letter! I am fuming and do not know what to do!!
3379|I thought i was the only one suffering at the hands of this highly incompetent and totally lacking in customer service company that takes so long to respond to your contact that seems like a ploy to wear you down that you give up.  My experiences whilst a short term tennant at one of the houses managed by this pathetic organisation is the same as all the others. we did not get a bill and when we finally got through got one that did not give me a breakdown of how this was made up, the DD was set up late so we have to pay over inflated charges and then got threatening letters from their collection company.  Spark abdicated their responsibilities and have taken more than six months to tell me in a letter a few days ago they are not prepared to change their position on anything i have complained about.  Ombudsman next but pls pls pls all of you avoid them at all costs and complain complain complain by e-mail incessantly - at least it ties them down in having to answer at some point. The one star rating is too generous for this company.  
3380|Spark Energy took 6 months to provide me with a final bill for the house I rented, and then demanded payment within 7 days.  To add insult to injury, the bill it totally made up. It is completely different from previous bills and guess what, is 5 times the price. They have even made up the meter readings.  What a bunch of fakers. Unsurprisingly they make no response at all to complaints. Luckily I have only one week left before my 8 weeks elapses since my complaint so I can get the ombudsman involved. Let's hope they are better at resolving things.
3381|Spark energy - WHAT A JOKE!!!!!!!!!! my letting agent pass my details to them to take over my supply, I recieve a call and an email requesting my DD details, I give them, then hear NOTHING untill i get an email telling me that my DD had been set up and would start in a few days, but I think, hang on, you havnt even told me you are now supplying me my electric, and have had no meter readings!! I try calling them, and their phone systems are down, I eventually get hold of them to find out what is going on (my DD has now been taken) and i find they DO NOT EVEN SUPPLY MY ELECTRIC!!! I am still waiting on the refund of the money they took and shouldnt have done DO NOT USE THIS COWBOY COMPANY - they have zero idea of how to run a business!!!!!!!!!!
3382|I've just been reading some of the reviews and I've had the same experience. Me and my 3 flatmates were put on Spark Energy through our letting agency. We moved in in August and by March I hadn't seen a bill. I'd been phoning them since December and all they kept saying was we'll have it sorted out in 2 weeks. Then they're estimated bill was GBP4000! when i finally got a semi decent bill (for gas still waiting on electricity) I got a letter saying I hadn't paid even though I have. Just been on hold for 20mins before giving up. An absolute joke! I am a student and this is the first time I've lived away from home so this is completely stressing me out!
3383|Spark energy..? avoid at all cost, 100% totally incompetant. After 8 months we had to ,on a daily basis nag them for a bill, we had gas & elecricity with spark so we knew it was just a matter of time before we were ambushed with a massive bill, it did come & 5 days later we had collection companys calling us at work & sending rafts of threatening letters demanding payment for a hugely inflated bill which was estimated from the previous tennants, try contacting Sparks customer services then you get a good insight into what a Mickey mouse company they are, i'm suprised ther still trading, we are switching to British Gas, Spark Energy have totally stressed us out...... a pure joke.
3384|Absolutely shocking. Been waiting for my bill since September.  Do not ever use this pathetic excuse for a company.
3385|I don't want to give them even one star, minus 5 stars would be better, they are a complete understaffed scam.  They have been nothing but problems and I am still waiting to get a bill so I can transfer back to British Gas.  I eventually managed just to give them a reading, get a balance and pay over the phone to enable BG to reclaim the account.  I presume letting agents are recommeding them as they get a commission, this is wrong. I have been trying to make this happen for 3 months and I think I ma getting there now, but it may still take another month yet! 
3386|My daughter is having exactly the same problems as outlined here by other contributors. She moved into a let house with another girl back in August 2009 and despite many phone calls etc she is still waioting for a bill. The other girl has also now gone travelling so like Lucy we are desparate to get this sorted sooner rather than later.  I rang Spark today and they confirmed that they hoped that their meter dept and IT dept would be able to work togather to get bills out soon - although wouldn't say whether one week, one month, or one year! The only consolation I have is that I have another number for them so you don't have to pay 0845 rates - it is 01750 726394.  
3387|I have been with spark energy for over 6months not threw my choice!threw that of my letting agent. every time i try to pay a bill i phone them at least 6 times and end up being on the phone for over 20mins! which is costing me more money than the stupidly high bill i receive. i received a threatning letter telling me they would install a meter to which i was to pay the cost. the joke is i hadn't got my bill! i got my bill a week later. i phone customer services 3 times, each time i was told someone would phone me back, 4 weeks and still waiting. saw the website so you can log into your account on-line another joke you can't set up an account! this company should not be able to opperate they are a bag of c**p Has anyone else had the same hassle?
3388|Spark Energy has to be the most incompetent company in the whole country, never mind the energy sector.   I have experienced nothing but problems: high prices, lack of bills, incorrect bills, no customer service response...the list goes on. I have received threatening letters stating they are going to cut off my supply (even though I am no longer a customer).   I strongly advise anyone to stay clear of them as they have nothing good going for them.   Simply one one: terrible.   
3389|Just don't do it to yourself - read the rest of the reviews here - 'nuff said.
3390|Like Lucy Naylor and so many others my step son is having terrible trouble getting a bill from Spark, when they did send one it was for at least twice the amount his previous energy company were charging.  We contacted them time & time again and agreed to pay monthly from the date of the larger bill, while still querying how a single lad in a tiny one bed house run up electricity bills of over GBP90 a month!  He doesn't cook or have the heating on!!! He doesn't use a washing machine (he brings it home!) They were quick enough to cash a cheque we sent them but they still ignored the letter that was with the cheque and are still demanding over GBP800.  They said there was a problem with his meter and could he do some recordings of meter readings over a week or so and then return the forms which he did , still nothing...They are absolutly useless and I think we have better things to do with our life then keep persuing someone to pay them money - so I say stuff them!! (Would like to say something stronger) I have a whole case file ready for the day they want to take him to court for non payment, meanwhile he will be looking for a new energy supplier, it will NOT be SPARK!
3391|"Here is an email I have just sent to Spark Energy due to their TERRIBLE and frustrating service.... Dear Whoever it may concern,   I would like to officially complain about the terrible customer service I have received over and over again from Spark Energy for the past six months.  As of July 19, 2009 I switched to Spark Energy to provide my electricity supply and since then I still have not received a single bill.  I have been told time and time again that this is because you are waiting for information from some kind of engineer (or something) but surely six months is an unacceptable amount of time to have to wait for this information on both my part and Spark Energy's part.  However, at the beginning of my enquiries on receiving a bill I was not told this and it wasn't until maybe November that this came to light, or at least when I was told.  I was told numerous times this would be sorted very soon and that someone would get back to me by email or phone with an update of what was going on - I have not once been contacted regarding this.  Later in November I began to make many more phone calls as my housemate was due to move out and the only way she would give me money towards the electricity was if she saw a bill.  I explained this time and time again to different people but still nothing came of it.  I began to ring daily as I was frantic to get a bill before she left but not one person seemed to help me in any way and I was often on the receiving end of some very rude individuals being told ""what do you want me to do?!""  I asked to speak to managers that were ALWAYS too busy.  I asked if they could call me and left details (knowing they were already on the system) but to no avail. The last phone call I made around that time I spoke to a very nice guy who told me he will sort it all out for me and would get a bill to me by the end of the working week (a Friday).  However, once again nothing came of this.  Subsequently my housemate has now moved out (and gone traveling) which leaves me having to foot the bill myself (when it finally comes that is).  I then gave up......  Until, I received a request for an up to date meter reading on January 5, 2010.  Being asked for this I thought I may then receive a bill.  I then rang customer services to give the reading and explained my situation but again was told there is nothing that can be done.  I left a meter reading (not for the first time) and requested some kind of approximated bill (not for the first time) only to be told this also cannot be done - not in the most polite of ways either.    Almost six months now and I still have not received any kind of bill.  I asked again to speak to a manager and was told very coldly he was busy.  So once again I requested he call me back.  In the mean time I rang customer services again to find out how to complain, which is how I got this email address.  To my surprise Raymond Lightfoot called me back the same night and seemed very helpful and sympathetic agreeing that it should not have taken this long to get as far as speaking to a manager but could not explain anything else (is there nobody with any answers?!).  He told me to leave it with him and he will get a bill sent out with me the next day as he will be able to sort a few things out with some other people.  I received an email from him the next day saying the manager involved is in meetings all day so he won't be able to get anything to me until the day after that.  I was very happy with the progress and so replied to Raymond saying thank you and that I appreciated it.....and that is the last I have heard from Spark Energy - another empty/false promise from yourselves!  So, six months worth of electricity still to pay for - that is going to be a lot of money!  A lot of money that I could and should have been able to pay in intervals every month or even every quarter.  I am now in your debt but have no idea how much debt and to be honest it is really unacceptable.  If you had sent me a bill and I hadn't paid for six months what would be your protocol?  Reminder after reminder - debt collector letters - power cut?  Whatever the protocol I am pretty sure you wouldn't allow it and something would be quickly done to sort the issue - so why treat one of your customers any differently??  Why should I allow you to force me into your debt?  There should never have been a need for this.  And now I am not sure how I will be able to afford it.  All I have ever wanted to do is pay for the electricity I have used.  I'm sure there are many customers who would be glad not to receive a bill, I however have been chasing you for far too long.  I have missed out on contributions towards electricity from my ex housemate because of Spark Energy, I have had higher phone bills because of Spark Energy, I am now in debt (an anonymous debt) because of Spark Energy, I have been spoken down to because of Spark Energy, I have wasted time, energy and stress because of Spark Energy and all because you appear to be too incompetent to produce an electricity bill!!    What I now want to know is; what are you going to do about it and whether I will receive any kind of compensation for your very poor customer service and communication skills.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you,   Lucy Naylor                      "
3392|"My son began renting a flat about a year ago and was told by the estate agent that they had set up an account in his name with Spark Energy. He had not requested this and he wanted an alternative supplier and phoned Spark to say this. They appeared to have agreed to the switch but a year later and countless phone calls later he is still receiving increasingly expensive bills from them. The company that he would like to transfer to say that they cannot do anything until they send the paperwork. He feels that whenever he phones the person on the other end is using various tactics to delay the process such as ""sorry I can't hear you clearly, could you please ring back later?"" "
3393|my tenancy agreement stated that we have to use spark as our supplier and i didnt mind as i heard they were cheap. yer right. for 42 days of gas and electric ive had over 300 pounds taken from my account. the first payment of over 150 came out 9 days after them taking over. they have had to be sent 3 meter readings by post and a couple over the phone they said they havent recieved them when i did manage to get through to them .i worked out that the previous supplier b gas charged me less than half that for over 2 months of gas and ele. 
3394|Just avoid them. Agents will try and sign you up when letting a property - especially the duplicitious lot at Ludlow Thompson. Make sure the first thing you do when you hear from them is phone to say they do not have permission to supply your home, that you have confirmed this with your landlord and that you have instructed the current supplier not to accept a transfer request from them.  I found they gave up at that point.  Even better tell letting agents you won't accept a contract that includes them - it is almost always the agents that get the commission.
3395|If you have lots of time on your hand and you don't mind to spend a lot of it on the phone every month sorting out problems, if it doesn't bother you that your current bill includs previous paid for bill and that effectively you are paying twice the bill and if you enjoy receiving letters from debt recovering agencies every month (even though you have paid) the definitely go for this supplier. 
3396|This horrendous company took over my energy supply without my consent,posssibly by giving my landlord a commision!.Then when I received my bill and I questioned who gave them permission to supply my energy and why has my bill become 300% more expensive they did not reply but passed my details onto a debt recovery agency to collect GBP90 after already taking GBP500 direct debit(southern electic charged less than GBP200).I am refusing to pay this untill I see a copy of the contract I did not sign.The only good part was the speed that southern Electric took over from Spark,my advice would be avoid this company at all costs or if you are with them find a reputable company that can take over your supply immedeatly.
3397|One word for Spark Energy - Incompetent.  My account was in debit GBP200 which I duly paid.  4 days later they took, without my permission, GBP345 out of my bank account then sent an invoice stating I had yet another outstanding balance of GBP229!  In the space of 2 weeks have I paid GBP782 in addition to my monthly DD (now cancelled).  No point talking to their customer service staff, if you do actually manage to get through as they are completely useless.  Furthermore, I am still waiting on a refund from December 2008 when they helped themselves to money from my bank account.
3398|Great customer service. I had a problem with my gas bill this month so I phoned customer services at Spark Energy to find out what it was. I was a little nervous that I had under paid but in fact the person I spoke to sorted out the problem straight away, they were really great. Phew, thanks Spark!
3399|Spark Energy Gas & Electricity are utterly hopeless. If their call centre is busy the call cuts off. Its an 0845 number so youre still paying for it.They tried to increase my direct debit payment from GBP30 to GBP230 without ever reading the meter. When I called to query this the person I spoke with said my electricity wasnt even with them. I had to get a manager to resolve this. Thankfully he was better than the person I got before.On trying to leave, having given them a forwarding address twice, they insisted on sending the final bill to the property. In my experience an utterly hopeless company
3400|Spark Energy - I moved into a property and was told i had to use Spark Energy.  I was contacted on the day i moved in (enough hassle moving let alone having to talk to them!) and 3 of their representatives then phoned me to set up my direct debit and account and each time the one previous had lost the details on their system (very good when you are giving your bank details!)  I then received 6 welcome packs in the post...one would have been enough, and then discount the rest off my huge bill!!! I have since closed the account with them, and have 6 different bills sent to me all with different prices, and estimated readings dispite the fact i have mailed them and called them numerous times with my readings.  They then employed a debt collection agency to chase my payment which they had at yet another amount!  They have yet to respond to any of my complaint letters.  Hugely expensive with no cutomer service skills.
3401|Having had a quick look at the reviews already submitted, I was considering not writing one myself about spark energy gas and electricity. However, upon seeing that they had an overall rating of 0.9/5 I could not leave without saying my piece. Shortly after completing this review I am sending them an email threatening court action.Here is a summary of my few short months with Spark.In May I moved into a new home spark provided energy for. I gave them initial readings and set a direct debt up for GBP100 total. I also contacted Npower to take over the supply.  On the 24th of May Npower took the electric. I gave my final reading and paid my balance as the direct debit had not come from my account yet. I also cancelled my direct debit as they agreed I could follow the same plan with the gas takeover (just pay on the final reading as would only be approx 4 weeks gas supply).Spark then blocked the gas takeover (but didn't tell me, Npower did) When challenged why they said it should not have been blocked and to get Npower to try again. I then received a letter saying they had changed my direct debit amount to GBP155.62 per month (they only supply my gas and for about a month) I called and cancelled the direct debit on the grounds it was very unrealistic. They blocked the Gas takeover again. This time because I had not provided a second reading. I pointed out I had been with them less than a month and didn't feel it was normal to have to do this every 3 weeks. Even so I gave a reading and paid the amount owed. Npower would have to now wait two weeks before re-applying to take over the gas.In June I happened to notice GBP155.62 was taken from my account. Even though I was totally up to date except 1 weeks gas. As you can imagine I phoned straight away. They tried to convince me I had asked them to set the direct debit up again (this is untrue, I would have to be completely mad to do that) I told them to keep GBP55.62 in my account in credit and refund the rest. They agreed and said it would take 2 weeks. 8 weeks later  My gas is finally with Npower. I have not received a refund, or a genuine apology for the situation. Despite over 5 phone calls.I will now proceed this through the courts and if they recieve a CCJ... It's the least I can do for them.This company are unreliable, have no idea what customer service is and will block takeovers from other suppliers (and you will try to leave spark I promise you). The worst thing though, is the illegal removal of money from my account without permission.Avoid them at all costs. Yes they are cheaper on paper, but I would rather pay 5 times their rates to just receive a reasonable service.I can not work out how to give ZERO STARS :(
3402|Moved to Spark Energy in July 2008, for my gas and electricity utilities, as they seemed one of the more reasonbaly priced suppliers at the time.  Within 2 months they had incresed my monthly payments by GBP30!  Each quarter I have to hound them to submit an account so that I can keep an eye on what is actually being used (I have sent numerous readings for bills to be rendered), but almost inevitably they fail to respond.  I decided to move from them this July and sent readings with the request that they send a final account... again I was ignored.  Meanwhile my alternative choice of supplier said that Spark was blocking my transfer until the outstanding balance was cleared ... no problem if they would only just send me an account to pay!!  Last week I received a statement of my account and noted that although the electricity bill was rendered to my readings, the gas account was not and reflected a considerably higher estimated usage than had actually occurred ... strange really, as both my gas and electricity readings were submitted on the same email .... selective sight perhaps?  The accounts administrator I spoke with then attempted to 're-rate' the account (having been provided with the correct reading during the conversation at least twice, slowly and clearly) and announced that the outstanding balance had INCREASED ... it's not rocket science ... a lower reading should deliver a lower outstanding balance.  She then went on to say that there was a dispute about my start reading for my gas supply .... so why had this not been brought to myattention in the preceeding 12 months???  It was obviously far too difficult for this girl to understand the basic of mathematics and she gave up, saying that she would pass it to the billing department to deal .... and there the conversation ended.  I've endured some appalling levels of customer service in my time (& I'm only in my 40s), but none match the subterranean levels of Spark Energy.  They once even sent me an email, at the bottom of which were the account and contact details of another customer ... the Data Proetcttion Act plainly means nothing to Spark either.  My advice .... to keep your sanity and reduce your chances of a stroke (or worse) don't touch Spark energy with a barge-pole!  I've now written to them (Recorded Dlelivery) in the hope that this will be resolved before I have to take it any higher .... because, believe me, I will.
3403|refreshing change from all these stupid rude companies that constantly ignore you or feed you loads of rubbish when they do reply or just make something up because they can't be bothered to sit and look at your query. Scottish power claimed i used  GBP60.00 in one week i am a single person in a small one bedroom flat and work all day long so i'd love to know what used the  GBP60.... i changed to spark 2 months ago and they are the best energy company i have been with yet, their staff have never been rude, only helpful, even phoned me back to make sure i didn't need any other help
3404|where do i begin...stay away from spark!!! firstly our letting agent in our old house bound us to sign up to spark...we did unfortunately for us and have been paying for it ever since. firstly we have never ever had a bill, secondly there are never any managers available to speak to so goodness knows what they would do in the case of a fire or threat on the building! Managers never return your phone calls, when you leave them, the pursue you to come back, when they finally work out after the court battle what you apparently owe them you have no notification just a very rude lady on behalf of spark leaving voice mail messages on your mobile at all hours demanding that you phone her urgently to repay the debt...staff refuse to provide their surnames, a must according to telephone standards, if they dont do this they are liable to pay compensation. if i had known our experience with spark would have been this stressful, upsetting and scary, i would never have let the house in the first place. 
3405|I signed up to a 6 month tenancy and the letting agent informed me that their preferred supplier was Spark energy. I said i'd be interested to hear what they offered but nothing else. I didnt sign anything and nothing is mentioned in my tenancy agreement. This was December 2008. By February 2009, Spark Energy had taken my supply from British gas. They had my full details and my direct debit details and took 2 months of DD. I cancelled this and since then i have been in telephone and email contact but to no avail, more and more innaccurate bills arrive and i dont pay. They make no sense and no one can give me an answer. I have now written my final formal complaint and will forward this to the Energy Ombudsan. 
3406|never returned phone callsnever came to check reading I had to chase Spark Energy Gas & Electricity to pay for the bills and the guy on the phone started got mad at me because the bills were not paid!!!!!Terrible customer service
3407|"***BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY***This company, based in the Scottish Borders and headquartered in Edinburgh, specialises in dealing with property letting agents.The agent is paid a commission for signing up tenants, often without either the tenant's or landlord's prior permission or even knowledge.The agent is then paid a further commission if the property gas & electricity supply remains with Spark for a full 12 months.This is almost certainly detrimental to the bill payer; both tenant and landlord, as their tarriffs for dual supply are almost 30% higher than the likes of Scottish Power for the same (no fixed charge based) dual supply.In my case, my tenant was signed up by the agent, without prior knowledge or consent, and subsequent bills were around 75% higher than I was paying. - No tarriff rises were involved over the comparable periods.On conclusion of the tenancy, when I was finally aware of what had happened, Spark claimed they had acted ""in good faith"".This is as may be, however their trading policies as they stand are objectionable from 2 major standpoints:      1. They do not provide information on their tarriffs to the actual bill payer.2. They do not provide a detailed breakdown of the unit costs on any kind of statement to the actual bill payer.- As a result, there is no possibility of a consumer being able to compare and control energy costs. "
3408|stay away !!!! the worst customer service i have ever had , no bills recieved then when i did they were estimated after giving meter readings , and now they tell me they have not been supplying my gas and utilita have , my advice is stay away from spark energy im taking professional advice on there incompetence !!!
3409|Spark energy harassed myself for weeks demanding for us to change our electricity to themselves. We finally agreed because our letting agent had given them ALL of our details and we were fed up, it seemed cheaper so we agreed. However, our letting agent gave them the wrong meter number so we ended paying for 2 months worth of our neighbours electricity. We found this out when we had been paying our electricity to Npower all along. We tried to leave and switch our neighbour back to her original supplier (BG) but to no avail. After many many phone calls to them telling them to switch everyone back we get debt collection agencies sending threatening letters.We contact citizens advice and sent Spark a letter telling them the problems and ordering them to fix it. We finally get our money back and the debt collectors off our back and we were told it would all be sorted. We have just had a bill from them demanding  GBP367 from us. We are with Npower and had been told that our neighbour would be switched back! She is an elderly woman and we are students. 
3410|The Spark Energy Gas & Electricity call centre are the most friendly and helpful I've come across plus I received a free cinema pass with my statement.Had a tough time getting through at first but not a problem any longer.The most personal service I've ever had and seem to have improved on being able to get through to the call centre.
3411|When I moved into a new rented house, the letting agency bound me to switch to Spark for gas & electricity saying they are cheaper and the letting agency is moving all properties with them over to spark.I was pretty happy with npower but thought to go ahead with spark. Little did I know.Firstly they took a lot of time and many phone calls to complete the switchover. Then they sent me wrong bills on three occasions. One of the bill was only for a period of 10 days and the amount was over  GBP80 for my small one bedroom flat. I had paid over  GBP80 through monthly direct debit but there was no mention of that amount on the bill. Where did my money go?I find it takes a lot of time to connect to a customer service person on their line. I kept a record and my average waiting time before I hear a human voice was 20min.I chased them over phone several times, every time i got the answer that the bill is sent in error and a new bill will be produced. But then nothing changed and they then passed over the case to Recovery Agents, some of who were rude and started to send me threatening letters.Now I have decided to move it over to the court with legal action on Spark Energy. I have also filed a written complaint to the letting agency for what I feel is misguiding the tenants.From my experience I understood, they are very poor, I would switch to any top 6 energy companies and at least your complaints are heard by the respective companies or the watchdog agencies.
3412|Here's my struggles with Spark Energy Gas & Electricity. So far: No details, no contract, no bills (10 months and 3 meter readings given), no answer to phone, no response to emails, no response to snail mail, no response to answerphone threats of regulator, 40% increase in monthly direct debit.
3413|"There's a good reason to stay with one on the Big Six energy companies, they are monitored and complaints made about them do appear in the press,  also ""official"" complaints that are made again them are taken seriously. After the appalling service that I have received from Spark Energy and the fact that none of the government watchdogs services have spark energy on their books means that my future suppliers will defiantly be one of the Big Six. "
3414|We agreed as a business to let them take a look at the prices of our enegery so we could save money so at first they were still slightly pushy however they were friendly and it was sales so thats what we expected. However; We then kept recieving calls off another person who gave us the price and wanted us to sign up for 5 years there and then and we of course said no as it was a long term contract and we werent happy to sign it just because he wanted to when he couldnt give us a breakdown or any form of proof that we were saving any money. We said to him we would think about it if it was for two years however he was adamant that he was not able to do it, so we said no. He soon phoned back saying that he was able to do it for two years but we needed to sign the contract imediatley and he was becoming so rude due to my manager being in an important meeting so she was unable to sign the paperwork at the click of his fingers. He was ringing back every 15 minutes to see if she was out of the meeting even after i had said i will get her to ring as soon as she had finished. It got to the point where he was telling me to interupt the meeting to tell her he was on the phone and then when i told him i was unable to do this he asked for direct contact with the director of the company. I am unable to give out details like that but he was insistant on getting hold of them. After about 6 phone calls someone else rang from the same company trying to get hold of my manager who was in the meeting.Don't use them unless you like being mithered.  
3415|annoying cold caller who didn't want to sell me anything ha ha I work from my home 
3416|"Received numerous unsolicited calls from Utility Wise.  During the last call I decided to talk to the agent, he attempted to tell me he wasn't an energy broker, did not want to sell me something I already had (i.e. Elec and Gas), and only wanted to help with Energy saving consultancy.  When challenged about the legitimacy of his claims he was adamant the call was ""not a sales call"".  He then went on to attempt to gather info from me (number of sites/meter points/number of employees on site etc etc) and then asked me if we use a broker for energy supply...!!! at this point I mentioned our telephone numbers are TPC registered. He closed the call very abruptly - he also didn't want to answer my questions about his 'sales tactics' and where/who to address my complaint within Utility Wise. "
3417|Really helpful when providing me with prices as my current supply was about to end.All queries I have had have been answered with speed and all to a satisfactory conclusion.The best thing I liked about using utility wise is that you have your own contact and any problems you have they will sort it out on your behalf. No waiting in phone queues with your provider.
3418|My bills have actually GONE UP BY GBP400+ EACH MONTH. I HADNT ANY IDEA UNTIL I SAW MY FIRST DIRECT DEBIT PAYMENT.  I haven't  received a statement of terms or any paperwork and I have tried to find out why I am now paying more for my electricity but no-one will call me back.  My gas bill is even more confusing with bills and then credit notes. I have supplied them with all the necessary information to investigate at their end but I'm STILL WAITING. Ahhhhhhh. Do not I repeat do not use Utilitywise unless you enjoy frustration, confusion and have hours to wait sitting by the phone for the call you were promised but never receive. 
3419|I have always found my contact at Utilitywise to be very helpful with no request for help going unanswered. From the initial contact to the setting up of the contracts and the follow up service, the whole experience has been second to none. Having Utilitywise look after the energy requirements for the site has taken a weight off my shoulders.
3420|The number of times these people keep calling and harassing us is just unbelievablel we've actually started keeping a log so we can put in a claim against them.In the beginning two years ago I told them we are in a serviced office and have no need for their service, yet every 3-4 weeks we get two calls, one after another from different people.Getting really fed up of it, and need to start reporting them... Since the government isn't doing anything about these cold calling firms I've no choice but to post how terrible they are in every site I can find.
3421|Utilitywise were great for our sports club in coming up with prices for new electricity & gas contracts. However when asked for help in dealing with account problems with British Gas (which they had originally set up for us), or in finding a provider with non-standard terms, the silence from them was deafening!
3422|I was struggling setting up a new electric supplier for my business, being blocked at every turn by the supplier the previous tenant had used. Thankfully l found the Utilitywise services on the web and was contacted shortly after. Despite the continued difficulties, Joe Wilson from Utilitywise contacted me almost daily to reassure me all would be well and not to worry. This allowed me to focus on getting my business ready to start trading. He finally secured a supplier for me offering favourable rate to save the business money. He will also provide continued support to ensure that l receive the best possible service dealing with the energy company on my behalf. I am extremely grateful for a his hard work, and the peace of mind l have been given. I would not hesitate in recommending this first class service. Many thanks x
3423|Always helpful with any problems Simon Avocet Trust
3424|Our contact kept in touch with us regulary throughout the review period. We were always aware of how the market was moving.  Once the decision was made to renew with Utilitywise the process was very quick and easy.

3429|The excellent service and help, provided by the advisor in switching our electricity supplier. He took his time to ensure that all our needs were covered and provided us with regular updates as to the progress. It was always of the highest standard. I would recommend him to friends and family.
3430|this is a great way of getting your electricity sorted out for the most saveing on what you pay,not haveing to worry and spend time hunting ,phoneing around.All i had to do was answer a few questions put the phone down wait for a call and it was all sorted brilliant its the second time they have helped me in the last 4 years would reccommened it any time.they ask questions about the tarrif how much you pay and make you understand what price you get it for now and what saving you will make when you start a new contract,they let you choose how many years and how you want to pay.they ring you once sorted with all your details you just sit back and they do the rest.  
3431|As promised Utilitywise came back promptly with good prices and a hassle free contract to sign, all in all very good.
3432|We are very happy with the service we received from the Sales Consultant, he was very helpful and informative keeping us informed at every step and most of all getting us the best deal possible. Would definitely recommend.
3433|Consultant was very helpful and clear on all points, follow up calls and emails to make sure everything was running smoothly. Great deal and the packages along with the electricity itself will come in very handy in the continued electricity cost reduction.   
3434|"I am very happy with the service I have received from Utilitywise. My consultant was friendly informative and very helpful without being ""pushy"" and took care of the process of changing our energy suppliers whilst keeping me infomed before, during and most importantly afterwards ensuring all our needs were met. I would highly recommend."
3435|The advisor has been very great and helpful to keep us upto date with developments over costs and has helped us keep our costs as low as possible in a very turbulent market, which as a charity is very important to us. Whenever we speak he is always keen to help us and get us the best deal possible. He was great and not pushy at all in his selling. He explained everything in detail and the best was I didn't have to do anything to find a cheaper supplier. I would recommend Utility Wise.

3437|I am very happy with the service and savings I have received from using Utilitywise.The Sales Consultant that was dealing with our company was efficient, friendly and answered all my questions.
3438|Wayne Corby contacted us and was very efficient with his information and found us an excellent deal. He was great and not pushy at all in his selling.  He explained everything in detail and the best was I didn't have to do anything to find a cheaper supplier.  I would recommend Utility Wise.
3439|what a great service plenty of follow up calls and kept informed every step of the way
3440|Straight-forward, helpful and effective service from Utilitywise. Utilitywise took away all the complications of sourcing a new energy contract and ensured that we were guaranteed the best rates for the longest time period possible. The customer service we received from their adviser was first rate, and he kept me updated and well-informed throughout. I would definitely recommend them to any business who needs to renew their energy supplier in the near future. Nik North Shields Fish Quay
3441|I received a more than satisfactory service from Utility Wise.  All the information I needed to make an informed decision was presented promptly and clearly. The transfer process has been simple and we will save money. Persistence definitely paid off on this occasion.   
3442|Operative was very attentive and provided good service getting the best deal he could pleasant to talk to and easy to understand. Would recommend his services. Always returned calls when he said he would and was very patient with waiting for a response from us.
3443|Wayne Corby contacted us and was very efficient with his information and found us an excellent price fixed for one year with no daily standing charge.  He was pleasant without being over the top in his selling manner.
3444|We run a small business and have struggled in the past with being drawn into expensive automatic renewals from our previous energy providers. When we got in touch with Utility Wise the service was excellent - they were very helpful in explaining all of our options, came back to us extremely quickly and handled everything efficiently and with great customer care. It was a huge weight off our shoulders and we really felt we had trusted in the right people. I would recommend them to everyone.
3445|I have used Utility Wise for over five years, they are quick, efficient and get the job done.  I am pleased to use just one company and know we are getting value for money.  The electricity market is a minefield of sellers and who is offering the best price therefore it is convenient to use just one company and know you are getting the best price.
3446|I run a charity on a very limited budget. Every little helps. We use a lot of electricity because of the nature of the organisation.  We have now got a great deal which will save us money.  It was all dealt with very professionally and much quicker and easier than I expected.  Very impressed.   I expected to have to sign lots of documents and bureaucracy but it was very simple and smooth
3447|Victoria Collier has been a great help with our utility bills especially with Scottish Power with whom we have a large credit and Victoria has managed to negotiate a reduction in our direct debit payments.  She keeps us up to date on all that she is doing, is very friendly and approachable a credit to Utilitywise.
3448|We have dealt with Utilitywise on a few occasions now. The staff are friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable. We signed a 2 year fixed rate Electricity plan with a sizable reduction in prices compared to our previous plan. This was also compared to the suppliers own quote for electricity supply. The mind boggles at the prices Utilitywise charge and what the supplier want you to pay. Great service, highly recommended.
3449|He gave 110% and nothing was to much trouble. Definatly reconmmend utilitywise if all there empoyees are so helpful.
3450|Wayne Corby helped me sort out new contracts for our two businesses and I couldn't be happier with the service. He was very friendly and helpful on the phone and switching over has been a doddle. I would definitively recommend Utility Wise to others looking for a good deal and great customer service.  
3451|Great a real person that can help you with all your needs, no more pressing this or that on the telephone then being put on hold for ever.The srevice thoughtout was excellent, helpfull in all area's and listened to our request's and needs with the satifaction that the same person will be there at all times should it be needed.Overall there is nothing bad about the service Utility Wise offer's.  
3452|remarkablein this day and age to be able to speak to the same person throughout the proceedure, however many calls it needed, so much easier and quicker
3453|As a small club affilliated to the Royal British Legion,reducing running costs has been of paramount importance to ensure the clubs survival.Utility costs represented between 6% and 7% of our running cost and contnued to rise annually. With the advice and suport of Victoria Collier and her team I can now project an acurate forcast of expenditure over 3 years and the savings are significant ensuring the clubs survival.The Royal British Legion have been in contact with me regarding utility costs and were impressed with the overall contract supplied by Utility Wise. I have made further arrangements for future utility contracts to be transfered to Utility Wise through the advice and support of Victoria Collier.
3454|A very professional service. Prompt actions taken and good advice received from friendly staff. Vicky Collier in particular has provided a competent service.
3455|An e-mail from and a resulting telephone conversation with Victoria Collier was timely. As a church we were paying way over the odds for our electric supply, we couldn't have carried on as we were. Victoria got us a brilliant deal with a new supplier and we now have affordable electricity bills. Not only that but now I'm relieved of the hassle of seeing to it all, it's all done by Utility Wise, any problems an e-mail to Victoria and it's sorted. Well pleased!
3456|In the initial stages was a bid sceptical of UtilityWise, however after allowing them to deal with our provider and review our energy costs which in turn saved us money, We would have no hesitation in recommending them to our friends. 
3457|We have had an extremely positive experience of using Utilitywise . The knowledge of the process and cost impacts has been excellent. Finding a much better energy plan has taken all of two days and a few phone calls. 
3458|For some time we have been worried about the cost of the Church's gas and electricity but have had limited time to investigate the options.  Utilitywise stepped forward asked for details of our current supplier and our usage and within a few days came up with some recommendations on prices for the next 5 years.The communication was good and was backed up in writing.  
3459|the service I got was very beneficial to my business and I received a good deal which helped my business and I would have no hesitation to recommend to business colleages and friends, the staff member was very helpful and I will certainly use utility wise in the future 
3460|"We have used Utilitywise for a number of years now and have always found them very helpful, friendly and informative. The person who we dealt with very recently was very well spoken, polite and very effiecient with his service. I would always recommend the services of Utilitywise to fellow business owners for not only savings but peace of mind that your energy supply is being dealt with in a professional manner. Energy is one of those things you put off looking into as it is a ""minefield"", but the guys at Utilitywise know their stuff and always keep you informed and updated."
3461|Wayne Corby has been very helpful supplying prices for gas and electricity contracts. He called back when promised and kept us informed of the prices available. He has helped with the change over process and monitored our accounts to ensure everything is in order
3462|Wayne Corby has been very helpful supplying prices for gas and electricity contracts.  He called back when promised and kept us informed of the prices available.  He has helped with the change over process and monitored our accounts to ensure everything is in order.  He has taken the time to understand our company and help with the various properties we manage.    
3463|We were contacted by an advisor of Utility Wise in May of this year (2014). He was extremely personable and gave us a very succinct overview of the service that Utility Wise could provide. We were given adequate time to digest the information and decided to go ahead with the no-obligation account profiling (a process whereby Utility Wise gather the necessary information to be in a position to make informed recommendations). He duly came back to us with an attractive long term fixed rate deal which we decided to take. All the paperwork was handled by Utility Wise and the process was completely free of charge, convenient and uncomplicated. I would therefore have no hesitation in recommending Utility Wise's services.
3464|Everything was highly commendable. Everything was explained  fully and clearly and I was given the opportunity to make comments or ask questions. Most professional. Would recommend to associates.
3465|Jayne Robson of Utilitywise was engaged and authorised to act as a service provider on our business account.I found her to be very friendly, helpful and efficient with dealing with my phone call.E mails came through and my request was dealt with promptly and the matter completed within a day.
3466|We were contacted by UtilityWise and I am glad I was in a good mood that day and didn't shrug them off. This may have had something to do with How nice the gentleman was on the phone. He was very up-beat and positive. He made me feel reassured that utilitywise would handle our very difficult and confusing utility accounts. I left it with them and they made everything much easier and now I am no longer stressed about any of it. Thanks Utilitywise.
3467|Was more efficient that previously, necessary paperwork kept down to a minimum.  Calls returned when agreed and prompt service.Would use this service again.
3468|One of your consultants contacted me nearly a year ago to offer help in cutting down our gas & electricity bills. After patiently waiting and keeping us informed about the market etc. throughout what proved to be a very eventful year, we finally went ahead and he managed to find us a very competitive fixed rate, which, due to the deteriorating situation in Russia/Ukraine, seems like as good an idea now as it did then. Implementation was easy and we did not have to speak to our previous provider at all as UW took care of everything. Would thoroughly recommend.
3469|I was contacted by an advisor who was friendly and efficiant and hepled with all questions i had and resulted in finding the best deals for 3 of our sites. keep up the good service Michelle Kirk
3470|"When I started my company I received countless phone calls from questionable people calling themselves things like ""The Electricity Registration Commission"" and started treating such phone calls with suspicion. I responded with equal hesitancy when I received a call from Utility Wise. Their rep was politely persistent and gave an impression of legitimacy. After looking into the company I began cooperating with them. The relationship removed an unnecessary burden from my shoulders and all interactions with the company have been professional and amicable. The consultant was very knowledgeable and insisted that I contact him if I had any questions. It's very useful to have someone in the know at the other end of the phone and when I contacted him with some questions a couple of months later he was a great help. There is also an aftercare package which was unexpected and they seem to take a real interest in providing a complete and quality service."
3471|Our Head office used Utility Wise and so I was encouraged to do the same. The service I received was excellent. The Customer Service advisor was very cheerful and happy to explain everything very clearly to me and the switching needed very little work on my behalf which was exactly what I wanted as I was very snowed under with work at the time.
3472|I have recently dealt with Utility Wise with regards to my small business. The help I received was second to non and I would very definitely recommend the company to friends and family. Excellent customer service and a very smooth and easy transition, plus a huge saving on my utility bills. Thank you utility wise :)
3473|Utiltywise has helped our small business save money, which is obviously wonderful! However, it was the professionalism, great communication and friendly approach that really impressed me. I was contacted at a time that suited me and my lifestyle, which made dealing with things so much easier. My account manager kept me informed of exactly what was needed and when, and he sorted the rest, hassle free. I have already recommended them to friends. I have their number saved and would have no reservations about dealing with them again. The information sent out was factual, not full of jargon, and my office is now covered in the energy saving stickers supplied!! A pleasure to deal with, which is refreshing!
3474|We needed to change our energy supplier and unfortunately I was the nominated person to handle this. I actually thought that it would be difficult and time consuming and my nominated Account Manager, Jonathon found it increasing difficult to get direct contact with me, and when he did it wasn't easy to get the information he needed from me, but he didn't give up, but he didn't pester me either. Each time he contacted me he just asked for a small piece of information until he eventually got what he needed in order to finalise the changeover. In between he investigated the reason why the previous transition to a new supplier didn't happen, and he did this without any help or support from me. He was very patient and understood that I really wasn't making this my priority due to my work pressures, but it had to be done and he did it! We are now on a better tariff and obviously paying less. Jonathon did a great job and wasn't pushy or annoying, just really very helpful. He also explained how we can also use the facilities of Utilitywise to help us meet our aspects and impacts of ISO 14001 - saving energy. Thank you.
3475|All representatives are more than helpful. I can give any one of them a call and they are more than happy to help or a message would be passed on to the person looking after the account.
3476|My wife and I found very helpful and efficient staff - very courteous to us both on the phone and provided a great service.  We both would recommendUtilityWise.
3477|We have 5 of electricity meters and all of them where due in different periods. Utility wise managed to renew our contracts so they finish now at the same time and is all free.
3478|Jayne Robson was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with and got me a competitive rate. Very pleased with the service.
3479|Utility Wise appear to have arranged for us a very long term gas and electricity rate at a fixed rate for the next 6 years that is lower than our previous rate.  Hopefully this will stand us in good stead to beat any eventual market price increases. Friendly and courteous staff made them a pleasure to deal with.
3480|Friendly, efficient and informative service received again this year. No 'pestering' calls or annoyances, just a smooth service in dealing with what turned out to be a renewal and will not hesitate to deal with my account manager again next year.
3481|What a wonderful service we have received from our consultant. with his help we have received over 6K refund. This was a great boost to enhance our services for our disabled service users. we are a charity and our consultant helped us cut costs on both our gas and electric bills.
3482|Friendly, efficient and informative service received again this year. No 'pestering' calls or annoyances, just a smooth service in dealing with what turned out to be a renewal and will not hesitate to deal with my account manager again next year.
3483|A pleasure to deal with, friendly and efficient staff. My account manager made moving premises so much easier by sorting out my energy supply. I definitely recommend Utilitywise and will not hesitate to use again in the future.
3484|Working with our direct energy consultant has been an absolute pleasure during our time with Utilitywise. He has always been available to us at any time in helping us sort out our numerous energy contracts. His ability to fully understand our needs and liaise with the energy suppliers directly has given us one less headache to deal with as all matters are undertaken directly by him. We're very pleased with the prompt and efficient service Utilitywise has provided us and have enjoyed working with him to help us deal with any issues and also explore money saving opportunities.
3485|Very helpful and knowledgable person  really impressed with her 
3486|Utilitywise has enabled 2 of the businesses I work for in a consultancy position to focus their time more effectively and save money short and long term. This year with the assistance of utilitywise we locked our prices in at a competitive level which overall means no official price rises for 3 years. Overall our business has driven efficiency with the aid of utilitywise's knowledge, expertise and products and reduced our energy usage in terms of kwh's with the total standing at 54% saving in one year and we have the focus to reduce this further in the next 2 years with utilitywise's partnership. I highly recommend utilitywise as a business partner. 
3487|We have used Utilitwise for many years, this year particularly was a lot of work for them as we changed suppier and had some major issues with this, one meter had not been invoiced for over 3 years although every quarter the meter was read. Supplier would or could not recognise the third meter!  Everything got sorted in the end,  our new supplier can manage our three meters.  As I said a lot of work and was always kept informed of progress.  A very happy client.
3488|We engaged with Utility wise about three years ago and they now source our Gas and Electricity for both our Factory in Leeds and our Company house.Great service, everyone I've dealt with has been helpful and answered any questions I might have. They save me having to shop around and remind me when contract are ready for re-negotiation.They've also been competitive against other agents and suppliers direct.
3489|After carefully looking into the company I decided to give it a chance! I am glad I did as everything was sorted in a few days! My water, gas and electric is all been looked at and I have a account manager I can trust . I wish the company every success in the future. Rudolf Gole 
3490|"AVOID THIS ORGANISATION!!! We are a registered charity and were recently contacted by Utilitywise. We had well researched our pricing at our contract set up in January this year and they acknowledged we had a very good existing contract but said prices were going up and we should secure a price now for our contract renewal in January 2015. They came up with pricing which was only marginally increasing our unit price and they made a big thing of that. They showed the quote for both unit price and standing charge without reference to GBP signage as 10.67 and 1.97 respectively, implying they were both the same basis. After challenge they admitted the standing charge was GBP1.97 per day, a significant increase on our current 27p per day. This was dismissed as being a ""...small part of your overall bill..."". As our monthly usage is circa GBP100 an additional GBP52 per month on our bill is far from minimal. When this was pointed out the salesman tried to recall his emails (his quote and confirmation of the daily charge having been by email). AVOID."
3491|Excellent company and staff.  Right approach in every field.  Used company for a few years and would definitely recommend them.Very efficient and friendly staff, always ready to serve and assist with any queries you may have.No hesitation in using them again.
3492|When they first contacted me I couldn't believe what she was telling me and thought it was a scam! However, I checked out the Utilitywise website and when she contacted me again I gave her the information that would provide me with a repayment of just under GBP4,200 from our electricity provider for overpaid vat and CCL within less than 10 days of our first contact. He has also contacted our gas provider and hopes for a similar outcome. We have an engineer coming out to survey our premises to carry out an energy audit next week so this will, hopefully, save us more money. I am delighted with the work that he has carried out on my behalf and would recommend her highly to anyone else.
3493|EXCELLENT SERVICE, FRIENDLY AND EFFICIENT STAFF, GOOD FOLLOW UP SERVICE NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL
3494|When I heard that our Director was considering using Utilitywise, I must admit I was apprehensive as I knew nothing about the company, and I then found myself inheriting the work and dealing with the energy consultant direct.It is a delight to be able to communicate with someone who radiates enthusiasm and has great people skills.  The transfer of our utilities was a very easy process and was dealt with with great respect and patience throughout.   All credit to our energy consultant.Altogether a great, efficient and rewarding experience - would thoroughly recommend Utilitywise to friends and colleagues.
3495|very good service - efficient and fast. gave me all the options
3496|Representative was very friendly and explained everything in detail. Always called back when he said he would. This is the second time I have used utilitywise and would do so again.
3497|Such friendly and professional customer service! They were always quick to answer questions and found us a great deal! Many Thanks 
3498|staff were very patient, very clear with the information and most importantly we got a price decrease for the next year
3499|he was good and explaning how it works and price was better than dual energy, i would recommeded to friend or any other businessthe only down fall was he could not email the prices i told him to wite the peice and email he said he can not do it is has to be from the company.we are happy and we have gone through with it 
3500|i was very pleased with all the help i received and the savings that the masonic lodge will make and will certainly recommend this company to others 
3501|Our organisation has had a number of problems in recent years with its suppliers and contractors, but UtilityWise is definitely NOT one of them.  Their customer service is second to none - I never have to call them because there's never any problems, in fact they call me to ask if there's any problems or if there's anything they can do to help further and they're definitely on the ball in being pro-active towards its customers; not only did UtilityWise negotiate an excellent deal for us back in 2012 but they have already negotiated a pre-contract end deal with our current supplier - another excellent deal for us when our current tie-in period runs out in 2016.  Wish I had this service from my residential supplier.
3502|Decent advice and hopefully would lead to our company saving money
3503|I found the staff at Utility Wise to be helpful, patient, competent and professional.The smallest detail was not too much trouble and the deal we have, as a business, looks terrific
3504|The advisor helped me out with a tricky gas standing charge issue on-going for a couple of months. At last a satisfactory result.
3505|Dealing with Utilitywise was easy all round.Took the hard work out of comaprisons and saved money.
3506|Staff has organized all the paperwork very fast and hassle free, got advice on how to get better deal from my current supplier plus managed beat the quote, if any questions , they are straight on phone explaining and helping.
3507|Fast and friendly service. Efficient, and they have saved us lots of money.
3508|I was approached by Utility wise to see if they could look after my energy supplies. They found me some cracking deals, my gas fixed until 2019 with NO standing charge.Electricity fixed for 2 years at a time. Well worth a try, you have nothing to loose but a lot to gain.
3509|Searching for cheaper prices for multiple meters and services was made so much easier using Utilitywise, saved hours of frustration and a great deal of money!
3510|Great service. Takes all of the hassle out of commercial utility review. Simple and efficient. Utilitywise do all the legwork. Just sit back and save money.
3511|I decided to review our utility contracts and had not much luck myself.  I invited 2 companies to look at this for me - one local company who came to visit me and Utility-wise.  I have to say, I prefer the phone way of handling this and don't see the point in face to face meetings - in this situation.The local company gave up at the 1st hurdle and Utility-wise kept on with the challenge.They were very persistent, but this turned out to be a good thing - at first it felt as though it was high pressure, but actually turned out that it just needed some answers to move forward.We had 2 separate contracts and Utility wise were able to help with one - as the other was still contracted, they still did their best to re-negotiate the deal - They did this for us, but we still had to stay direct with that one supplier - This was a benefit to us, but not Utility wise as the contract was not organised officially by them.All in all a very good experience and I really wasn't expecting that!
3512|I obtained a good deal for our gas and electricity contracts via Utility Wise three years ago. The contract is up for renewal and Utility Wise contacted me in plenty of time to negotiate new contracts. They did all the work. I trust these guys and would recommend them to other organisations. They do all the work. The contact person was clearly experienced and knew the market. It was a win win situation- will definitely stay with them. 
3513|we having problems with  the current electric supplier for last 4 yeas (over charge, invoices missing ext..)after dealing with utility wise they managed to sort out the over charged bills switching over to new supplier with good fix rate and reducing the meters from 13 meters to 4 with huge saving of about 700 pound a year.by dealing with utility wise you will have the same staff member  in the and the phone .
3514|The service provided by Utility Wise has made such a diffrence to us. As a charity with limited resources, the savings we have made through Utility Wise are proving to be very helpful. I can't speak highly enough about our Energy Consultant - he has worked tirelessly to get us the best deals and find plans to suit our organisation. All the hard work has been done for us and we have been kept up to date on progress, every step of the way. Finally,the Utility Wise team have been friendly and willing to help in any way they can - it has been one of the best customer service experiences we have had in a long time!
3515|The service I have received from Utility wise has been excellent. My contact is always available , talks in language I can understand and provides a sensible quote when looking at a new contract.
3516|The person who contacted me over a period was very persistent but the persistence paid off and for what was the first time ever, I should imagine, the church changed its energy provider.   With either a deletion or reduction in standing charged and some adjustment to the unit charges. Anticipated savings of approx. GBP300 per year.   Better in our pocket that theirs !!!!

3519|Everything was satisfactory and I received good service.  I would recommend Utilitywise to my friends. 
3520|The service given to me by all memebers of staff from Utility Wise was excellent and I have already recommended their services to friends and family.
3521|Two Utility wise guys just turned up in our shop without booking. I find this completely unacceptable. For them to come in pairs makes it even worse.
3522|I found that the service i got was excellent and the helpful nature of the staff was also excellent and i would recommend the company to any person trying to find a good deal with out spending hours on the phone and internet. They also got a smart meter for my gas which no one else could promise.
3523|Excellent service - very helpful, good communication throughout whole procedure - recommended.
3524|I couldn't be happier with the service and the prices I have received are better than my previous contracts in the past, overall a short an painless procedure with great results. 
3525|They Found me a fantastic renewal rate for my business electricity. It was all organised with the minimum of fuss and more importantly hardly any forms to fill in. Customer service was grate kept me informed at each stage.  we will be using them again. 
3526|Great service, quick turn a round with available prices and quick receipt of  contract documentation.
3527|Cannot fault the company.Reminded me in good time of the need to renew existing contracts, prompt reply to all queries, offer received was a good one, and went that extra mile to help me when my computer malfunction in delivering the contracts personally.
3528|SUPERB SERVICE THE BEST IN UK ESPECIALLY GENTELMEN VERY HELPFULL AGAIN GREAT GREAT SERVICE
3529|Many thanks to the Team at Utilitywise for their courteous prompt service and getting us the best price available, beating numerous quotes from other utility providers.  Hopefully, Utilitywise can secure a good rate for us when it comes to renewing our Gas contract. 
3530|Fantastic service! I control a busy steel works and within 3 weeks all of my accounts have been organised with a trusted supplier and fixed for a comfortable period. One happy customer highly  recommend. 
3531|helped me get away from a very difficult supplier that was refusing to let me leave, all credit goes to the quick turnaround and the fact that everything is secured for the future of the company.
3532|Fantastic especially as I am going to save money on my utility bill. Very happy with how it was conducted without any pressure. I was recommended to Utilitywise by a client, who he says has not looked back.
3533|Since being introduced to Utility wise - actually recomended to contact Bobby Robson - I havnt looked back.  He is so on the ball.  He returns any queries I have the same day and I know he has our companies best interest at heart.
3534|Very helpful. Able to answer questions i had. Sometimes the company was a little slow with dealing with things but everything was dealt with eventually .   
3535|Took away the pain of changing suppliers, no hassle,saved money delighted with the salesperson who helped us all the way.Also achieved a sensible term on the new Contracts.
3536|I was approached by Utilitywise regarding energy supply like the millions of other companies who have approached us. It must have been a moment of weakness but I agreed to let them investigate and get some quotes for us. That was three years ago and have been more than just a comparison site. they have sorted contracts, investigated and chased queries and always been prompt and responsive to requests. I would recommend them to anyone.
3537|When I was first contacted by Utilitywise, I was sceptical. I couldnt see what they could do for me. How wrong I was. We have a few sites and my account manager, has streamlined all the contracts so they are easier to manage. And they do all the leg work out of contacting the suppliers. The staff are professional, courteous and when they say they will call you, they do. I wish more suppliers had the same work ethic. They are a pleasure to deal with.
3538|It was very good to speak to someone who was prepared to take ownership of my problem and deal with it.  She was polite and helpful and has made good progress in getting my issue sorted.  
3539|We used utilitywise to find new contracts for our gas and electricity supply at two of our business premises.  The customer service was excellent.  I did very little as everything was handled by my relationship manager, who kept me informed but didn't hassle me.  She was very friendly but also professional and efficient.  Since signing the new contracts a couple of minor queries have arisen which have been equally well handled, so I'm pleased to see that the high level of customer service hasn't diminished.Overall I am very happy with the service we received.
3540|Utility Wise were helpful and obtained the prices less than the previous year.
3541|Used in the past and recently contacted as contract coming up for review, takes all the leg work out of getting the best deal.
3542|Was in an urgent need to have a meter transferred from PAYG to Pay monthly and could not figure out what are the best phone number or how to get about with it, however, the staff members at utilitywise made it possible.Just a phone-call and everything was sorted. I was kept updated regularly and was simply amazed with the speed the work was done.I would recommend utility wise to everyone because they are simply wise when it comes to utilities :)
3543|Having used these guys a time or two now - they certainly know their stuff and get things happening.We have swapped energy companies several times now and they seem to get us great deals, certainly much better than the standard packages being offered when it comes to the renewal time. Its a certainty that there is no savings to be had for staying with a company like in the old days.These guys can make the whole change over process seamless without any hitch and can get you great prices and under contract in a matter of hours.Well done - Keep up the great work.
3544|I was initially suspicious when i first spoke to the consultant, and concerned i would end up with a bill from them, but i was pleasantly surprised with the efficient, friendly service and it is a great feeling to let someone else look after your ulility bill regarding renewals and cost of units etc. would definately recommend them!
3545|We are a small surfing wholesalers in Devon, which has been helped by Utilitywise, in particular their representative, to get great electricity pricing for our company, saving us much needed money in these difficult times. She could not have been more helpful, truly understanding our position and delivering on all her promises. Customer service was perfect, friendly and professional. Great service delivery and quality customer service.
3546|We are a local Charity in Peterborough, which has been helped by Utilitywise, in particular their representative, to get great electricity pricing for our Charity, saving us much needed money in these difficult times. He could not have been more helpful, truly understanding our position and delivering on all his promises. Customer service was perfect, friendly and professional. Great service delivery and quality customer service. On behalf of our Charity a very big thank you and keep in touch request. Geoff Johnson Finance Officer
3547|Never a problem and a pleasure speaking with anyone within the company, happy to help and solve all my energy problems with ease. I highly recommend anyone to give them a call.
3548|very pleased with the service received, very pleasant to deal with and always sorts out my queries swiftly and competently. 
3549|Was very pleased with the excellent service which I received . The member of staff was always friendly helpful and informative and I was always kept up to date and informed with the progress  of the  contract. This level of service was the primary reason for changing supplier. I would  strongly recommend them to others.  
3550|Quick, Simple, and most of all as easy as 1,2,3 TOP MARKS. Staff were brilliant and very friendly. 100% 
3551|Very pleased with the service offered. No hard sell, efficient, cost effective and simple. I can;t think of any negatives from my experience with this company.
3552|I was very happy with the service provided for me by the advisor, she was very understanding and helpful young lady and I have spoke to a couple more people who was also helpful, hassle free everything done for me without a worry put all my contracts to end on the same date
3553|My employer has a few sites and we wanted to consolidate the utility suppliers and contract end dates.  With the help of Utility Wise we are now in the process of doing this.  Their help made the process very easy.
3554|Did what you said that you would with as little fuss and troouble as i would wish. Kept it simple and quick. If the savings pan out i shall certanly be using you again in the future, and recommend you to fellow dental technicians. Thankyou 
3555|The service from Utility Wise has been exemplory.  Working in a busy office don't allow you the time you would like to be able to shop around and they are there to take all that stress from you.  At the end of the day, if you don't like what they propose you just don't accept.  They keep a constant eye on your accounts, send you reminders and keep you totally informed about the status of your contracts, talking directly to the suppliers, speaking to contacts they already have, which you don't.  I would certainly recommend the use of Utility Wise.
3556| I am over the moon with the service I have received. Not only have they secured a great deal for me but have at all times been incredibly professional and prompt in all responses to my queries, nothing has felt too much. I have already recommended to a few colleagues and be sure to speak to them, takes all the headaches out if re-newing! 
3557|great service for busy people. I don't have time to do all the shopping around, but I still want the best deal. these guys just get it done. Tell me what I need to know, and cut to the chase.
3558|I was very happy with the service provided for me by the advisor, she was very understanding and helpful young lady and I have spoke to a couple more people who was also helpful thank you
3559|Sean Gleeson our account manager has worked wonders in saving us money and getting us great deals!I would recommend any company to use Sean as he goes the extra 10 miles to get you the right deals.
3560|Good efficient service,  did what they said they would do when they said they would do it. We have used Utilitywise for 5 years now and they have always been very easy to deal with and very good at what they do.
3561|As a company we have used Utilitywise for nearly two years and have not received a bad service. The staff are honest and very helpful. My account advisor got me some great prices on my g&e; accounts and delivered a professional service over the telephone. A+ service every time and a uk based centre with bristish speaking people! definitely recommend :-)
3562|I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had problems with energy suppliers recently. Missing renewal letters that dissapeared in the post and if unchecked your rolled over into a much higher tariff. I'd forgive one but 2. This caught me out and to soften the blow I had to extend the contract to years to get a better unit price.Anyway all the staff at Utilitywise I've dealt over the years have been great with very competitive quotes and made it very easy arranging every energy supplier handover and glad to punish the supplier that did the above as the next available contract was up for renewal with that supplier and went elsewhere.
3563|From my limited dealings with Utilitywise, I am very impressed. Th person who is my contact there and she has been very friendly, helpful and efficient. We have just recently moved into new premises so any savings on utility bills has to be a bonus. It has taken the stress out of moving providers and not having to worry about finding a new/better deal for the next few years.
3564|Utilitywise made the energy contract renewal process straightforward and easy.
3565|I have used Utilitywise for may years now,always found them very helpful and friendly,it is so easy they do all the work for you ,I would recommend them to other business users
3566|I found this service as good this year as it was last year saved us money and effectively an 18% reduction on the initial review offer well done and thank you for a simple and effective process so much better that all the cold calls I received, your agent was polite and knowledgeable and he did exactly what he promised Andrew cash Business development executive A&G; Precision and sons ltd
3567|RIGHT FROM THE START I WAS KEPT UPTO DATE WITH ALL THE DETAILS THAT WAS NEEDED. ALL POINTS WERE COVERED IN DEPTH AND WERE EXPLAINED IN EASY TO UNDERSTAND TERMS. THEY ARE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THERE PRODUCTS AND WERE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR RATHER COMPLICATED GAS AND ELECTIRICITY SUPPLIES WITH NO PROBLEMS.I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE LOOKING TO SORT OUT THERE UTILITY SYSTEMS.WELL DONE TO MY CONSULTANT.
3568|Fast and friendly service and throughout all the changes we just undergone  with complete  confidence with your member of staff in her ability to communicate with us and explain to us every stage of the process allowing us to carry on with running our business without the distraction of dealing with utilty suppliers . The other bonus is any problem  with bills etc we just have to pass on to yourselves to deal and again taking the pressure of ourselves. 
3569|Working as I do for a small charity with a limited budget it was refreshing to deal with someone like Sean Gleeson from Utilitywise who understood how important it was to secure good deals for us on gas and electricity when funds in our sector are so tight. Sean provided a first class, polite and friendly service. I have no hesitation in recommending him and his company.
3570|Have been dealing with Utilitywise for four years now.  On both occasions gas and electricity came up for review they were very helpful and found new contracts.  Its nice to sit back and let someone else sort it out who know what they are doing
3571|Utilitywise found me great deals on both gas and electricity. I put them to my current supplier and got even better deals from them. Excellent result
3572|I have used Utilitywise for approximately 3 years and they have secured competitive pricing for gas and electricity at 3 different sites. Changing suppliers in the past has been a less than pleasant experience and very time consuming however Sean Gleeson from Utilitywise took control and provided a first class, polite and friendly service. I have no hesitation in recommending this company
3573|it was great to get support in setting up at least one of many things during the initial setting up of my new business. The very helpful staff and their continual support from the initial conversation till the final completion was a very big help. The peace of mind that you get from their professional staff I would strongly recommend their service to anyone starting up new business or moving into new home.
3574|We have used Utilitywise for the last couple of years and our account manager is always contactable.  There's no call centre with one telephone number making it pot luck who you speak to.  Direct number straight through to a dedicated account manager.  We have found them to be friendly and helpful getting a good price that is fixed for a good term. I don't know why you would want to take on the task of trawling the suppliers or price comparison sites yourself when Utilitywise will do this for you. Would recommend anyone to use them.
3575|Utilitywise recently became the broker for electricity supplied to my company. The advisor was helpful at explaining what her company did and how they could help me. Although I am currently in contract till 2015 with my current supplier, Utilitywise have helped secure a new contract for 2015 onwards at todays prices which should eliminate any rise in cost or in fact help make a saving. She was very knowledgable and had great manner on the phone. She was prompt in her communication through both phone and email.
3576|I have used Utilitywise for the passed few years and I have always found them to be very friendly and helpful.  The process is quick easy and hassle free and would have no reservations in recommending their service 
3577|We have been using Utilitywise for the past few years and they never fail to get us a great deal on our gas and electricity bills, the staff are always friendly, efficient, speedy and all seem to be very knowledgeable in this area of work! Great!!!
3578|We have previously used Utility Wise, and recommend the service they provide.  They provided us with great value for money from both our gas and electricity contracts. Our advisor was very friendly and approachable, and very knowledgeable about products on the market, and our needs. Overall a very positive experience and outcome which we will be using and recommending to our friends and family.
3579|We first used Utility wise in 2011, Sean our dedicated account manager worked hard to secure us with the best deal for our office premises, and even went to the trouble of dealing with less than helpful electricity suppliers.  We have since asked him to review some of our other utility contacts and are confident he will get us the best deal.Sean guided us through what can be a very complicated process of price comparison which in our busy office I would have had no time to do.  He has kept in touch to make sure we are still happy with the service we have received. I would certainly recommend using utility wise.  Well done!
3580|Changing to Utility Wise as provider for our energy needs has been an easy and hassle free process. We received great support through the processing of our several accounts and enjoyed good on-going communication with any issues swiftly sorted out. Since changing suppliers can, in our past experience be a bit of a 'nightmare' we were comforted by the support and energy Utility Wise put into making this easy and competitive.
3581|It was easy to do and rates were good as far as I am aware.  It didn't take too long either.  Hopefully it will all go smoothly in December when we change suppliers.  Very helpful with any questions I had.  Friendly service from them and paperwork arrived promptly.  However, I didn't like being call by Utility wise by about 3 other members of staff to do the same thing as I had already signed up to.  This need addressing as it did bother me.
3582|In a difficult market to predict - Utilitywise gave us prompt and efficient service in fixing our energy needs for the next 2/3 years.Queries on the best supplier/rates/time to fix and the factors influencing the market were dealt with in a professional and sensible manner to enable a reasonable judgement to be made.Its now a strange twist that having fixed our needs - we would gain a competitive advantage should prices rise!
3583|Utility wise have been very helpful in sorting my energy bills . Particularly my consultant Sean who is always friendly and has done a great job.
3584|We received first class service,we would definately reccomend your member of staff to friends and family,we found him to be very polite and helpful. very knowlegeable in his work .
3585|our current broker got us statrted on a better deal than our existing supplier were willing to give us so we got the ball rolling on that when United utilitywise contacted us, so we decided to see if they could do anything for us and it turned out they could.They got us an even cheaper deal with our existing supplier and helped cancel the new contact we where about to enter. The person handling our case was extremely helpful and kept us upto date with all information.Would recomend them to all our friends, cheers!
3586|was very pleased with the overall service of the member of staff who dealt with our review. very knowledgeable about the products , nothing was to much trouble and saved us a lot of money, would highly recommend to friends, don't think we could have got such a good deal on our own. if i can pick fault the only one would be i don't know why there is a degree of secrecy over who the provider has come in with the best quote is. will come back for a review again in the future and tell my friends. thank you for a hassle free switch and doing all the hard work 4 us!
3587|I used these after a cold call that was good timing as I was in the middle of falling out with my current supplier. The inital call did not take long at all and the paperwork just a form to sign and a copy of my latest bill. Very quickly the call came back with prices that were cheaoer than I was paying. It was with the same supplier which was the down side but the upside is that they utilitywise will deal with them for me from now on so no more long waits on hold. The whole service was very efficient and freindly and I couldn't fault that. In a busy office what Utiltywise asked for as manageable, it has saved me money and hopefully future hassle. For me it's a no brainer and would definately recommend. Only reason not given 5 stars is that I have not had to use their after sales service yet so don't know what that is like. Though my expectations are high after the service I have recieved so far.
3588|The person we dealt with was efficient and very helpfull in checking out a new supplier with the best prices. 
3589|The person at UtilityWise was very patient and considerate.  We are very busy, one of us being Deaf and UtilityWise sorted out our Utility provision with minimal fuss.  Excellent Service.We will be recommending the service to friends and family when we start to receive our new charges and will demonstrate to them how easy it was to deal with your company and the representative who was extremely patient and did a brilliant job.
3590|The energy consultant was very polite and informative, he explained everything very clearly and what the process would be from start to finish.I now don't need to worry about looking round to renew my contracts. I also received some great and professional energy service advice and have a great deal for our gas and electricity for the next 4 years.Once again Thank You Utilitywise! 
3591|An excellent service was provided by the advisor. She did her utmost to get us the best deal possible and kept us informed at each stage of the process. I would happily recommend Utlitywise to anyone looking for a great deal with top customer service! Many thanks for all your help!
3592|AS YET NO SERVICE HAS BEEN PROVIDED. ONLY COMMUNICATION BY PHONE & E-MAIL, THEREFORE I DO NOT FEEL I CAN REALLY COMMENT IN DETAIL.  
3593|The person from the beginning was very good to work with. From someone who knows very little about the world of utilities I was very impressed and felt assured that I had someone helping me. I encountered a lot of problems with one company but I was talked through what to do and even better he sent me through a written out letter to send off straight away, as managing a busy restaurant does not give me a lot of time to write them myself. I truly was very pleased with the service and I've been assured that he will still be in touch with regards the problem company and I have no doubt that he will. Also nice to talk to someone with such good telephone manner!
3594|I received good service from Utilitywise throughout the whole process.  I was kept informed of all progress and details were emailed to me as requested.Once a decision had been made everything was explained fully to me and a simple form was sent to me to complete.I would happily recommend Utilitywise to my family and friends.
3595|I found the initial approach to be friendly and informative unlike some companies that try to bambozal you with information.The follow up calls were short and helpful and the deal obtained was very good.I would recommend Utilitywise to other businesses.
3596|Very good customer service provided by Mark Robinson. The product was fully explained to me and i am pleased with the outcome. I look forward to our business making considerable savings in future. I would encourage others to review their current suppliers also.  Brian DennisonHebburn Iona Social Club   
3597|Utilitywise made all arrangements for my electricity account.  The service was quick, friendly and hassle free.  The information they provided was easy to understand, making the decision easy and quick.  I would use them again and recommend them to others.  Most of the contact was through email, which I prefer.  
3598|I have nothing but praise for the service offered by Utility Wise and their first class team members.  Negotiating energy prices can be a minefield of misleading information.  I am confident that this company have offered me the best price for both gas and electricity.  
3599|We found Utilitywise to be extremly helpful, They took the time to really help us with a few problems we were having with previous contracts and suppliers.We would happily contact them again in the future if we need advice or information. We also dealt with the same person through the weeks which really helped as they knew and understood what was required without having to explain it each time.  Thank you for a very happy service.
3600|The Staff I was dealing with is very efficient and respond within few minutes of inquiring. Always give a detailed explanation of the product. 
3601|This was a good friendly service, really happy with all the help I got
3602|We have used Utilitywise for the last several years now and the customer service has always been good. It takes the effort out of renewing utility contracts and the prices were very competitive. We will be using them for future renewals.
3603|A big thanks to the advisor and the service / savings she has provided for our company. Very professional, helpful and knowledgeable. She was friendly and easy to deal with, calling at convenient times and doing the vast majority of the leg work making the transition to new suppliers both quick and easy, with no hidden fees and quotations being explained clearly. Whilst other companies I have dealt with in the past have been pushy, I must say the service provided by her at Utilitywise was great!
3604|i found that on the whole the information i was helped with was very good and the comeback was fast and efficient
3605|Utilitywise people were very helpful and efficient. 
3606|After being contacted by utility wise the operator was above and beyond my expectations, she made me feel very confident in the company.She sorted our needs out and even helped in another matter witch was not business related.We never felt like we were being pushed into anything, we were just given the options and asked was this something we thought we would like to do.When it comes to recommending this company to any of my business friends then the answer would be yes.
3607|We were approached by Utilitywise and after a swift appraisal, fixed price deals were struck that provided value for money tariffs and allowed me to budget with certainty. I would recommend them to other similar small businesses.
3608|The help in securing a business gas contract that will keep our fuel prices at today's levels until January 2018 has been outstanding. The expertise that was offered was excellent with all the details of the quotation explained clearly. We would not hesitate to recommend Utilitywise to any company looking to receive clear impartial advice
3609|I found the gentleman I spoke to extremely helpful, he went out of his way to inform me of different deals for our company, all information was easily understood and I am confident he had our best interests at heart, it was particularly nice to speak to someone who was pleasant and easy to talk to.I would certainly recommend Utility Wise without any hesitation.Keep up the good work
3610|Utilitywise and especially their agent came up trumps when we negotiated our new prices for the coming years.  We were very happy with every aspect that was discussed and also the outcome that was achieved during our telephone conversation.  As ever, the courtesy and professional attitude that was extended to us was very much appreciated.  Well done!!
3611|Fantastic experience! great management and i am confident that my prices are the best on the market at present. Don't second think it! just trust them and your in good hands.
3612|Running a multiple of businesses, it's always important to know you are getting the best deal when it comes to service providers, most energy companies make it very complicated to obtain good deals, they are all different and have many cunning ways to entice you in, utility wise make it stress free and very uncomplicated. If utility wise keep up this kind of service and client liaison, I will be sticking with them, extremely efficient, no nonsense, friendly manner on all correspondence. Thanks utilitywise. 
3613|I am delighted with the service I received from Utilitywise when I was approached by them to act on our behalf. The process was clearly explained and carried out without an hitch. A highly satisfied customer.
3614|I have recently had to install a new gas meter and supply at my commercial premises. With the help of Mark Leeming (Energy Consultant)at Utilitywise I was able to receive good direct advise on how to, where from, and when I could expect the service to be provided and at a competitive price. Red Tape can affect your judgement, but with Marks help navigation through PLC energy suppliers became much less stressful. Thank You Alan Clarke AMTC ltd 
3615|I dealt with an advisor at Utilitywise regarding my business energy contracts. Prior to this, because one of the contracts was reaching the end, I was inundated with calls from energy companies and brokers all trying to get us to move our account to them. I am always busy and it was becoming a real pain taking all these sales calls. All I was looking for was someone I could trust that could find the best deal with no catches. She was brilliant, she made it all easy and came up with really good deals and no hard sell. Utilitywise saved me lots of time sorting it out and saved us money on our future bills.
3616|The person who contacted me was most polite, not pushy but most informative about what he was offering.  Once we had provided the information needed for him to compare prices he came back quite quickly,giving us several options.  As we are a members club these things have to be agreed by the General Committee which I told him, he did not try to rush us into making a decision or put any pressure on us. The Committee decide they only wanted to go for a 12 month deal as they felt they know better, this was not a problem and we were given details in a matter of days which were agreed upon and the documentation has been dealt with 
3617|"When I finally ""made"" time to listen to James, and the service he offered from Utilitywise, I have found him to be very efficient and helpful with his advice. He kept me completely informed on a daily basis as to our developments with the supply renewals, which was excellent service.I am responsible for renewing electricity contracts on four different meters, and it is a really hard task to keep on top of competitive prices. I am frequently bombarded by other ""Utility Comparison"" companies, and almost always haven't the time or ability to go through the lengthy process. So far, the swap over to a new supplier has been reasonably easy, with good prices supplied via James. I've yet to see how it all runs when we change suppliers, as I am always dubious, but I am confident that Utilitywise would help me throughout. There were many problems sending him information via fax,due to problems at their end, and must confess that a less ""patient"" person than myself would have almost given up at that point! However, James' extremely pleasant and helpful manner encouraged me to continue, with success. Hope you can sort his dept out with a new fax machine, which actually works!"
3618|Our company have used utility wise for our previous 2 renewals.  The first time was easy, a letter to give authority, renewal cost and the meter readings. This time was even easier, just the renewal cost.  The service is excellent and they don't intrude on my working day, a quick email or telephone call to confirm points and that is it. Quick and to the point.  I would highly recommend.
3619|Renewing an utility contract can be an exasperating situation at the best of times. Utility wise helped make the changeover seem effortless. The individual service received from the energy consultant was first class. Over a fair number of conversations every step of the way was explained satisfactorily. We are very pleased with the outcome.
3620|Very easy and fast process to change our electricity supplier, thank you.
3621|We had a shaky start as our original account manager left, but we were contacted quickly and deal was put in place without any hiccups with our new account manager, anything we have asked of them they have completed quickly and efficiently while saving us some money. Services they have offered include switching suppliers to a better rate and arranging for the power to be turned on in our new building.
3622|Good service. I was a little weary to start with and to be honest thought it wasn't worth my time. But I have now managed to get a really good deal for my electricity right up until 2017.The customer service I received was excellent and all phone calls and conversations were organised around me so I didn't feel like I was being hassled or interrupted. I'm glad I took the time out to work with UtilityWise as they have saved my business money. 
3623|I found Utility Wise very helpful and persistent in finding me and my business the right deal to provide the energy contract I needed and save me money.
3624|I Have been dealing with Utilitywise since our company was incorporated with other merger and become Ltd company. Sean Gleeson has shown his dedication as our account manager and I would never look back since then. Sean is very committed to deliver to the highest standard. I still don't have to think about when my contract will expire and to stress about finding new better rates. I know I can rely on Utilitywise and on Sean. I would recommend the service to everyone. Katherine Cassidy P.S value for money is definitely there as you don't have to pay for their great advise.
3625|Good servcie. Negotiated new triffifs on our behalf which will hopefully reduce our utility cost. Thank you.
3626|The staff at Utility Wise are friendly and helpful throughout the process what is more they saved us money on our utility bills we have used this company for several Years and look forward to doing so in the future,I like the fact that they always get in touch well before end of contracts which gives ample time to sort out the next ones there for enshuring you can get the best deal.Highly recommendable.
3627|Been with the company for the past 8 years, always finding the best prices for small businesses , always take your needs on board . Very polite and understanding and patient .Even will find a better deal if you come back with one yourself from the search engines.Found it difficult sometimes to take there calls as not based in the office, and work with children. 
3628|Spoke to a staff member there on several occasions as we had several energy supply contracts to renew.  Always excellent, rang and emailed when promised.  Very friendly, listened to our requirements and gave a spot on recommendation every time.Saved us money and was a pleasure to deal with.Would recommend without reservation.
3629|This was a very good service, and we were very impressed. By switching from British Gas our electricity bill is going down by nearly 4p per day unit, despite British Gas wanting to increase our unit charge if we had stayed with them.Thank you for your persistance in persuading us to change
3630|I have dealt with a few of the utility wise team and all of them have been very helpful. It is handy that they know when our contracts are running out and keep us on track before we are rolled on to an out of contract rate and get stung high prices. It is also handy that they can write to your supplier and stop the contract rolling on as well, especially if you are like me and have a lot on and forget to put the letter in. I will definitely be letting utility wise help with future contracts. 
3631|I have a number of business properties which are difficult to keep tabs on my energy manager efficiently sorted them out for me.  very helpful
3632|Very helpful, easy to talk to, explained everything in great detail finds you the best price and cheapest  supplier, excellent service 
3633|I work in a charity and found working with Sean Gleeson  from Utilitywise a real pleasure. He always called when he said he would and worked hard to find the best prices. He also would not pressure me in the slightest and respect my decision when I made it. He would also remeber when the contracts were due and come with a fair price, which working in a charity is what we want. I would use him and the service again with no qualms.
3634|I am always sceptical of sales calls though my attention was caught by utility wise when they first called- mainly due to the time I couldn't afford, but was spending, trying to organise the company utility bills for various sites. I was still wary after a few phone calls but after dealing with their representative over the last few months I can now say that I am very pleased that I stayed with them. They are always quick at responding to queries, no matter how small, via an email or phone call. They have looked at each individual energy requirement and found the best tariffs for us as well as saving me many hours being on hold. They pretty much take all the hassle out of utilities. So far I am very pleased-it is nice to have one helpful contact who you feel is on side.
3635|This is our second year of signing up with Utilitywise. We have had other companies competing for our supply but we have gone with Utilitywise again due to their cheap prices, good service and pleasant competent staff.
3636|Thank you for your help and advice and ease of letting somebody else carry out all the hardwork of finding energy suppliers for several Units. I have always received friendly and courtesous telephone calls and whatever my questions even if I feel they are silly I have not been made to feel as though they are.It has taken away the hassle of sorting things out with me just leaving the utilites as they are, some of which are high with high standing charges.You have always responded quickly to my email/telephone queries.
3637|We have been using Utility Wise now for a number of years, found them to be very helpful, the changes have saved us money with very little effort on our part.
3638|Our account was dealt with well and within plenty of time of our previous contract coming to an end. The information given was plenty.  Confusion that arose was cleared up without any problems. There was plenty of opportunity to talk directly with friendly people at Utilitywise rather than having to rely on emails.
3639|We are a Methodist Church with two sites, and therefore potentially have four contracts for gas and electricity supplies. We have previously been pro-active in ensuring that we enjoy the best prices by constantly reviewing and switching suppliers on fixed term and price contracts. As treasurer working in a voluntary capacity, this is time consuming. Utility Wise have taken this over, and have ensured that we have had full information about our options in a timely manner. They have discussed this with us and answered our questions, and we have always retained the power to make the final decision. They have also kept us informed of developments which may be of interest to us, and we have recently obtained a favourable contract extension to our existing agreement, which now takes us to 2019. I have always found them helpful and friendly in my dealings with them and would recommend them to colleagues.
3640|They are pushy almost go as far as to say harassing! Even pushing you to write a review. Did what they said they would do and found good enough deal. Would rather have had a bit of time to think things over and discuss with manager/accountants etc.
3641|I was very wary when I was initially contacted having had call after call from the myriad of people wanting to get me the best deal. Utilitywise were professional, extremely helpful and patient as I required authorisation from Trustees before proceeding.  The only company who agreed to communication in writing by email to facilitate decision making. We are now on fixed rates and have the advantage of being able to say to any new callers - we have a company who works specifically for us. Thank you Utilitywise.
3642|When first contacted by Utilitywise I was very hesitant to get involved with them and thought it best to go direct to the energy provider.  Their friendly approach, not too pushy, encouraged me to listen to what they had to say and I proceeded to sign up with them to obtain the best energy deal.They take the hassle out of trawling through comparison sights and if they do not get the deal you want they go that extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction.  
3643|We have used Utilitywise for a number of years and have found their service to be excellent  They have enabled our company to find the best rates from the assortment of energy providers. Our main contact has been efficient & knowledgeable and made the whole process simple which has been invaluable to us. He has also got a lovely manner and sense of humour which made the whole process much easier - an excellent representative for his company. Thank you our help.
3644|Quick response, helpful and professional at all times. Provided a variety of options and the advisor discussed each one with me to make sure I had all the data I needed to make an informed decision.  Would definitely use again and would also recommend to other business users. 
3645|Prompt and very knowledgeable responses to all questions and well reasoned recommendations. Will use again
3646|Everything thing was done over email and a telephone conversation over the phone. This meant it took very little time and gave me the best price. 
3647|Good customer service and follow up phone calls.
3648|good communication, great perseverance, recommend highly.
3649|Good people to deal with and very good at selecting the best supplier
3650|I have a small business & was looking for competitive utility prices. Utilitywise was very helpful & understanding to my needs.Their helpful & well informed staff have negotiated some very good deals on electricity and gas prices. They have saved me a lot of time & effort shopping around for the best prices from various suppliers. 
3651|Lots of information provide to enable an informed decision as to whether to switch utility provider and contract. Very helpful member of staff.
3652|Your energy consultancy has been helpful, their advice has been considered and of value up to now, and we hope and expect it to continue to prove to be so.
3653|We were contacted by Jan advisor at Utilitywise; we have many utility contracts, and he quickly sourced the best prices for all of them, and even went back a couple of times to tailor it to our specific requirements. Although, he maintained regular contact to see if we would like to go with Utilitywise, we never felt pushed in to using the company. Ultimately this has been a huge time and money saving exercise.
3654|Since using utility wise for our business energy in July 2010, we have been very pleased with the service and diligence of their staff. My first contact was Mitchell Cannon and since Aug 2012 we have been dealing with Paul Wintrip. It is nice to have contact with one person that deals with all your needs and has always been efficient. 
3655|At the point of contact from Utility Wise I had been bombarded with quotations from numerous companies and it was becoming very confusing and annoying. However, it was the member of staff at Untility Wise that was very patient and helpfull answering all my questions. Obviously the aim was for them to get the sale but they never put on the pressure. We renewed both the gas and electricity contracts at the same time which, are now just coming on line. So far so good all seems to be running smoothly.It also good to know I can speak to the same person every time I have a question and calls are returned promptly.
3656|Avoid at all costs. Promise the earth and very smooth sales people. Tied us into a 3 year contract 50% above the best rates in the market. I regret ever speaking to them.
3657|I recently had dealings with utilitywise, their energy consultant was very helpful , confident, and co-operative to my businesses requirements. would not hesitate in recommending my business contacts to look at what uwise can offer them.
3658|I would certainly recommend Utilitywise - Jarlath Cooke was especially helpful, nothing was ever a bother for him, he explained everything in a way that I could understand and answered all my questions putting us at ease. I think he is an absolute asset to the Company,his customer-service skills are second to none,  Well Done Utilitywise, but more importantly, Well Done Jarlath (You are a Star) - Thank-You.
3659|Utilitywise helped us get a better deal for our electricity contract renewal. They managed to get the annual price down by ca. GBP300 which was fantastic. our contact at Utilitywise took us through the whole process of setting up the account and we only had one contact from start to finish and didn't have to go through lengthy discussions with energy suppliers etc. Since we only just signed the contract we didn't make use of all the additional services of Utilitywise just yet, but so far things have been going great.
3660|We were approached By Utility Wise and accepting their offer to select the right supplier was correct. We have been kept up to date with prices and have extended our contract on that basis
3661|Was cold called by this company and they must have caught me on a good day as I agreed for them to look at our gas and electic contracts when they came up for renewal.  When they were due they called back and took lots fo details to enable them to get the best price they could.  The member of staff always called when she said she would and keep me fully informed at all points.  We went ahead with the proposed contracts.  All questions were answered satisfactorily.  I never felt under sales pressure from the contact who dealt with me, there is a very fine line between informative sales style and hard sell, it was just the right side of being fine.  I hope the transistion to new suppliers goes as well as setting up the contracts.  I will re-review if not as happy at that point! So far though very good......... 
3662|We were first contacted by Utilitywise in September 2013 and they carried out a review of our existing suppliers telling us we were on the best tariffs at that time.  No hard sell to transfer or fees incurred.  We contacted them in January 2014 when our gas company proposed an increase to our tariff.  The consultant at Utilitywise managed to get us a better tariff with our existing company, so no hassle of changing companies.  The consultant was professional and appeared knowledgeable, whilst being friendly.  We were able to save time contacting various utilities and got a better deal on our gas supply.We would recommend Utilitywise to anyone wanting to get the best out of their utility suppliers. 
3663|They are very pushy almost go as far as to say harassing! Did what they said they would do and found good enough deals but do not like the way they operate. Would rather have had a bit of time to think things over and discuss with manager/accountants etc.

3665|I would never use a company like this however running a very busy childcare centre is difficult and when it comes to utilitys i usually let it roll over as i do not have the time to call my suppliers. The service is without fault and my accounts are all with one supplier... a bit pushy at times however i can now relax and enjoy the benefits and savings i will see over the next few years.thank you utilitywise Seonaid MckayMagic roundabout childcare 
3666|I get constant calls from energy brokers everyday. My contact was very polite. What more can I say?
3667|Utility wise has been very helpful in finding us the best competitive rate for our electricity usage.  They are very professional and inform you every step of the way. They have made switching companies very easy.  I would recommend using this company to other small businesses.
3668|we are with utility wise since few year and enjoying good prices with best services and we highly recommended them to all.thanks 
3669|Utilitywise give us a price which was more than 50% higher than the standard rate available with our current provider online. When I discovered this and wrote to them to rescind any authority they had to deal with our electricity supply, they insisted that the contract at that price was already in place, although it turns out that it wasn't. Following that, I got notification from our current supplier that they had attempted to terminate our existing contract, using the letter of authority that I had already rescinded about 2 weeks earlier. Avoid. And anyone who thinks they're getting good service, I suggest you double check the online price before committing to anything. This contract would have cost us several thousand pounds extra a year if we hadn't questioned it. 
3670|I have used Utilitywise twice now to sort out my electricity contract. Although I have only a small business, I have been treated with utmost importance and they cannot do enough for you. I have found the whole procedure stress-free, and what's more they have both times negotiated me prices which are far better than the prices I was being quoted by the electricity company. I would have no hesitation in recommending Utilitywise to anyone, and will be using them the next time.
3671|I have been working with the same member of staff for a number of years now. Eventually moving all my separate business over. He keeps me well informed and is always able to deal with everything very efficiently.
3672|Welcomed flexible approach to negotiation with suppliers which made assessing options relatively easy.Willingness to think laterally about how to combine separate users.Looking after clients interests with proactive stance.An occasion when slow to follow up.
3673|I received a renewal letter from our current energy supplier informing me that the contract was due to expire and to let them know in writing if it wasn't to be renewed. Utilitywise had already sourced us a better deal, so I contacted them to see if I had to write to the existing company.  within an hour I had received a response informimg me that Utilitywise had it all in hand and they will be dealing with it - nothing for me to do thank you! 
3674|We were very impressed with the clear courteous and friendly advice we received and the reduction of payments to our utility companies. Within a day our dedicated accounts manager came back to us with reductions on our payments Many thanks it was a pleasure for us to do business with you. 
3675|I'm from the fishing charity the Fishermen's Mission. I was first contacted and I'm always sceptical about a one stop shop however they know there stuff and take time to understand us as well.Sean at Utilitywise has always been helpful, honest and understanding. Down to earth his style suits the demands of our busy charity. We need to be aware of costs all the time and Sean at Utilitywise has helped with that headache.
3676|The Guy was really friendly and very Helpful. Full of Knowledge and guided us as a small company the best route to take for our energy supplies.No hard pushing to take up offers, which make a nice change.Overall very pleased with the efficient service provided.would highly recommend to take the free service utilitywise offer !!
3677|Utilitywise sorted us a great deal for our electricity and are now looking to get all our sites in line with the same contract date. Proactively looking at the contract even though the earliest is not due for renewal next year to ensure we are on the best contract. I would thoroughly recommend Utilitywise to anyone looking for the best energy deals with the least hassle.
3678|Utility Wise arranged gas (2 meters) & electricity (3 meters) contracts for us last year which expired in October 2015 & March 2015 respectively.  Recently they negotiated with the suppliers and both have now extended the contracts with only modest increases until January 2017.  We are very pleased to have been able to fix our energy costs for the next 3 years.
3679|With 3 electricity meters and 1 gas that had different contract end dates the time I would have needed to spend to get these sorted would have been intrusive.  The consultant was helpful and even rationalised the contract end dates. I recommend Utilitywise very highly as a professional and efficient service.  Thanks for your assistance.
3680|Got me a great deal on our gas contract, saved us money each year, friendly efficient service.
3681|Received an excellent service from start to finish from Utilitywise. They were very helpful and easy to deal with and managed to find our company a really good deal.  We have recently moved offices and are looking to use Utilitywise again and would not hesitate to recommend them to our business contacts.
3682|Utilitywise has been incredibly beneficial in supporting and finding the best possible energy supplier for our requirements and being a registered charity not blessed with high reserves, cost was very important and something they easily factored into their findings. The process was very simple as far as the society are concerned allowing us to continue about our everyday business safe in the knowledge our energy requirements were being looked after competently and effectively.
3683|Sean Gleeson has been very helpful with advice on energy prices and market review.  He has executed contracts with energy suppliers in a very efficient manner. I am happy to continue using his services.
3684|James has been a great help in moving us onto a tariff where we are going to save some money.  He has explained everything clearly and made the whole process painless.  We feel we know what we are signing up for and will be pleased to be dealing with him going forward.
3685|We have used utility wise for our electric and gas. we have had a great customer service experience and they are very professional. i would recommend them to other merchants. Gary @ Total building materials
3686|As a non-profit making small college Utilitywise have been instrumental in substatially reducing our gas and electricity costs for the next three to four years.  Our account manager was very patient, answering any queries promptly and in ways that made it easier to explain to non-financial colleagues. I have no hesitation in passing contact details on to other colleges who have asked.
3687|My overall experience with Utilitywise and the advisor was excellent. They were very helpful and patient with all the little annoying questions I asked! I would definitely recommend to others. Thank you very much for making life a little easier!!
3688|Our manager was very helpful and efficient , and got us a great deal
3689|Our contact at Utility Wise worked extremely hard to find the best deal on the market for us. Having secured a deal early on she went the extra mile to improve on it. We are now in the position of having secured an acceptable price in a volatile market. Thanks!
3690|Utilitywise have been very helpful in assisting us with changing our electricity and gas providers, and have helped us to save money on our utility bills. They have very good customer service, are reliable and have been extremely helpful.Our contact at Utilitywise has always been very helpful when we have been in contact with him and very prompt in resolving with any problems we have had.
3691|Very pleasant helpful and patient. Not to pushy When you are busy in work it helps to get someone who is mindful of that. Would certainly recommend utilitywise and the advisor in particular.
3692|Very helpful & knowledgeable, takes the stress off a company looking for the best prices on their utility bills.  
3693|As a charity when we were looking around for the best rates and save money, Utilitywise came to our aid.  They been very professional, thorough and more than willing to answer questions, not only that were able to give us a best deal.Utilitywise can deliver unlike many others in this field.  I would recommend Utilitywise to anyone who is serious about quality of service, customer care and saving money.Keep up the good work.
3694|Utility wise have been very helpful in agreeeing an electricity contract for our  manufacturing facility
3695|A short and brief review to praise all staff at Utilitywise.  They are very customer friendly, extremely helpful, reliable and we are pleased that they take the pressure off us by working out the best supplier each year.
3696|The person that I dealt with at Utilitywise was very patient with us while we put an agreement in place with them. With three electricity and three gas supplies it had become very difficult to track the contracts and the task of seeking out the best deals was daunting. Utilitywise have used their expert knowledge of the market to understand the terms of our current contracts and then find better prices for us and have thus taken away the problems associated with dealing directly with multiple suppliers. The lady assigned to our case was very helpful and kept me informed at each stage of progress.
3697|Dealing with this company was made very easy from start to finish.  The member of staff I dealt with was very informative and kept me up to date with everything.  I would have no hesitation in recommending them.
3698|An advisor from Utility Wise rang our company out of the blue and our attitude was if you can save us some money please do. Right from the start we found our account handler to be very informative and persistent. She was very professional with dealing with our accounts in a fair and business like manner.
3699|I have been impressed with their knowledge of the market and the fairness of their advice.As a micro business sometimes it's easier to stay with the devil you know but the discussions I had with my energy consultant convinced me change and I am glad I did.Would not hesitate to recommend them to colleagues in similar  businesses as ours.
3700|So glad I appointed this company. Its taken the stress off my shoulders. Someone else to sift through mountains of figures. Someone else to rectify any hiccups, no-one to have to nag on a daily basis to get things put right. My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner instead of trying to fight my previous suppliers on my own. Had attempted research for different supplier but not that confident re how to do this over the internet. Utilitywise handled change over to new suppier with apparent ease. I was kept informed at all stages. The chap who was assigned to my cause couldn't have been more helpful or reassuring. Thanks
3701|I've found the staff very helpful and keen to make cuts to our costs wherever possible.   However, I would like more comparisons with other providers in the future.
3702|Found our account handler to be excellent in his handling of the electricity supply. The company are upfront at the top levels dealing with accounts in a very fair and business like manner. Would recommend them for future.
3703|Painless and effortless, would recommend this service.  Account handler was very efficient and friendly.
3704|Overall a very good service. Change of energy supplier went without a hitch. Very happy with communication with service advisor. Would recommend.
3705|Since Utilitywise came into my life I have had the hassle taken away of having to ring around each provider trying to find the best price.  All the people I have dealt with within the Company have been very helpful and I would like to think that they are working on my behalf rather than the Utility companies!
3706|The service that we have received from Sean at Utilitywise has been excellent,he has found us the best energy deals and really has his finger on the pulse. I could spend a lot of time and energy chasing around to get the best deal but here I have someone that does that for me,I just wish that all the other problems in the office could be sorted the same way.You are doing a great job for us, please continue!!!!I cannot think of any negatives about dealing with Utilitywise, they really do a great job.
3707|Very busy office manager with no time to look for best deals. Utility wise saved me time and money and made the whole process quick and easy.
3708|My accountmanager is the most patient person I have dealt with, nothing is to much trouble, and he explains everything in laymans terms. I tried various companies before using Utilitywise.I am pleased to say that Utilitywise not only beat them on price but also on customer services.You don't get harrased and if you are not ready to commit to something they don't try to push you into anything
3709|I deal with all the electricity and gas contracts for a large Parish Church with several properties. As a volunteer I did not really have time to search out the best prices for these. In addition, commercial contracts are much more complicated than domestic ones. Sean Gleeson at Utilitywise has looked after our contracts for several years now and we are more than satisfied with the service we have been given, as well as the reduction in charges for our valuable donated funds. I have recommended him recently to another Parish in our city.
3710|Helpful advice and service from people who know the energy market, and take on board the needs of their customer.Any questions or queries I had, I was able to speak directly to my dedicated account manager, who took the time to explain the different tariffs to me in a way I could relate back to my Trustees. They patiently answer most the questions. when the best deal introduce in the  energy market, I get the call form the dedicated manger. You no need to speak to call centre people. My experience, the response from this company is best.  
3711|Helpful advice and service from people who know the energy market, and take on board the needs of their customer. 
3712|Utilitywise are a company that took on all the requirements by the Charity I work for and came back to me with deals on both the gas and electricity, that were worded in English - with no jargon so I could feed this back to all the Trustees to enable them to make an informed decision.  Any questions or queries I had, I was able to speak directly to my dedicated account manager, who took the time to explain the different tariffs to me in a way I could relate back to my Trustees.  They never made us feel as though we were wasting their time, even after giving them our business, they are still in contact making sure that everything is OK and I feel as though I could call on them at any time if I had an issue.
3713|Sean Gleeson was appointed our account manager about 3 mths ago. We had a major issue with our gas provider which had been dragging on since Sept 12. Sean got the issue resolved, quickly, efficiently and communicated regularly with me on his progress. I could not fault the service he provided in a friendly manner; well done
3714|Very prompt on obtaining comparative prices. Will use in the future when current deals expire.
3715|We were contacted by Utilitywise regarding our energy bills and the contracts we currently have. The person I spoke to, (unlike others who have contacted us,)seemed to have a good grasp of the whole system of energy supply and contracts, if perhaps a little pushy. Utilitywise have put in place a new contract for our electricity supply with a better rate which begins in May this year, an audit of our electricity consumption will also be carried out free of charge.Many thanks      
3716|We have used Utility wise for some years now.  They offer a consistent highquality service and have saved us a great deal on our energy bills during that time. Once more they have managed to reduces costs for us as we go forward into another contract. We can highly recommend them.
3717|Very helpful & thorough with obtaining our business and did their best to work round us, even for a small company like ourselves they helped us get exactly what we required for our level of usage. great to have the one point of call through Utilitywise rather than directly dealing with Energy companies & getting someone different every time. 
3718|Utility Wise's consultant will promise you earth yet when it comes to delivering the service it's dire. Our electric contract was to expire in Jan 2014 yet on the June 2013 I was assured that utilitywise was the only company that could offer 5 year contract. We signed up. The deal looked to good to be true. Infact it was.  3 months later I had a call saying energy company had changed the way they calculate the credit and we would be offered another deal with another provider. The contract length has been reduced to 2 years and the cost per unit had increased by 30%. It had to be done on the said day otherwise the prices would increase more. So I was told.  After that deal was signed we received a letter from npower that the 'electricity  termination is invalid' I got in touch with the Utility Wise, it took a number of calls before anyone responded even then I had chase them to find out that had submitted the transfer application, prior to the 3 months allowed.  Our npower contract is due to expire tomorrow and a month ago I received a second letter from them saying 'Electric termination notice is invalid'. Again I tried to get in touch with the energy consultant and their support team at Utility Wise, by phone, email and fax. To my horror I still have not heard from them. I got in touch with Npower to resolve the problem myself.  This time it was mistaken notice Npower.  The fact that I had to resolve these problems with the suppliers myself is contradiction to what is promised by the charming consultants  I'm extremely disappointed at the service utilitywise have provided so far.  The whole point of going through a 3rd party (Utilitywise ) was to take make things easier.  Utility Wise have proved me so wrong. What I would like to see is the ability to pull out of a contract the day before it goes live so I don't feel robbed and denied relief for years to follow.
3719|We have been using Utility wise for over a year and couldn't be more pleased. This is a company that actually has your business' best interests at heart. As a small business, we are all too familiar with those sweet talking sales people who never quite come up with the goods. We work with an advisor, it's always him on the end of the phone, he calls us frequently and never has to 'look at our records' before he addresses our needs. The amount of customer care and consideration that this person puts into his job is an asset to Utility wise and I'm sure that they only employ the best in their field. I can highly recommend Utility wise to any business, whatever the size as they will always contact you if you could be saving money.
3720|I Have been with Utilitywise for some time now i can definetly say i am more than happy with the service they provide and would recommend them as a company to deal with
3721|We only deal with Utility Wise for renewing our business utility supplier contracts.They provide excellent and informative service, taking the confusion out of attempting this process ourselves.
3722|"After accepting their offer to switch from my gas & energy supplier, only the energy switch was successful.The gas switch was objected by my current supplier because they ""did not receive a termination ntice by the date required"". Utilitywise did manage to get a good deal from the new supplier but, until Nov. 2014 (we are in January) I'll be paying double price for the gas of the old supplier. Utilitywise stated that this inconvenient was due to internal reorganization of my current supplier, which I hardly believe. In my opinion was instead due to the change of the person in charge of my account at Utilitywise.Never again!"
3723|I found the entire process very helpful and the member of staff that dealt with me was extremely professional, thorough, re assuring and made sure that I understood every step of the entire process and what would be required of me and when.  In an industry that often gets bad press regarding its level of service I can only say that this experience was first class the entire time and I would be delighted to recommend this individual to anyone requiring this or a similar service.  thank you so much.
3724|We were very sceptical at first , then eventually warmed up to the idea of using utility wise  the energy consultant was very informative,friendly and very professional. 
3725|We have used Utilitywise for the first time to negotiate our electricity contract. Their representative was fast and efficient both on the telephone and via email. He was a pleasure to deal with and took all the hassle out of comparing prices and dealing with our contract negotiations. When you are busy trying to run your business that's a massive help. We would certainly recommend using Utilitywise to anyone and will do so ourselves again in the future.
3726|Utilitywise provided an excellent service and took the pressure out of what was a particularly hectic time for our business.  More specifically, our account representative was helpful and informative throughout the whole process and continually kept in touch with us.  Despite having to leave our premises early, our representative maintained a professional and friendly approach taking on the work that could have easily slowed the process of moving if we had taken it on.I would recommend Utilitywise to other businesses.
3727|Good customer service with the advisor looking after everything from start to finish. Would recommend Utilitywise as they found me a great deal.
3728|Very pleased with Utility Wise, contact got me a good deal, he looks after my account with enthusiasm.Sorts out problems that arise urgently. Will continue to contact Utility Wise with future business.
3729|great customer service, real friendly team of people, saved money and they take care of everything. would recommend - wish we found them years ago. 
3730|Would definitely recommend.Very helpful staff and excellent customer service.Very informative and kept us up to date with progress of order
3731|Would definitely recommend. James Lambert-Parker dealt with our supplies professionally, making huge savings on our current bills.Just disappointed we never used Utilitywise sooner!
3732|Very helpful staff member and excellent customer service.  Explained the process fully and very informative!  Kept to promises regarding callbacks and emails etc.
3733|Dealt with Utility Wise who was most helpful and informative. Much easier to deal with than the energy companies themselves and seem to genuinely want to reduce your energy outgoings.
3734|We have nothing but praise for the service we received upon arranging a switch for our electricity supply. The service was both efficient and friendly, and the call back necessary were made at the exact time promised.Hope this is maintained and that you obtain the new  business that is merited.
3735|The member of staff who contacted me was very helpful from the beginning and genuinely wanted to find me the best deal for my business. I would recommend anyone to use them and I saved money!
3736|The consultant found me an excellent electricity deal for my business, cheaper than my renewal and fixed for 3 years.Very helpful and prompt with times for calling me back.Will be calling them next year when my gas contract is up for renewal.
3737|Operative was extremely formative and helpfulwould definitely recommend!
3738|Having spoken to my original energy supplier, they were very unhelpful as to how and when I could retrieve back credit that had built up with them, via direct debit payments.I spoke to my nominated energy consultant who took specific details of my file and problem that I had, within 2 hours, he had called my original energy company, spoken to another enery consultant, sorted out my file for a refund of monies owing and took contact details for her for myself so that I could contact her and complete the refund transaction.He called me back personally, with correct and helpful information such as a direct extension number, specific name of the person I was to talk with who had dealt with my file, and by the end of my conversation with her, the original energy company agreed to send a cheque in the post.All together a very helpful and proffesional consultant who is a credit to the company and helped me out no end in a problem that he solved quuickly and efficiently.  Would definately recommend.
3739|Job done  and recommended to friends looking forward to the next few years
3740|Having phoned around all the major energy companies to get quotes for my contract that was running out, utility wise was able to come up with as good a deal as I was offered but for 3 years instead of just a one year deal.They canceled my existing supplier for me as well which all helps. The telephone operator I had was helpful and extremely pleasant. I will use them for my other 9 sites when the contracts end.
3741|Managed to get a good price on my gas for 5 years. Only just signed up with them and issued termination of contract with current supplier but so far the experience has been relatively pain free and the rates after a bit of negotiation beat all other suppliers.Good that they have been proactive and keen for the business but not too pushy.
3742|Utilitywise made easy work of finding the most competitive rates from various electricity suppliers. No need to examine each and every available scheme on the market, just a 'one-stop-shop'.
3743|Very helpful answered my questions, returned calls promtly. Staff were friendly and kept me informed at all times. Made the process of finding the best price simple and uncomplicated.
3744|The staff members were friendly and called back when asked.I did not feel pressurised an any time.A very good service.
3745|We as a company have used Utilitywise's services for the last 3 years for both our Gas & Electricity. They provide us with a seemless service on renewal, options available & general account administration. We have DIRECT contact that has never changes that I feel is very important, rather than just dealing will a call centre where nobody has a real understanding of your needs. Long may this serviced continue, i have recommended them to a number of businesses that we have close relationships with. 
3746|Renegotiation of power contract carried out efficiently and cost effectively.Follow up and all matters discussed clearly and promptly in a very pleasant but business like manner.Felt great confidence that the member of staff dealing my contract knew what he was talking about and could deliver.He followed the issues through and got me a very good deal and solution to my power provider worries.I can't fault the service and I am very pleased to have had the opportunity of doing business with Utilitywise.
3747|I am pleased to have been educated a little more about energy prices and also have someone look into the best business rates on my behalf.  The member of staff was very knowledgable and patient with my questions!She got me the best rates which was reduced even further just upon signing up. I was unaware that I could be entitled to such good rates that are protected for a few years from prices rise which I was assured would be the norm going forward.
3748|They do what they say they will do and appear to have saved us money! What else is there to say!
3749|utilitywise were very thorough in assessing our requirements and explained in detail the contract that they were recommending to us
3750|Utilitywise take care of a few of our contracts and I have also recommended them to another business and would do so again. They are very helpful, friendly and always find a good deal.  Would definately be happy to recommend.
3751|My contact kept in regular contact and kept me appraised of all the changes made along the way. At no point did I feel overly pressured to do the deal.
3752|Helpful and sorted out my utility services without any fuss. 
3753|rely gud servacs i feel like she has rely went them extra mile 4 me rely apprechiate evrythink xxxxxxxxx
3754|When I was contacted by Utility Wise the whole process was quick and easy.  They did all the comparisons, were always there to handle any queries and I would definitely recommend them to other colleagues.   The whole process was very smooth.
3755|Utilitywise provide a great service - they take all the pain out of sourcing the best value energy contracts. I'll never have to do it myself again - hurrah! The Consultant I usually talk to is very knowledgeable, always does as he promises and is very nice to talk to - he makes it all very easy. Thank you!
3756|Information was clearly explained to me as I was a little cautious after previous problems with energy suppliers James was very cheerful and helpful also understood that I was busy at the time of first contact and rearranged. Would recommend. 
3757|No problems  went smoothly  h e was a pleasure to work with and would recommend him to others Thanks
3758|Employee was extremely helpful on the telephone and very very friendly and polite.  Kept informed by telephone at each stage.  Discussed thoroughly my options.
3759|I have been dealing with Michael Avery at Utilitywise for many years now and have found him and the company most efficient. I always check on other company rates and can never find a better price than what he has offered. Occassional problems that have arisen in the past have always been solved with his help. I have no problem with recommending this company,
3760|I was contacted by Utilitywise last year to source better prices for our gas and electricity.  During all my conversations and negotiations the same person has dealt with us consistently. The transitions went smoothly with Utilitywise checking that we were happy.  Utilitywise seem to do what the customer cannot and that is get us better prices per unit.  Many thanks
3761|From start to the end great service and delivered all what was promised in the time frame agreed.Utilitywise have saved us money by sourcing the best deal, not to mention the savings in time and effort.
3762|I have been dealing with Utilitywise for a few years now and they are always friendly, positive and knowledgeable. Energy transfers are always simple and issues with transfers are dealt with in a professional manner. Once a new contract is in place the management of the contract is taken care of leaving you to concentrate on your business. Their service is far  beyond the rivals. They are a complete package broker that won't dissappear once you have signed up. I would definitely recommend using their services.
3763|A very helpful and client focused organisation.A great source of expertise regarding the energy supply market, that procured our company an excellent deal on our electricity contract.Have more recently tapped into other parts of the organisation and am very happy with the progress being made in the energy efficiency & renewables assistance provided to date.
3764|Utility wise approached us to renew our utility contract. They found a cheaper deal and switch supplier for us. It was easy, saved us money, a no brainer.
3765|We have 4 meters on 2 sites and to date have always dealt directly with energy suppliers when contracts came up for renewal. We currently have 2 suppliers and for the 4 meters each renewal date was different - our renewal process was time-consuming and complex.Utilitywise contacted us and after some initial discussions they negotiated deals with one energy supplier with fixed rate deals all having the same renewal date. The process is far simpler and well worth the time to provide the necessary information etc. The people I dealt with at utilitywise are friendly and give you confidence they are working for your benefit. They provided information promptly and explained everything in detail.I do have one issue, when Utilitywise first got in touch with me I had several people from different departments contacting me regarding our requirements. I found this frustrating having to explain we were already in talks with Utilitywise. 
3766|Very polite service and follow up calls and good rates achieved. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.
3767|I have been dealing with Utility wise for the supply of our electric over a few of our companies. I have been impressed by there professionalism from taking an inquiry, sourcing best companies & rates that suit our busines needs.One man who has been there to help me over the years is James McNaney, he is superb at his job, is helpful, very knowledgeable & deals with everything thrown at him in a very professional manner.

3768|The staff at Utilitywise were extremely helpful and professional and a pleasure to deal with throughout.  They managed to get me a great deal on my electricity and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to someone if a contact of mine asked if I'd dealt with any companies in this area.
3769|The team at Utility Wise were extremely helpful and efficient when helping me decide which electricity contract was right for my company and very quick at responding to any questions or queries that i had.They were also very good at processing the contract that i decided to go with and made the whole end process completely hassle free.Superb company and wouldn't hesitate to use them again.
3770|Utilitywise take the strain of finding the right supplier with the right price for your utilities, saving you time and money. Staff are friendly and efficient, doing exactly what they say they will do. What more could you ask for. I will definitely recommend their services.
3771|I found Utility Wise so easy to use, the staff made everything very straight forward and lead me step by step through the process.  I would highly recommend them.
3772|Never miss an end of contract deadline again! Once Utilitywise have the details of all of the supplies you are currently juggling they renegotiate on your behalf to get the best price, remind you in advance that a contract is  up for renewal and let you get on with what you do best.
3773|I have been delighted with the service from the first telephone contact to the final result. The agent was professional and courteous without being intrusive;  always calling at a convenient time.I am delighted with the savings and cannot recommend highly enough. 
3774|Very happy with the service provided
3775|Its great that they take everything off your hands so you don't have to waste time searching round for the cheapest prices and they will let you know when your contract comes up for renewal. This is great for me as we are extremely busy so struggle to find time to do this.Also very friendlyThankyou!
3776|Good advise given in the supply of electricity for our business, Friendly and also available to consult with different rate available 
3777|I thoroughly recommend dealing with Utilitywise, they were efficient, courteous and helpful at all times.  They saved us a considerable amount of money and, as a charity, every penny is a prisoner.   They are definately worth a try.Fiona McRobertsVolunteer Support and Development Workerfiona@ab-rc.org.uk
3778|The caller was informative and pleasant. He explained every aspectof the procedure to me clearly and answered my questions confidently.
3779|The consultant is a charming and helpful advisor. He is always willing to help and can be relied upon to deal with issues promptly, thus taking any stress away from the customer. I would definitely recommend him to anybody.
3780|My new pub restaurant venture needed to set up gas and electric accounts. I personally find the utility market a very complicated area to deal with. Utility wise have changed all that with expert advice and support. My account manager has literally taken all the worry of the utility nightmare away ... I can honestly say that heGives me first class support .. Thank you From a very satisfied customer.
3781|I have found utility wise to be very efficient and prompt in organising the set up of our electricity and gas accounts, of which we have 6.I would recommend them to another business.
3782|Fast, efficient and very polite service. 
3783|I am treasurer of a committee which oversees the running of a large village hall on a non profit basis. Consequently control of energy costs are crucial to us. My contact at Utilitywise has dealt with all my queries in a friendly, helpful and clear manner always getting back to me as promised. As a committee we wanted the best rates possible for electricity and gas fixed over a number of years so that we have a greater idea of our expenses for a longer period. I was sent details of various options clearly outlined so we could make an informed decision. We now have a dual energy contract we are very satisfied with and are very impressed with the service we have received.   
3784|We have used Utilitywise to help source the best deal for our energy and they have beaten our renewal quote every time. Great people to work with. Thanks.
3785|very friendly and kept me informed all the way.there is not much more i have to say, polite members of your staff, to many telephone calls at one stage, they have to take into consideration that alot of places they ring are one man bands and cant be avalible to take there telephone calls
3786|UtilityWise have helped me enormously with finding cheaper rates for our properties. They are always on the ball with calling in plenty of time to remind me to sort out new rates and are very efficient and courteous.Happy to recommend.
3787|I have had some very good 3 year quotes from Utilitywise and am pleased that this will benefit the charity and help with our budgeting.  Utilitywise were rather persistent but this was good because I am always very busy and would not have got the quotes sorted if they had not kept ringing!  I was also not aware that quotes could be obtained for contracts ending several months ahead and that I could get a better deal thinking that far ahead.
3788|we have been working with our Account Manager for several years and found him to be really friendly & helpful, co-operative a very nice man to work with.
3789|Hi we were very happy with the way you sorted out our electric etc, Brian Cook
3790|discussed options for tarrifs and agrredsterms, follow up calls to confirm were fast efficient.  friendly service, quick to get back to us when leaving message by email or phone!.
3791|Have always received an excellent service from Utilitywise and have been with them for a number of years Our account manager has been an absoloute ambassador for the organisation. His professionalism and manner have been exemplorary.
3792|A friendly and reliable service, the staff were very helpful and made the whole process very swift and easy. Thank you so much!
3793|A very easy process to get through, my contact who updates me regulary is a pleasure to deal with.I would reccomend them as I have done to others.
3794|I am dealing with Utilitywise as my boker for electricity and gas contract for thepast 3-4 years.My account manager always prompty replies and givesme multiple lternatves with prices ncluding 1,2 and 3 years contract pricing.Also does the saving calculation for me to make my decesion making easier.Highly recommended company. Hoping to deal with tem fo a long whil still
3795|Our dedicated accounts manager provided a very friendly, but professional approach to our company's energy needs. Although we chose to go to a supplier direct, I would certainly recommend Utilitywise as being a more stress-free way to find the best energy deal. 
3796|For years I have had him search for the best prices on Electricity contracts and have been more than happy with the service received from the company. I have always searched for best prices, as well as the service received from Utilitywise and if any price that I have found to be better has been matched by Utilitywise, whether it be with another company or even the same company. I understand Utilitywise have relationships with energy suppliers to enable these discounted prices which are always great for a company saving money!
3797|Very helpful and took all the hassle and worry out of changing supplier.
3798|The service I received was very good and I found the staff very helpful and friendly when I changed gas suppliers. 
3799|The service has been very good and I would recommend you to family and friends. The newsletters are informative.I like being kept up to date and informed.I don`t much like having to read the meters monthly with Total Gas and Power
3800|I have been pleased with the service provided in the last 18 months.  It was particularly helpful to be able to avoid the standing charge for gas, given the low usage.  I find it very straightforward to provide meter readings on line and have no adverse comment to make.  The staff member has been particularly helpful in all my dealings with him so far.  I feel it's a bit early for me to give a 5 star rating at this time.
3801|Utilitywise changed my supplier with no fuss and no drama. Found me a good deal and more importantly saved us money.
3802|Normally I do not entertain cold callers in my business, my attitude to them is why are you wasting my time. This call was different, the callers voice was distinct, interesting, friendly and relaxed which enticed me to listen and find out more about the company and the product that was being being offered, his open and honest answers to my questions were enlightening and encouraging and resulted in me signing up to what I now consider to be a very good deal with Total Gas & Power. What a pleasure it was to deal with a young sales person who was not pushy or aggressive and took the time to treat me as a friend that was only a email or telephone call away if I had any concerns or queries.Thanks to the young person who contacted me, I am a happy customer and well done to Utility Wise for employing staff of this nature, this person is certainly an asset to your company and I look forward to dealing with your company in the future.
3803|Utilitywise assist us with the management and control of the electricity and gas supplies at seven different sites for over four years.  They have secured good conract rates from their recommended suppliers and have been of great assistance in dealing with the incompetence of the various utility supply companies. Our account manager has always been available  at reasonable notice to help us resolve a whole range of problems which have arisen with changes of tenant and his involvement appears to give us greater credibility with the suppliers.    
3804|I have found utility wise very helpful,since contracting with them have had no issues and if ever I had any questions always found them very obliging and willing to helpGot us some great deals on pricingAlways a very courteous and pleasant telephone mannerAdvice always available We receive calls regular to ensure we are still happy with the serviceWould definitely recommend their services
3805|We have received a fantastic service from the consultant I would recommend him.
3806|Very efficient and aware of the markets relevant to our business.Friendly and succeeded in building up a level of trust necessary to develop a working partnership.Would not hesitate to recommend to other micro businesses in our field.
3807|Utilitywise have been our energy consultants for 3 years and have kept us well informed of energy tariffs.  We rely on our energy consultant to keep us up to date with the best offers and company suppliers.
3808|We have been using utilitywise for a few years now. I would recommend them in an instant to anyone. We had an advisor deal with our accounts & he was so helpful in every way. Going above what was required of him a++ company & a++ staff
3809|Having spent many hours trying to sort out the best deals on Electricity providers we found Utilitywise they have been very proactive in sorting out our supplier with savings both in time and money.We are very happy with there continued support.
3810|WE WERE ASSITED BY THE ADVISOR WHOWAS VERY GOOD AND HELPED US WITH EVERYTHING REQUIRED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS AND WOULD RECOMEND TO OTHER PARTIES IN THE FUTURE
3811|The advisor originally contacted me regarding our Electricity, thank God he did. He made everything so easy to understand and is very helpful. I'd recommend every one to use him and this company.
3812|Very reliable and easy to contact. All problems are resolved amicably.Very good service.
3813|Utilitywise have been sourcing the best electricity & gas prices for my guest house for over 4 years, and the consultant has always been most efficient in sorting any problems that occur with the suppliers. I have many other companies try to take my business from him & Utilitywise, but I would not change whilst they continue to trade. I have recommended them to all of my hotelier colleagues.
3814|I find this a very helpful service.  It makes my life a lot easier as i do not have to go to every supplier to get the comparisons.  We have now dealt with you for 3/4 years. The replies are always prompt and easy to deal with.An excellent service.
3815|Utiltywise always give a friendly service with quick responses and immediate action. Quick to answer any questions and resolve any issues you may have. Always seem to be looking at the market going forward and advising accordingly. Feel safe in the knowledge they are watching your back !! Best move we ever made.
3816|I have dealt with the advisor for a number of years now and would have no hesitation in recommending his services to anybody. He is always confident of what he is saying and provides good information for me without over complicating the issue. A number of other companies have approached me over the time I have been with him and I have always opted to remain with him. The only criticism I would make, and it is very minor, is that the volume of work he has can sometimes detract from the accuracy. The only example I have was a recent phone call when it became apparent that information he had taken from an in-house computer programme had not been loaded correctly and gave incorrect information to him. Prior to purchasing our gas & electricity contracts I received as much information as I needed to make an informed decision. I cannot speak highly enough of him and would happily recommend him to other prospective clients.
3817|We have a lot of different electricity and gas supplies to various sites.  Utilitywise have negotiated a good rate,  placed them all with one supplier and made it so that the contracts all end at the same time making it a lot easier to manage.
3818|Hi the company found the right products and good price for us when we took over 5 new sites. I would recommend them to others
3819|The consultant does all the hard work so you don't have to. Lets keep pushing utility companies on price.
3820|When first contacted by Utilitywise i though here we go again as i get so many sales calls all making out they can save us money but Utilitywise aren't like all these others and actually can save you money. The service provided is always helpful and of a high standard and their knowledge in this area is impressive. If you are keen to save money on you gas/electricity or structure your bills so you know where you are then let Utilitywise see what they can do for you. 
3821|I found Utilitywise vey helpful and informative during my search for a new supplier of our Gas provider they got me a very good deal in terms of price. I hope that the change over will go as smooth and be as painless as i hoped. When my Electricity is due for renewal i hope they can be as productive and get us the right deal. I hope they will be able to follow through on the guarantee they give me about sorting out any problem i have in the future
3822|I am extremely happy with their service and would be happy to recommend them to others
3823|Easiest thing I have ever done, fast efficient friendly service, all points clarified and explained, thoroughly recommend anyone coming to the end of their contract should speak to these people, after years of shoddy service and nightmare suppliers at last someone who knows their stuff, thank you utility wise
3824|I would recommend Utilitywise due to the progessional and friendly service I have always received from them.
3825|Excellent service from a local company.Good to have their expertise available for consultation and for helping to reduce energy costs.
3826|Utilitywise made the entire process extremely easy and the member of staff who was dealing with my electricity supply was not only friendly and unbelievably helpful it was although she really cared that I was getting the best deal. The personable service and the time taken to explain things clearly, jargon free, was an absolute breath of fresh air. In the current climate when looking after your money is king, it was truly fantastic to have someone there to help you rather than pushy sales people trying to trick you into something that was not all that it seemed. I have already recommended this service to several of my colleagues and friends and I will continue to do so if this topic of conversation crops up. Brilliant!
3827|We were very happy with the service Utilitywise provided.  When we moved premises, we had to set up new contracts with gas and electric suppliers.  They took all the hard work out of the process by finding the best prices (we obtained a couple of other quotes to compare with) and setting up the contracts and direct debits for us.  We had issues with one of our meters which they also resolved.  Any queries we've had have been responded to quickly and whenever we phone, there's no time wasted having to wait listening to on-hold music. The friendly and helpful service has been particularly appreciated as this is often where other companies miss the mark.
3828|I found Utilitywise to offer a great service, very professional nd helpful and really try to get the best price for my business.
3829|I dealt with a lady. She covered everything in great detail, nothing too much trouble, very good communication and very approachable.The process of putting in a new electricity supply was made easy.
3830|I found utilitywise to be very professional, competitive on price and their customer service is fantastic 
3831|We have used Utility Wise for a couple of years and found them very helpful and friendly.  They do all the hard work and manage to get great deals without all the hassle.
3832|Great service. staff are on the ball an sort any problems as soon as they arise.
3833|They are really professional, service they do is so good it is outstanding and so easy to work with. They do all the hard job for you. In another words finding the cheapest provider for Gas and Electricity. They do all the contracts and all the hard talk for you. I found the person who introduce the Utility wise to me really nice, friendly and trustful that's why i went with them. We are Stone fabricators (Mario Marble and Granite Ltd)and we needed a company like this for long time to guide us and always be up to date with the prices from the Companies that truing to rip you off when your contract finishes. Again i will say thank you guys and kip it up. Regards Zoran Vidovski Manager Director Mario Marble and Granite
3834|After receiving a call from James Lambert-Parker I was pessimistic as to what Utilitywise could do for us. How wrong I was. Great service and saved us a great deal of money as well as time.Great, friendly, informal service from James who we will definitely continue to deal with.
3835|I would recommend Utilitywise. They are a very friendly company who are always striving to do their best for their clients. They answer your queries straight away and it has been a pleasure doing business with them
3836|I have always experienced a friendly approach in my dealings with Utilitywise and a desire by them to be helpful, without being too pushy. Unlike some others in the same marketplace! 
3837|Excellent all round service, delightful company to deal with, would deffinatley reccomend :-) 
3838|Very helpful in sorting out our energy contracts.
3839|Great friendly service - has taken out all the hassle of renewing energy supply. Would definitely recommend Utilitywise and will use again when my current contract expires!!!!
3840|Good sales person, fairly persistent and I did change suppliers. However very disappointed with the new supplier, as with all big companies, they sign you up and then have no interest in you. The advisor says she is going to try and sort it out so let's hope.
3841| A really good support service for our company in terms of ensuring we get the best available deal on our electricity & gas supply prices. Furthermore they can also bring additional aspects to the table aimed to reduce our energy consumption at key sites - we have had our head office surveyed including the production of an energy certificate. Their agents comments have stimulated an active review of our expenditure on electricity & we have pursued some of their suggestions on minimising consumption. With their help we are moving to an optimised position of minimal energy consumption being charged at the most favourable unit price - we could not have achieved this as readily or as quickly on our own. Thank  you energywise - I am happy to commend you to other companies out there! When are you going to offer the same degree of support to domestic clients - I will be first in that queue!
3842|Normally I put the phone down on people trying to get us to change telephone or electric suppliers, but I'm pleased to have not done so this time.The whole process was  simple and painless, and tailored to our particular requirements. Our current contract does not expire until August 2014, so final impressions will have to wait until the transfer, but at time of writing I'm very pleased with the service from Utilitywise. Thanks to James.
3843| I was happy with the service i received from this company. They were efficient and kept me informed of process. They did not harass me to make a desicion and helped me when cancelling my current contract
3844|Been using Utility Wise for a few years and they always come up with the best deals. Keep up the good work.
3845|I was very impressed by the girl who found a good deal for us in our bid to change our power supplier. She was very helpful, explained everything very clearly, was friendly and her on-going attention has been admirable.  This girl did not sound as if she were reading from a pre-written script as with some call centre staff and certainly made me feel that our business was important to her company.I would recommend Utility Wise to others based purely on the attention I received and hopefully our new supplier will live up to our expectations.
3846|Great compnay to have as a contact and always very helpful to clear up any queries to make the switching process simpler, would recommend Darren Allpure Filters Ltd 
3847|The consultant met expectations and provided useful advice. We sought advice from another consultant who didn't compare anywhere near as well as Emerson at Utilitywise. the price didn't come back favourably so we went with our previous supplier but Emerson was honest enough to say they couldn't find anything to compete.
3848|Explained all factors in plain English, were personal and friendly and efficient, and felt they were genuinely unbiased. 
3849|I contacted Utilitywise yesterday regarding a gas supply to an industrial unit and within twenty four hours they have happily switched my supplier with a saving of about 50%.    This is the second time we have used this company and I am very impressed with the person who dealt with our enquiry on both occasions.  He was clear and concise and very efficient.Thank you James
3850|Supply contracts covering a range of sites were re-negotiated to have the same contract end date, better (fixed) prices and I only had to deal with one person (instead of lots of different suppliers). Very easy to do business with and would recommend them.
3851|Emmerson, has been a great support in switching over our two companies multipliable sites. Always on hand for support or any questions we may have. Thank you! Alison Finch Cephas Care Ltd & Alpha Nurseries Ltd
3852|It's been a good experience in doing business with you.Simple and detailed explanation.Professional attitude.Would like to recommend to everybody I know.
3853|With the expected cost increase on Electricity Utilitywise were proactive and looked forward in advance so we could secure a better price.The account manager was very helpful as always!
3854|I found the whole process to be simple and painless with the advice given being understandable and given in a none pressure manner.
3855|Very pleased with the transition between electricity supplier. I was kept up to date with all stages of the process. The only hiccup encountered was after the transition when direct debits weren't set up, incurring extra charges which I'm still trying to recover.
3856|The process was very easy from start to finish. Very efficient and I got a great price.  All I had to do was send a copy of a utility bill and sign a letter of authorization. Utility Wise did all the rest. Thank you.
3857|On contacting utility wise for price quotes for my electricity supply I was pleased to be helped by Daniell Whitton one of their sales advisors. It was immediately apparent that she knew the energy market well and after taking some past usage details she found me an excellent tariff fixed for three years. I was pleasantly surprised by how knowledgeable, helpful and polite she was. I am certainly going to use utility wise when this existing deal expires. 
3858|I was very impressed with the gentleman who advised and assisted me in our discussion in respect of my search for a suitable energy supplier for my business. Everything was explained in clear language to me, and I fully understood the process that was to be undertaken. Utilitywise searched for the best deal that would suit my business, and I was able to enter into a suitable contract at a good price for my electricity, just at a time when energy prices were about to soar throughout. They have saved me time and money. It was also useful to learn about other ways I can save on my energy usage, with ideas I can apply in both my business and home.
3859|The staff member I dealt with was extremley helpful answered all questions confidentley. A very good service was provided.
3860|Was Kept well up to date with the progress when we recently had to renew our Electricity contract . Would certainly recommend Utility Wise 
3861|Excellent customer service , very professional and helpful.Listened to our energy needs and managedto secure my company a very good deal .Would definitely recommend. 
3862|Great Customer Service, i would recommend this to friends and family. It is Great Value for money, Great help and advise and reassurance. Overall an impressive service. 
3863|I've had good experiences from UtilityWise. They have been able to offer better energy procurement services than other energy brokers I'd previously used, by (a) grouping my energy needs with those of other SME businesses when going to the market, (b) locking in rates up to 12 months in advance of contract end dates, and (c) securing longer term contracts.In addition, they are providing an FOC energy audit which should help to bring my costs down still further through driving energy efficiencies.All in all, my experiences of the company to date have all been positive.
3864|The agent worked very hard for me and obtained the best deal for my business. She was very efficient and friendly.
3865|Running a business requires having an eye on many aspects of financial control. One of the important ones and often the most time consuming is keeping control of power supply costs as they fluctuate enormously, mostly upwards.Having UtilityWise doing this work helps me manage my time better and I can relax because I know my power bills are under control.The staff that I have been in contact with have been polite, efficient and helpful.
3866|This company went out and found us a really good deal on electricity and within a few weeks we were saving money every time we opened up the office. We just provided details of what we paid already, how much energy we used and who our supplier was.  The rest was over to them- Excellent service with a great result. I would definitely recommend Utilitywise to do the same for your company. 
3867|Utilitywise found a new supplier for our 3 units for both gas and electric and they have saved us over GBP3k per year! The advisor has been very helpfull with the transfer of suppliers!
3868|Great service, friendly and efficient staff who do what they say they will do, and they get great rates for gas & electricity!
3869|very helpful staffvery helpful staff
3870|I received a random call from Utility wise, initially I thought mmm another supplier selling a cheaper deal than anyone else.  I've been really impressed by the initial support and continued support from this company, they don't actually supply Gas or Electricity which means they have an open review on all the utility suppliers.  I've received a great deal, I'll continue to use them, yes I'd recommend them to my friends and fellow colleagues. A great job done, for a small business its like having your own utilities department, a representative on hand with their own email for any questions you may have. My advice - go for it! 
3871|FIRSTLY I ALMOST DIDN'T TAKE THE CALL BECAUSE AS A BUSINESS WE GET A LOAD OF COLD CALLERS WHICH GENERALLY ARE A WASTE OF SPACE.  LUCKILY FOR YOUR ORGANISATION THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AND HOPEFULLY MONEY WILL BE SAVED FOR OUR BUSINESS ON UTILITIES AND BOY DOES IT TAKE THE STRAIN WHEN YOU ARE ALSO MOVING OFFICE! SECONDLY YOUR MEMBER OF STAFF WAS HELPFUL, EASY TO SPEAK TO AND GAVE ME CONFIDENCE IN HANDING OVER THE REIGNS IN THIS AREA; SHE CARRIED OUT ALL OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO WHICH SERVICE PROVIDER WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR US HOWEVER AS YET WE HAVE TO SEE THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING! THIRDLY THERE WAS A DOWNSIDE IN THAT PROVIDING THE INFORMATION TOOK QUITE SOMETIME AND HAS TO SOME EFFECT MADE ME BEHIND WITH MY WORK BUT IT COULD ALSO BE THE TIMING OF THE CONTACT. LASTLY IF INDEED WE DO SAVE MONEY OVERTIME THEN IT IS A BONUS BUT TO BE HONEST WHY HAVE I NOT HEARD ABOUT YOUR COMPANY BEFORE?
3872|excellent customer service from one particulary lady in newcastle office always willing to help assist me in any matter and always very polite,and helped us along the way as we are very busy people running our own business so sometimes things took a little longer to  sort out/complete but she was very patient with us.everything has gone completly well with the change over from our old supplier britsh gas.we would recomend your company in the future 
3873|LYNXprojects Ltd has recently been dealing with Utility wise. Our experience has been first class, mainly due to the level of commitment shown for getting a job done, in the most courteous and can do fashion. Although our trading relationship is essentially embryonic, Utility wise has seen the value in our business due to the work we do and tried at all stages to keep momentum. All in all I would not hesitate to both commend them as UK business brand ambassadors and recommend them to others. Darren Walsh Managing Director LYNXprojects Ltd. 
3874|Very professional and dealt with changing over to a different provider very easy.
3875|The service I received from utilitywise was fantastic from start to finish. I dealt with the same sales person throughout who was very informative and helpful. He understood as a charity that we were looking for the best terms and pricing to consolidate our energy supplies and he found them. He answered all my questions and kept in contact with all updates as they occurred. Dealing with the same person is very reassuring and another really good element to this organisation. I would certainly recommend them to friends and other organisations.
3876|Once we had agreed to the service our needs were listened to and dealt with in an efficient and professional way.Thank you
3877|Very pleases with the overall service. Good clear advise given by sales staff who highlighted the benifits and the savings but above all were not pushy for a sale . Job well done
3878|We have had great service from your company. The rates are good and in line with what we expect to pay over 5 years. James was persistent in acquiring the sale, but also very friendly and his explanations were clear and concise without being patronising or rushed. We would recommend this service. thank you.
3879|A good experience. they guided us through the process & kept in contact so we did not feel out of control of the situation, yet there was no pressure to complete the deal. We feel that we have got a good service & the best deal. We will certainly recommend the service to others & use it again our selvesin the future.       
3880|I have been dealing with James Murphy who has been most helpful in finding me great Utility rates for our business. I am still working with him but would definitely use Utility wise again. Many thanks Katie
3881|Utility wise provide a thoroughly professional service in all aspects of business and have helped us consistently reduce our energy spending year upon year.We happily intend to continue using their services for the foreseeable future.
3882|My experiences with Utilitywise have been positive from the outset. I have a good relationship with the partner channel and have found the customer service to be of a high standard. I would have no qualms recommending this company to my friends and family. 
3883|We have found the whole process very helpful.  Information required is straightforward as is the information we receive.  Staff are always available to talk to on the telephone and respond to emails quickly.We would have no hesitation in recommending this company to others, as in fact we have. 
3884|I spoke to a gentlemen at utilitywise. Who looked at our energy contracts we were in the last year of our current contracts on both meters. The advisor managed to find us a 5 yr fixed contract at a lower rate than our current contract. In the current climate I found this an offer to good to turn down. Thank you utilitywise for a job well done.
3885|Our Partner Channel Energy consultant acted quickly and professionally and secured our company Motorhog Limited long term contracts with great rates. We have been trying to get all our bills from different sites onto one bill for some time but the individual energy companies we contacted didn't offer this service. Highly recommended
3886|I had the pleasure of receiving a phone call from this company at a time I was confused with the deals on offer. I spoke to a member of staff who explained everything to us so that it was easy to understand, not only were they friendly and professional they placed no pressure upon us. The follow ups have been great aswell so well done all.Very Happy 
3887|The only service i have use where they did not try to get me to change my suppler just said i had the best deal thank for all your help S.Fawthrop 
3888|The advisor was very helpful and the information he gave was concise and clear. His friendly manner, not too pushy, also contributed in making my choice for my office. I would rate 5* Can't give a review on value for money until the first bill arrives.
3889|A very friendly, professional and efficient service was provided. All information was presented in a customer friendly manner and any additional information requested was provided in a timely manner.
3890|I have a really good relationship with our agent at UtilityWise, my questions get answered promptly. We have got value for money with keen prices quoted.the transfer from one supplier to another went very well.I have recommended you to my family and friends. 
3891|The staff I have dealt with have always been very polite and have always returned calls etc. They are very keen to find a good deal and to get you signed up. There have been no problems so far with changing suppliers. I hope that I have made a good decision and that I will not regret it, but only time will tell.
3892|Initially, Utilitywize gave me a straightforward price comparison that was simple to follow and made my review process quick and straight forward. Since then they have always provided timely information for me to make informed decisions which have lead to vast financial savings on our energy costs.  They are a great company to work with as I can get on with the rest of my job knowing with the confidence that they are watching the markets in our interests.  
3893|I have dealt with a consultant at Utilitywise in 2 roles now and have been very impressed by the professional, helpful and friendly service I received on both occasions, not to mention the savings and value for money service. I would have no hesitation in recommending Utilitywise again.
3894|as the previous tenants of the property we took over  left without paying their bill, the premises were  de-energised by the most unhelpful supplier you could imagine. Utility wise guided us through the process to get the property re-energised and we now have the power back on.we were kept informed throughout the process by the professional team at Utility wise.
3895|I have been delighted with the response from Utilitywise. not only did I same on current costs, I was also able to agree pricing for future costs ....(36 months) and with costs rising rapidly i estimate savings of @30%....no unexpected surprises which is great. There have been many companies who have contacted me in Northern Ireland, but none able to offer such substantial and in-depth savings.
3896|I was made to feel very comfortable and everything was made very clear from the outset. Calls were returned when requested and the relevant information always available. I would have no hesitation in recommending Utility Wise in the future.
3897|Detail were explain clearly, but  on phone I feel it  is very long, it is one of the way to save cost
3898|I recently had the opportunity to use Utility Wise to source a new energy deal for my shop. Our Partner Channel Energy consultant was extremely patient and never pushy with me (unlike a number of other phone calls that i received) when i couldn't return documents as quickly as I would have liked and then acted quickly and professionally to secure our company Moto Plus Ltd a long term contract with great rates. Very highly recommended.
3899|Our company was very pleased with the quality of the service provided. We sincerely appreciate your helpfulness and the way your company conducts the business. We will definitely recommend your services to other companies, as you provide the invaluable help in managing the energy efficiency, procurement, and consumption.We look forward to doing business with you in future. 
3900|'Utilitywise' came over our electricity supply horizon perhaps ten years ago. They find the best tariffs for our three disparate sites - for the appropriate term, be that six months , or three years.Thanks to smart meters we now have more trust in direct debit mandates. There are now very large companies who profess to offer their suppliers access to preferential tariffs, and so adding another line to the spectrum of quotations.Although website utility quotations can look inviting, they are often short term with cancellation fees.  Utilitywise consistently find the right contracts without taking a fee from us. It all adds up to a useful shortcut.
3901|The company is very happy with service utilitywise has provided. We have saved ourselves a substantioal amount of money! I would recommend this service to anybody.Utilty wise choose the best options and services that our company required.
3902|Very satisfied with all aspects of serviceCouldn't ask for anything more. Thank you Utilitywise. 
3903|I first dealt with this firm about 12 months ago and used them to find the best electricity prices for our church. They were extremely helpful and sorted out all the problems with both the past supplier and the new one. They also keep in touch with me to see if they can save us more money.I am altogether very satisfied.
3904|We were impressed that were impressed that we were contacted well in advance of our contract termination date and were secured excellent rates taking into account the increases that have been advised recently. We have used Utility wise for a couple of years now and they have produced the goods
3905|Since using Utilitywise dealing with the ever changing, ever increasing, time consuming task of dealing with electricity contracts on multipe sites has been a doddle.  They are very efficient with knowledgeable staff meaning I can get on with what I do best!
3906|Found Utilitywise very helpful & informative. Quick to respond with most competetive prices. Pricing was clear from the outset. Just a couple of forms to sign and return. Changing supplier was quick and easy. 
3907|The service I have had with utilitywise has been outstanding, I would highly recommd them to others. The agent I spoke to has gone above and beyond my expectations. Thank you
3908|A member of this company cold called me but for once a very helpful cold call it was! He wasn't pushy or annoying, just very helpful and knowledgeable about finding the best gas deal possible. He worked really hard, always doing what he said he was going to do and ringing when he said he was going to. He even managed to point out we had previously been billed incorrectly by our current supplier so we actually got a substantial rebate back from them! I would definitely recommend this company to anyone wanting to find the best deal.
3909|"Utilitywise has helped our clients with fantastic savings on their energy bills by using their place in the market and expertise, enhancing our relationship with  our clients and providing an excellent service.  By going ""that extra mile"" we have managed to secure extra work from our clients and cemented our reputation in the industry."
3910|I have found Utillitywise to be very professional, the transfer from my old supplier went very smoothly and our relationship looks as if it will be a long one with us making substantial savings over the coming years.
3911|I would highly Utilitywise. The gentleman I dealt with is an excellent Energy Consultant and always provides a top level service. 
3912|Having dealt with Utility Wise in previous Years, I went with another company that were suppose to move my Electricity & Gas to other suppliers, was a mistake, Never transferred them over and stuck with higher rate for the next 12 months, will be back next year as I know the transfer will be done right, Wont make that mistake again,
3913|Very friendly and easy to work with.
3914|I have found they are helpful in reviewing my bills and coming up with quotes promptly. They are good in keeping in touch by phone and e-mail at a time that suits my diary. Bills are so complicated that it is good to have an advisor who knows his way round them and give good advice. I would recommend them to my friends. 
3915|just used utilitywise to help me out of a mega pickle with a broker which left me in a pickle with a certain energy company,their service and commitment were second to none and everything was explained easily and understandablethey constantly kept in touch with the progress reports by phone and email and the 2 lads i dealt with were first classall in all great service
3916|I found the person who contacted me to be very helpful and kept me fully informed at every stage. She made changing suppliers quick and simple and it is good to know that everything will be taken care of in the future. I have already recommended her to another church looking for assistance.
3917|I found Curtis to be efficient and helpful throughout the process. I have savings in place and hopefully a budget I can work with. I would recommend at least a consultation to establish the savings that can be achieved. Thanks again Ray 
3918|Good explanation in breakdown of costs, but staff need to tone down the harassing phone calls and e-mails. I explained on numerous occasions that we needed time to think and were aware of prices increasing on a daily basis, but the calls and e-mails continued.  Bit frustrating! 
3919|Utilitywise have provided an excellent service to date.  Their specialists operate with the highest standards of professionalism and have delivered excellent value in my dealings with them to date.  5 Star service..
3920|I have been dealing with Utility Wise for several years,they give a professional service and have taken awaythe stress of finding the provider for gas and electric for our four units.I am not only pleased with the prices they have obtainedbut also the length of contracts,all this and a helpfull expert at theend of a telephone.
3921|The service that Red Berry Recruitment Ltd received from utilitywise Plc has been outstanding, we received the information comparison from you and the information we received was full comprehensive. I would have no hesitation in contacting them with any questions , as they were so approachable Regards 
3922|The Utilitywise process was undertaken with minimal input from us. The options and pricing were clear from the outset and it took just one letter of authority from me to make the change.The new supplier didn't take over the supply of one of the contracts on exactly the right date but that was my only complaint.
3923|"Our contact at Utilitywise was helpful and offered several options which he explained clearly. He was able to secure a 5 year fixed price deal which will enable the business to better predict its costs over this period.I was however surprised to receive a phone call several minutes after ""locking in"" the prices to advise me that within the hour or two we had been reviewing the options and completing the paperwork the prices had increased. I was re-assured that this was normal under the circumstances and representative of the energy market as a whole.Overall I am pleased with the service we have received to this point. "
3924|I have just completed the renegotiation of my company's Gas & Electricity contracts, using Utilitywise for the first time. The staff took my existing contract details and carried out a prompt and comprehensive search of the market.They answered a myriad of questions from me in a patient and friendly way, and produced excellent proposals for both the Gas & Electricity, which I was pleased to accept.   I cannot find fault with their  business conduct.  Even having completed the initial negotiations, they have continued to follow up additional questions in a prompt and friendly manner. I would recommend them to anyone faced with the daunting prospect of carrying out a tariff survey of this type. Well done!.   
3925|Utilitywise have been fantastically supportive in sorting out a very complex situation with energy supplies to our various locations throughout the UK. They have organised some very good deals, fixed our rates going forward and made the whole exercise far less painful than it may otherwise have been without them. Would definitely recommend their services! 
3926|We gave Utilitywise a try with some scepticism but they did what they said they'd  do and took the stress out of having to do all the leg work when it comes to dealing with energy providers. They have given us a great service to date, staff are friendly and helpful and we are confident that they are really dedicated to finding us the best deal! We'd recommend with out hesitation.
3927|"I received a great service from Utilitywise and they have managed to save me 25% off my current bill.I receive calls daily from companies similar to Utilitywise, wanting to save me money on my utility bills, but have never bothered taking them up on their offers.Having taken a call from Utilitywise and realising they are based close to our office I thought I would give them a chance and they came up ""trumps"".I would certainly recommend them to anyone I know.Well Done!!!!!!!! "
3928|I would highly Utilitywise. The gentleman I dealt with is an excellent Energy Consultant and always provides a top level service. Excellent. 
3929|Utilitywise are very enthusiastic to get the best deal for you.  My contact came back to me several times with updated prices and helped to get us a good deal
3930|I have just had a super service provided by Utilitywise plc.The person I spoke to was professional at all times and extremely helpfulHe fully understood the needs of my company and I would strongly recommend that he contacts several other business friends of mine to help lower their fuel bills.Thank you very much for saving me a lot of money!
3931|I am impressed by all aspects of the service Utility Wise provides. The customer service is excellent as the staff are patient and perservering at all times and what's more the service delivers good results.
3932|The consultant that we dealt with was professional and very helpful.  No question was too silly, no problem to difficult.  He listened to who we are, what we do,and then after looking at our current contracts he found us a great gas contract and two electricity suppliers for us to choose from.  I did double check via a switch website and the same two came in the top 5 but the rates Utilitywise secured for us were lower.  Couldn't be more pleased! will definitely continue with them.
3933|We were highly delighted with the service provided by Utilitywise.  Throughout the course of our business, we only ever dealt with one member of staff, we were NEVER bounced from pillar to post!  Out contact was highly efficient, never pushy or overbearing, always helpful and eager to assist.Our dealings with Utiltywise are not yet complete as we have further ground to cover, but we are more than happy we are in capable hands.
3934|As a charity it is important that we are able to make savings whereever possible as we want to use our funds to support the services we offer the community. Utilitywise makes this possible by watching the market for us, advising us at contract renewal times and finding us the best deals for new contracts. It saves me time as I am not having to research the best deal, I can rely on Utilitywise to do this for us.
3935|We always go to Utility Wise when our utility renewals are due. They are always quick to give us very competitive quotes and they make the renewal or switch process very quick and simple which makes our working life a lot easier ! 
3936|With energy prices on the increase it was imperative we found a cheaper source Utilitywise did everything for me, saving me time and money on phone call,letters etc.The People at Utilitywise we helpful and friendly and as i was new to the running off a business, they put everything in laymans terms so i could understand about usage charges and different matters. i would recommend you give them a try! Helpful, Friendly, Reliable.
3937|Following the initial contact with Utilitywise I was confident that they would be able to search for the best offer for the supply of electricity that would meet our requirements as a Church. There was sufficient dialogue when reaching the decision on the best contract, in our case this was a five year contract. Although there was a slight increase over having a years contract, the five years has given us certainty of price without worrying about probable yearly increases and allows for better budget planning.   
3938|As a phone based CSR Lawrence is immense. Always striving to help us at PFG a glow illuminating our bleak future. When the phone rings and I hear his voice I am instantly uplifted. His guise and ultimate tact, in my opinion, set him apart from all others. If I didn't have a fiancee I would begin to question my sexuality. If I could somehow put his passion and flare into three words it would have to be, impossible to do! On the level though if he ever leaves your company, we'll take him. Much love to all at Utilitywise, crack on fellas!
3939|All the worry and stress of get the best deal,was taken away and handled in an efficient and professional manner. No more cold calling or nuisance phone calls,we are all signed/sealed and ready to go. Thanks for all there support. We only agreed a one year deal,but that suits our type of funding.
3940|i found utiltywise very helpfull and imformative and easy to talk to also all information relayed so easily understood very good customer skills would reccomend to others 
3941|In July 2012, a member of staff of Utility wise contacted me regarding power supplies to the Methodist Church in my village of which I am a member.  Community organisations and churches are finding it increasingly difficult to find the funds to pay the bills so I was obviously very interested to hear what was on offer.  The object of the telephone call, was to explain how we could possibly lower our bills and change suppliers.  The process was explained extremely well.  I was given all the details and my part in the process was very easy.  All the hard work was done by Utility Wise - I did not have to contact the company we were leaving at any time as this was all done for me.  We did encounter one or two problems with our previous supplier, but again Utility Wise dealt with this problem too.I was extremely please with the result and recommended this to some of our other organisations also.  The gentleman who dealt with our case was most helpful and patient.Quite recently, I had another conversation with a member of Utility Wise regarding our supplies - again explained very well and also to our advantage.  I am extremely grateful for their time and patience and thoughtfulness and would recommend them to anyone.Many thanks
3942|Positive work from consultant to ensure that we did deal with the issue rather than ignoring it.  Understanding that the first attempt to get agreeement had to be pulled through no one's fault but just conflicting diaries etc.Second attempt was successful and we were better prpared to react and deal with the issues mor quickly
3943|I was surprised to get a call from someone actually enthusiastic about my business and saving me money.  No long sales talk just straight talking and to the point.  They even got me a rebate!  All the hastle was taken out of the whole thing by keeping in contact, providing guidance and taking the strain out of the paperwork.I train staff in customer service and these guys obviously have been trained well.  I cant fault them!
3944|A quick conversation and an electricity bill scanned over to Utilitywise and within minutes we were on a much reduced tariff. There was little administration from my side and am now looking forward to reduced costs in the future.

3951|We have been using Utilitywise for several years now to obtain prices for our group and have always been extremely happy with them.  Staff are helpful and courteous and nothing is too much trouble.I would not hesitate to recommend them to any other company trying to obtain best prices in a very competitive market.
3952|Seamless in sorting out a very good deal. Only gripe is that they contacted us to become a new client when we were already one - right and left hand!
3953|Found them very easy to deal with.  The guy that I dealt with was professional, friendly and knew what he was talking about.  At this moment they could not find us a better deal but I would not hesitate to contact them again.  Did not feel under any pressure to commit to anything.
3954|I have dealt with an advisor at Utilitywise for many years. Utilitywise are possibly the only consistently efficient energy operator out there. They find great prices while providing unparalleled service. Utilitywise know when my renewals are due and contact me in good time to make sure we serve termination and line up the best prices in the market while also providing good insight into the energy market and as a result the term to go for. Highly recommend.
3955|A very efficient and helpful company always call you back or email you if they say they will.Always found us the best deals for our energy requirements. Friendly and courteous staff I particularly like that you have a designated point of contact.
3956|Utlitywise take all the hassle of remembering when your companies gas and electricity contracts are up for renewal well before the rollover period kicks in.  Always had an excellent service and will be continuing to use Utilitywise.
3957|The member of staff I dealt with was Linzi and she was absolutely great. Very patient with me as i kept postponing the decision. She was very knowledgeable, she explained everything clearly. The savings we'll make are to be seen and depend on the market, but I'm confident that we made a good decision based on the complicated calculations Linzi did for us. I would definitely recommend Utility Wise to everyone. They simplify the daunting process of choosing and switching to a new supplier and all free of charge!
3958|We were contacted by this company asking to review our energy contracts, they were swift and professional and managed to get us a good deal, overall we are very happy with the service provided. Best of all it was free to us.
3959|Excellent service, no hesitation in recommending Utility Wise, very professional and thorough from taking details to finding a suitable firm with a competitive price; to putting everything in place so you can sit back knowing that every aspect has been covered.

3963|Have shopped around & found this to be the best option
3964|This was a very easy process, which he explained clearly and kept me regularly updated as to what stage the agreement was at. Would definitely use this service again.
3965|Decided to go with Utility wise after having numerous problems dealing direct with various different suppliers and I have to say they have taken a weight off my mind.  I deal with a few different utility companies and it was beginning to be a bit of a nightmare remembering which ones were in contract and how much we were paying.  I had researched them on the internet first as I don't always like to deal with new companies that we don't know but I needn't have worried.  All the reviews I read were very positive and I only have good things to say about them too.  The thing I like most is that you are not phoning a call centre where you just speak to whoever is available and they dont know who you are.  You are dealing with the same person (Energy Consultant) and they get to know who you are.  You also have a direct line and e-mail to deal with them direct. Its a bit of a win win situation - you get a better deal and you have a name at the end of the phone.
3966|We have used Utility Wise as our energy broker for a number of years and have always found that they provide an efficient service is sourcing new prices for us. He has been our main contact and has always been helpful and professional. 
3967|HAVING DEALT WITH UTILITY WISE, THE OVERALL SERVICE THEY PROVIDED WAS VERY EFFICIENT, STRAIGHT FORWARD, NO HASTLE, FRIENDLY AND I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEM TO OTHER COMPANIES/ASSOCIATIONS.

3969|Been dealing with utilitywise for a while now all I can say is that they have been absolutely fantastic and have saved me so much money in my business I would definitely recommend them to anyone. They have been absolutely fantastic wih contacting me back and dealing with my requests so efficiently and quickly. They have been able to secure me the best deals available.
3970|I have received very good service from utility wise and would definately use them again in the future. My contact there is really proffessional. Thanks for your hard work in getting me a good deal.
3971|5 star very happy would recommend to others.hassle free
3972|I spoke to a chap who advised my business centre was paying way more than we should have been for Gas and Electricity. Like hoseholds gas and electricty pricing is crucial for a bsuiness and it is important we try to keep overheads down. The chap I spoke to looked into all of our pricing and did so fast and efficiently. He explained the background to the pricing as he went along and broke any pricing I didnt understand down so it was easy to get my head around. Utility wise would allow my company to make a massive saving  - around 60% which is phenomenal. I thank the chap for his time and effort in showing me this as we were paying costs unecessarily. I would recomend this company to anyone wanting to look into their pricing with no pressure to move accross. 
3973|I was contacted by the company, it was explained to me how the company works. The person I delt with friendly and very helpful. I feel confident that we will be able to work well together.
3974|Everything was very good and it all happened very smoothly with no hitches whatsoever.
3975|A big thank you to the consultant  at Utlilitywise for all the help and assistance he gaves to find a new supplier for our electricity. James worked long and hard to find us the best deal and helped tremendously even when we were unsure. It was a very difficult decision for us as we had previously been tied in to a very good long term deal with our current supply. We knew we were going to be faced with a big jump in pricing but James helped us to minimize that pain! Thanks James

3980|I was asked all the relevant questions and my details were taken efficiently and correctly, no second requests.The change over from my original supplier has been carried out smoothly and I did not have to chase anyone to do anything, which has made a very pleasant change.
3981|The member of staff we dealt with was first class. If he said he would call us back at a certain time, we would receive the call. We were kept informed every step of the process and each detail explained to us when required. A very professional company.
3982|The advisor was very helpful, even beyond the transfer of our account. I hadn't realised I could still use Utility Warehouse to help resolve queries with the supplier. Would use again.
3983|As most people are very aware the power, light ,heat markets are a mine field unless you take considerable time and effort to understand these yourself . To find a company that will research and attain the best deal for you that you can accept with confidence is difficult .

3988|Dealt with utilitywise during September - October to review utility contracts across a number of sites (care settings). Excellent advice from very helpful staff member who helped check all current rates, contract dates and research better value contracts. How timely was this given the hike in prices announced recently.
3989|We were approached by Ultility Wise. Initially we were slightly apprehensive to put our account into their hands.  We did not need to worry! The company and member of staff we dealt with was first class!  If they said they would call you back at a certain time, you would receive the call with never a chase up needed!

3996|We are happy with the service provided by this company.  They have worked efficently to combine our electricity accounts and search for the best long term deals on the market, and have kept us informed at every step.
3997|sales staff were very good responding to questions regarding switching suppliers

4010|I received a Telephone call from Utilitywise to see whether they could get me a better deal on my Gas and Electric, At first I was un-sure as I already got a good deal from my previous Suppliers, They said there was no commitment until I was Happy with the results, They got back to me with the figures which was Cheaper again to what I am paying so I agreed. With the Energy Prices just going up and up, I am Well Pleased mine has came down.      I would definitely recommend a friend if they can keep up with the Best offers. I asked a few questions before I did agree about the length of contract being 5 years as I like to keep them short just incase a better deal comes through but it seems a price not to miss out on.
4011|Utilitywise have organised the renewal or change of provider for both Gas and Electric over the past couple of years. Their service has been efficient and I have always been kept well informed of all details relating to any changes. Recently, Utilitywise has arranged new long fixed term contracts which I am confident will keep costs down in light of the recent energy price increases announced.Very happy with the service provided and will continue to use Utilitywise for the forseeable future.
4012|A slick easy to use service, the service is very helpful and friendly.A pleasure to work with and would recommend. 
4013|Staff at Utilitywise are helpful and knowledgeable. Communications have been excellent and overall dealings have been a pleasure.

4016|Pleasing staff, and good service.  Quick and efficient. They are much help to my business. 
4017|So much easier to have Utilitywise do all the searching for you.
4018|I would recommend Utilitywise to anyone, they do the work shopping around so you don't have to! They were quick, polite and efficient and above all were honest! 5 stars!
4019|Utility Wise has made the minefield of electricity suppliers much easier to understand!!They have always been very friendly and easy to communicate with and I would recommend them without hesitation. 
4020|It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to utility sales, but my Account Manager at Utiltywise certainly does impress me. The service and knowledge of the industry that I receive is second to none, and I have personally worked in the 'people' business for many years. Even when I am slow in responding to messages - the chaser calls I get are not heavy. If all the staff at Utilitywise are as good as my Account Manager, then I cannot recommend them more highly.   
4021|I would recommend Utility Wise as their staff are extremely helpful, courteous and efficient in everything they do. They have saved us money in an efforltless change over.

You don't have to wait in a Que to speak to people on the phone line and its great to feel supported in the gas and electric area which can seem like a minefield to some (like me). Thank you for your ongoing help.
4024|"utilitywise""s efficientsy in finding my company a better deal for our electricity supply ,and doing all the spade work in the change over to a new contract ,great service ."
4025|With funding cuts received within our organisation and more cuts for 2014-15 it became a priority to cut our costs wherever possible.Utilitywise have provided an excellent service where we have not only reduced our energy costs for both of our buildings but have also received a substantial discout due to VAT percentages overcharged.
4026|I have been really very pleased with the help & on going support the I have received from Utility Wise. They have provided a great service and  competitive pricing for both our Gas & Electricity contracts. Transferring suppliers has been managed by Utility wise without any hassle or problems. I would have no hesitation in recommending Utility -wise. There has been no hard sell, they have explained the different options available to me without pushing me to make a quick decision, and have always given me time to go away & compare prices elsewhere.  
4027|After moving premises and all the hassle that brings with it utilitywise provided an excellent service that took away all the hassle of searching for utility prices.  Will definitely recommend to others and will use again when current contracts expire.  They provided all requested information in an easy to read format and made the whole process quick and hassle free.My contact was great and easy to talk too, she provided me with the necessary information so I could make an informed choice rather than just pick the cheapest or best known, they definitely know what they are talking about.
4028|Utility wise have been great.  They have taken the stress out finding the best utility deals for us as a charity.   I know I will be reminded when contracts are due for renewal and that they will find me the best deal - that would have taken me ages to find if I could have found them at all.  I know that I have a helpful voice at the end of the phone if I don't understand something about a contract or the start of a contract. They also realized we were paying too higher rate of VAT on our energy as a charity, so we had a significant repayment thanks to the observant eye of your employee. All in all I have found the experience of using Utilitywise very supportive and worthwhile financially.
4029|"We were approached by Utilitywise and at first I was sceptical as we receive so many calls from companies offering to help find the ""best prices"".  The man who called us was, in fact, the only person who did what he said he would do.  He worked so hard to find us the best prices for both gas and electricity and explained everything in laymen's terms.  He kept us informed of everything the whole way through and offered professional and expert advice.  Well done and thank you."
4030|I received a very proactive service from Utilityiwise and the recommendations received demonstrated a real concern for our business costs.
4031|We have had a lot of dealings with energy suppliers over the last 30 years and Utility Wise has been by far the most friendly, helpful and accomodating. The advisor has always been very helpful and willing to 'cut out the middle man' so to speak, in order to save us time and give us the best possible service available. Whether this has been contacting us to assure us that everything is going to plan, or to ring us to inform us of any developments with previous energy suppliers! We would recommend to anyone!!!
4032|Extremely helpful with advice, listened to my comments and continued to find an alternative supplier.Consultant was very efficient with information and how the process worked, I felt completely confident with his service and was pleased with the short time taken to achieve the goals.This company offer an excellent service of being a service provider and finding the best deals in Gas and Electricity supplies.
4033|as above title, the service and saving was just brilliant easy passage to get my bills down and most helpful young man ,with great knowledgethank you Utility Wise  
4034|Good service especially at the start when we were setting up our many accounts, if there was any problems they were sorted very quickly and we were kept in the loop.
4035|Utilitywise helped us fix electricity contract for four years and would recommend them.  All done quickly and smoothly in a very friendly manner.They will be sorting out our gas shortly and we anticipate a repeat performance. 
4036|I have used utility wise for 3 years now and they have always exceeded my expectations and got me great deals on our electricity. They have a fantastic customer service team who provide the correct amount of contact so you don't feel hassled unlike some other providers.  
4037|I WAS APPROACHED INTIALLY AND AGREED TO SPEAK TO A CONSULTANT FOR UTILITY WISE I NORMALLY REFUSE THESE TYPE OF CALLS AS SO MANY ARE JUST WASTEFULL TO MY TIME AND LEAD NOW WHERE. HOWEVER ON THIS OCCASION I WAS LEFT IN PEACE BY HIM WHO SAID LEAVE IT WITH ME AND IF I CAN ARRANGE A NEW VIABLE CONTRACT I WILL DROP YOU A MAIL INCLUDING YOUR OPTIONS AND FOLLOW IT UP IN A WEEK OR SO. TO BE FAIR I THOUGHT LITTLE MORE OF IT UNTILL I WAS PESTERED SO MUCH BY OTHER REALLY PUSHY COMPANIES TO MOVE OUR CONTRACT INSTANTLY WHILST ON THE TELEPHONE WHICH I FELT REALLY UNCOMFOTABLE WITH. TRUE TO HIS WORD DID COME BACK TO ME IN THE SEVEN OR DAYS HE HAD MENTIONED AND WE AGREED FOR HIM TO MOVE OUR CONTRACT ON THAT DAY. WE ARE NOW MOVED AND HAD HASSLE FREE MOVEMENT TO ANOTHER PROVIDER. SO AS FAR AS WE CONCERNED WE HAD A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE AND WOULD PUT UTILITY WISE FORWARD AS A RECOMENDATION AND ALSO MR THE CONSULTANT FOR HIS CURTISY AND PROFFESIONLISM. AIR BRAKE CONNECTIONS LIMITED DA11 8RU
4038|Utilitywise helped me reduce my electricity costs and I would recommend them to anyone, they made it quick and easy in a very friendly no nonsense manner
4039|I was phoned up by these guys at random and taking my usually protective stance of tele sales i was very impressed to find the guy very friendly,  not pushy and knowledgeable. In truth i was very impressed by the savings i could make(saved quite a bit of money and fixed my contract for 2 years) and after checking out a few other deals i actually found cheaper. I got back in touch and my adviser Mark, was not annoyed at all about me getting a better price but went back again and got me the best possible price!(I did check again). So i can safely say it's well worth giving these guys a go. Thanks a lot Utility Wise and Mark in particular.
4040|Very efficient service from Utilitywise always providing the cheapest prices available in the marketplace.
4041|Everyone needs help understanding their utility bill and everybody deserves to now about how to save money from the money grabbing utility companies. Utility wise are here to help with straightforward friendly advice. They can handle most of the legwork for you and explain what they will do and when. Plus it is free - always a bonus, hopefully a win win situation. 
4042|this is the first time I have let someone do this for me as I have been caught out a couple of time by some smooth talking people (to keep it polite)in the past. With utility wise it could not have been easier and straight forward. A credit to all the staff who work for utility wise. All it took was a couple of phone calls and it was all done when they said it would be.
4043|Thanks to the team at Utilitywise, the process of renewing our electricity contract was smooth and painfree. I was presented with a number of options based on our requirements which were not all cost driven and we had a smooth transfer, which was essential to avoid any disruption to the business. Thanks again !!!
4044|This is the second time I have used Utilitywise, which speaks volumes.Very helpful, informed and patient advisers.  Gave great advice about resolving problems with current supplier.  No pressure sales pitch just facts and figures.Would definitely recommend.
4045|The service was fantastic from start to finish,a big thanks to all concerned  I would definitely recommend to friend's 
4046|Utilitywise sourced the cheapest electricity and gas contracts for our business, securing our energy prices for five years. This was a swift and simple process as they carried out the work on our behalf at no cost to ourselves.This saved the time it would have taken to contact all the energy providers ourselves to try and obtain a better quote.
4047|Having dealt with other companies and ending up doing it myself, I was reluctant at first, but the straightforward and efficient service I received from Utilitywise to secure a good rate for our gas and electricity was great. Being kept informed of the process was reassuring and they always contacted me when they promised to.
4048|We had great relationship with this company, they were very professional, extremely helpful and would definately would recommend to others, first class service. 
4049|... And for us they did it very well.The day our contact first spoke to me to take some details they came back with prices for a number of suppliers. Our existing one was the dearest. Having decided to swithc suppliers (both electricity and gas) Utility Wise did all the paperwork, we only had to sign it and fax it back. Simple, no fuss, fast and efficient. New contracts sorted and left us too get on with our business.
4050|Utility wise takes all the hard work out of reviewing electricity contracts, we have 3 separate meters at our business premises and ensuring that we didn't roll into automatic roll over contracts at extortionate rates was becoming a headache. Now we don't have to worry, all the reviews are completed in a timely and professional manner saving me the time and effort of looking for best rates which as an individual I did not have access to the preferential rates that Energy wise can secure on our behalf. Any oh so easy way to save money - would highly recommend for commercial users! 
4051|Proactive service, timely advice, comprehensive price comparisons
4052|Utility wise were very helpful and sorted all the contracts with the utility companies now I don't have to deal with them any more. 
4053|I have found all the staff at utilitywise are more than helpfull,and with this in mind made me fill that leaving our gas and electric costing in thier hands was the best thing we have done.
4054|Yet again the service, professionalism and attention to detail mark Utilitywise a cut above the rest. Having been advised by this company for many years they still provide the input that we need to help us run our business. Keep up the good work!
4055|I am really happy with the service I received. I couldn't fault any thing
4056|Having worked with Utility Wise for over 18 months now, I have been delighted with the service they are providing. The payments are always clear and punctual, the service from my Co-ordinator in Partner Channel is very good.Happy to recommend them to any other.
4057|Our consultant provided an friendly and helpful service and found a supplier who will provide our church a a more competitive rate for our gas supply. The service from utility wise was efficient and informative and saved me the problem of serching for the best deals. 
4058|Excellent service from an industry leader. Every customer presented is given the same attention not dependant on size of contract. We have a great relationship with this company and look to extend our business in the future.
4059|I had not used Utilitywise before, having previously negotiated contracts directly with utility suppliers myself, but decided to give them a try. There was no pressure selling and everything was explained clearly by the Consultant. After discussing the options, I had confidence that the rates she came up with were good deals and it saved me a lot of time and effort. I have no hesitation in recommending them. 
4060|Extremely helpful and informative.  They found the best price for our needs and kept me informed of each stage of the process. This made the process stress free which is very important when you are trying to manage a very busy business.  I would certainly recommend them to other people.
4061|Good service, quick and easy to deal with, just what we wanted to review our energy bills. Contracts setup without any hassle. 
4062|I found utility wise to be of an exceptional service and saved me an awful lot of time and effort finding the best deal for both gas and electric for my church and hall here at St Herbert's church in Carlisle.The Utilitywise consultant was patient, and very professional in her manor and expertise and I would fully recommend her and Utilitywise to everyone.Rev Alun JonesCarlisleCumbria
4063|He got in touch with us with a better proposal for our electricity and managed to negotiate with EON on our behalf to reduce our electricity rates. For that reason we recommended him to another business to improve their electricity rates and he was able to help them also. So we can confidently recommend him to anyone in need of these services and we will be using him in the future.
4064|likes - quick and efficient transition from previous suppliersdefinitely cheaperdislikes - it would be cheaper as we are expected to read our own meters and supply readings by emailDirect debit confusion with gas and elec accounts caused confusion initially
4065|The process of finding a utility company with the most competitive prices was easy with the fantastic assistance of Ian Blackburn of Utilitywise. He kept me updated throughout the whole process. This is the company to use when it's time to change. Thank you.
4066|This is the second year running I have used utility wise. They offer a great service and their staff are really helpful and friendly. They got us a great deal on our new energy contract which saved me a lot of time and effort. I would highly recommend this company.
4067|Anaysing energy suppliers is a complex business but the adviser from Utility Wise was patient, thorough in the explanations, and gained my trust that the supplier suggested was the best one for my company.I did not feel pressurised and, on my request, was given time to consider my decision.  Follow up conversations and emails were made as promised, which in this day and age is not always the case.
4068| Utilitywise looked at my business's energy usage and expenditure and produced proposals for reduced spend, frozen for five years - it's saved us money straight away and removed the risk of price increases.
4069|The thought of having to negotiate new contracts with all my energy suppliers at different end dates was mind boggling. When Utilitywise got in tough, it was a no brainer!At this crucial time with energy bills on the up, I have still been able to save over GBP500.00 per year for my premises. All the hard work is taken care of, and at the end of the experience I have saved money. I liked the professional approach and helpfulness from the staff which set them aside from any other supplier. I would highly recommend Utilitywise
4070|Never having used this type of company before,we were initially wary of using them. However the excellent service,full explanations with follow up's (at the times promised)allayed our fears. We then fixed our energy rates at the time of a volatile market.
4071|I was very happy with the service provided by Utility Wise, they were of great assistance and not at all pushy. I would recommend this company to people to trawl the market for the best upcoming deals and to get something locked in to protect yourself from price rises.
4072|Utilitywise offer a brilliant service, which has simplified our energy contract process, simply because they complete most of the legwork for you.Their sales representative was very helpful in providing our company with the relevant information required to make our decisions, as well as providing excellent customer service. Our contracts are now in place well in advance, allowing us to avoid the usual last minute dealings with various energy companies.Highly recommended. 
4073|Very straight forward. Provided all the details on  pricing against our usage so that it was an easy decision on who to sign up with for energy supply. Very helpful in all aspects
4074|Our co-ordinator in the Partner Channel is extremely professional and efficient. I have found her to be excellent in keeping us updated and has a great knowledge of all the systems especially were payments are involved. We rarely have to contact her as she gives us regular updates and on the occasions when we have had queries they have been dealt with very quickly and to our complete satisfaction.  
4075|Helpful and efficient without being pushy.We have already switched our Gas supply through Utilitywise, and will be talking to them next year when our Electricity contract is due for renewal.
4076|A really helpful, personal service. We have consistently dealt with one person who is helpful, friendly and efficient. The service they provide has been exceptional and has consistently saved us money.
4077|Our companies experience using Utilitywise was a positive one; their sales representative were friendly and very helpful.They helped us to consolidate our meter contract dates, previously scattered throughout the year, to one single end date, which is fantastic; We hadn't been able to do this with our previous broker.
4078|Aquarius is a charity and having him as our consultant has been fantastic, very helpful and always friendly. When we start up new services or in new premises, he is the first person I will contact to sort out the problem for me. He looks at all the providers and find the best value for us. I would recommend them to anyone whos looking to change to help them find the best value provide. My previous experience with some companies have been very pushy as they want your business.
4079|FAST AND EFFICIENT SERVICE AND COMMUNICATION WITH OUT FEELING IT WAS PRESSURE SALES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY  SAVED US MONEY ON OUR UTILITY COSTS. OUR CONTACT CRAIG PORTSMOUTH KEPT US POLITELY FULLY INFORMED THROUGH OUT THE PROCESS 
4080|I feel that I received excellent advice when we reviewed our electricity contract - and that support did not once Utlilitywise had again been selected as our preferred electricity supplier. They have been proactive in coming forward to see if they can help us in any way.
4081|Utility wise sort out our gas and electric for four sites.  They find us the best deals and keep on top of all the contracts etc.  I dont even have to think about it. No fear of over-running a contract and moving to the dreaded out of contract price. I just get a call every so often from Lewis telling me that my X site is due for renewal and he has got us Xp which is the best deal at the moment.  He reads me a script, I say yes a few times and that is it.  Easy peasy. 
4082|We had a huge problem at buyrite tyres na devon. Our bills were getting larger and when talking to our suppliers we were left confused. Brian Lamport was like a angel sent from utility above.  Brian Lamport took control and we were left with a credit for more than 9000.00 pounds.
4083|We are very pleased with the service we received, resulting in a reduced electricity bill. No problems encountered at all!  We recommend Utilitywise without reservation.
4084|There was a difficult start to the business relationship due to British Gas and our previous electricity supplier, however, the efforts  to resolve this issue were second to none. The issue took a year to resolve but at no time did I feel that our problem was not being investigated as it should. I will continue to use Utilitywise in future.
4085|The only cold caller to ever grab my interest and he got me a great deal. I can email any time and he will get back to me the same day if I have any questions or concerns. All transitions were easy, which is good for me as I am constantly busy in my business. 
4086|Like all cold call salesmen, one tends to get a bit cynical but this company has come up trumps.First they have found a surperb deal for our electricity supply, locked in for three years.It doesn't just end there.You get own personal contact, who is availble at all times, in my case a Mark Wilson,if there is any quries with the contract and change over.Even when the deal is done, Mark has phoned to explain the step by step procedures as they happen.Down side? Not found any yet.
4087|I have been dealing with Utilitywise now for around 4 years. I run 4 warehouses across the country and at each site Utilitywise have arranged both my gas and electricity. They have provided great deals at all these sites - I have even price benchmarked them during my last renewal and couldn't match the prices they were quoting! I know I shouldn't mention names, but I have always dealt with Kirk in their office - he goes the extra mile, always keeps me informed and it has been a pleasure doing business with him over the last 4 years!
4088|I am very happy with the service received.
4089|All the staff we dealt with were extremely professional and unusually helpful! Nothing was a problem and they made everything really clear and easy to understand.  They took all the hassle out of researching the market and potentially choosing a new supplier. Never had any problems getting in touch with someone by telephone, if they were busy we would always get a call back.  Great work, nice to have someone on our side for a change!  Would recommend anyone using Utility Wise in the future.  We certainly will be using them for all our contracts. Well done Utility Wise.
4090|The advisor was most helpful and dealt with the whole process for me.
4091|The Company operates from several depots. Formerly each had a separate electricity supply contract and a separate gas supply contract. All had different suppliers, rate structures, renewal dates etc.Utilitywise brought all the electricity contracts together and all the gas contracts together with one supplier and rationalised the renewal dates. Had we made our own arrangements with the several suppliers involved, this would have been a lengthy complicated process. Such problems as have arisen have been due to the supplier processes and have been dealt with promptly by Utilitywise on our behalf.We expect this will result in useful administration and energy cost savings over the period of the contract.
4092|Having had plenty of esperience with energy consultant services in the past I found Utilitywise to be very responsive company who were willing to be patient & also provide all the information required as requested. The layout of the information provided could be improved in terms of what is included / not included in quotations that are sent to customers but apart from that the information provided was very accurate. All questions were answered promptly and in full so a smooth transition from our previous supplier was never in doubt. Well organised individual staff who know the industry / products and the requirements needed to put together complete quotes. All in all a sound choice for our company and hopefully a long relationship will develop.
4093|The agent very helpful on the phone - know's the industry - will keep a close eye on our savings and customer service of his recommended supplier. 
4094|Had many dealings with the agent and have found him extremely thorough and customer service orientated. Whatever I have thrown at him he has tried to resolve for the better.
4095|I found the agent very helpful and friendly, good advice and she seemed more like a friend as well as saving the company money.
4096|We were contacted via a cold call, which can be unwelcome, but your employee presented your service as so useful and with such an easy, friendly manner, that we passed the task of ensuring we had the best energy rates available over to Utilitywise, feeling as if they were doing us a favour.  Since then, we have had the same contact, who now feels a familiar person to me, and to any of my colleagues who pick up the phone and I feel we are in good hands.
4097|I was approached by Utilitywise whilst using the services of another broker. Due to time pressure I was unable to switch to Utilitywise, but the friendly and helpful attitude of Energy Consultant was very impressive and I would certainly be very happy to work with Utilitywise in the future.
4098|Utility wise approached me to assist with arranging Gas and electricity supplies at three different sites for our small charity. We got fantastic fixed price deals for 2and3 years. Our agent was so friendly and she inspired confidence in my dealings with Utility wise, she chatted like we were old friends and we also talked about the fuels, explaining why each deal was so good at that time, and for the future. I'm so glad we fixed the price as the latest price hike news is alarming, it's like future proofing our charity's budget. Any problems with meters and direct debits were soon sorted by her and we have received an excellent service from them. I can call them or email at any time for help and advice.
4099|"We have used Utility Wise for the last two years and would highly recommend them to anyone wishing to change supplier. Our consultant Brian Lamport has at all times been very polite and courteous. Brian is extremely knowledgeable on the various utility companies. The transfers were arranged with the minimal paper work on our side which is an added bonus when running a busy office. When we had a query on an invoice this was solved promptly by Brian.Brian even went the extra mile by calling into the office to collect some paperwork ""what a star"""
4100|Often with cold calls about energy prices, there is a degree of push and pressure to get a deal done.  Not so here.  We have been in your system for many months-since March, and the delay has been on my part because of family and church commitments. Yet Gareth has been persistent without being pushy, no irritation over delays and patient in seeking out new prices when contact has been renewed. Even as we were coming closer to a deal, he still pressed for more and more savings. Obvious past experience and local knowledge counted in the process, I would not have closed in with any offers made if the call centre was outside the UK:  you use a telephone number which is identifiable and can be traced and used, which I have done several times. As with most things in life, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we will wait until this time next year to see the scale of saving we have achieved.
4101|With price rises happening all the time in all sectors it is a real help for someone else to take over the sourcing and re-organisation of our supplies.
4102|I can only praise KS at Utility Wise for his quick efficient, friendly service.  Everything was explained in a clear detailed manner and I found the whole process of changing supplier very straightforward. He made everyting hassle free and has hopefully secured us a good deal - time will tell as we move to new provider at end of January 2014. I would recommend this company to others.  
4103|Since we have been connected to Utility Wise we have them to be helpfull and our contact to be highly efficiant with any problems we have had. And we would have no hesitation in recommending their services to other Companies and collogues
4104|The change over to a new supplier was quick and effiecientand I had very little imput,whitch was great I would recommend this service to anyone switching suppliers.
4105|I have used Utilitywise for two years now and have always found their service to be spot on. Very prompt and thorough and most importantly they have helped me keep my utility costs as low as possible.
4106|We have received excellent service from Utilitywise. Our account manager kept us informed with the progress of switching our four premises to the new supplier and arranged the length of the contracts so that they would all come up for renewal on the same date. Excellent service and highly recommended.
4107|Very friendly staff and the whole process was made very easy and more importantly saved us money thank you
4108|Utilitywise have been very quick at finding us good prices on a number different buildings for both gas and electricity, the advisor is always quick to come back to us with price details and clear information. She is also very good and reminding us well in advance of our contract end dates. It takes away all the hassle!
4109|helps to have someone else to take the pain out of comparing costs with a non level playing field not to mention saving business time
4110|The advisor we had is part of an excellent and caring team of professionals who have been partners of Powerful Allies for several years. As a key adminstrator, she has always been attentive and very thorough in providing crucial contract data for us. Together with her colleagues, we have no hesitation in recommending the Utilitywise Group.
4111|The advisor that helped me, had excellent communication skills and explained everything in simple lay man terms for me to be able to understand better, and sorted everything out with the change overs and hopefully found me the best deals. I definitely would recommend them to my family and friends. Just awaiting the change over to my new suppliers now to see the benefits.
4112|Gareth Olds was our customer relations manager and he made sure that he found  the right deal for us and tailored it to our requirements. The follow-up extension of the contract was also handled very well and we were advised at every stage. Well done keep up the good work.
4113|Excellent customer service from  utilitywise who give me the information I was looking for, and answered any questions I had regarding their products.
4114|Utilitywise have been wonderful. Always very polite and happy to help. The Customer service is excellent. Would definitely recommend to any other business looking to use the service Utilitywise provides. 
4115|I can say that in my experience that Lewis was informative and helpful with my need to secure the lowest price for Gas and Electricity. The prices agreed were very satisfactory.
4116|Helpfull and trouble free  the transition was quite painles
4117|Efficient service and very competitive supply charges.
4118|I have been corresponding with Craig Portsmouth.   I have found him to be very helpful and polite.      
4119|Great service really helped with finding the best rate  thank you 
4120|not much to say about it indeed good value for money and great service. only annoying things is about once when I am not agree for any offer you provide I got another call for another person and this is repeating. 
4121|Utilitywise contacted me to offer their services to my Council to help us find cheaper gas and electricity supply contracts. They did exactly that. We've achieved a modest saving and protection against price rises for a few years so I'm pretty happy.It did all involve rather more phone calls and paperwork than I expected but they did their part very efficiently throughout.
4122|Throughout any communication we have found Utilitywise to be very helpful, very courteous and very obliging, making what would have been a difficult exercise very smooth indeed.Many thanks for all of your hard work.
4123|We have placed multiple properties with utilitywise and their rate appear to be competitive email billing and website are easy to use watch out if you don't keep up your standing order payments but that's your own danger they do say they charge if you miss it also having to take your own reading every month is a bit of a pain but to be fair they are introducing smart meters .....overall good service tho Bryan Lamport is our point if contact he's very efficient.
4124|Recently changed energy supplier which was simple and painless.  The customer service team were helpful and informative.
4125|I was given good clear info in  with no big spiel. He was helpful and didn't mind explaining things. We'll happy with my new supplier from whom I wouldn't of found unless utility wise had phoned, nothing was to much trouble.I will only use this company now for my business as didn't feel as though I was being pressured as so many callers do
4126|Utilitywise have been very helpful and got us a very good deal on our electricity for our business. Service was polite and efficient.
4127|A very helpful South African young man explained the process very clearly.  After sending him some basic information about our move to new offices, he was able to come up with a range of options that will save us over 25% per on electricity alone, compared to the best price we were offered direct from the energy company.  Why wouldn't we change?  The company have demonstrated that they know the marketplace and can deliver excellent savings in an effective and efficient process that was easy and painless for us.We will certainly be investigating other area's of our business to see what else Utility Wise can do for us.It's a no-brainer!
4128|ast year we (St Andrews Church Sidcup) were contacted by Utility-wise, with a proposal to save on our energy costs through Total Gas and Power. This we took up and were satisfied. In August 2013 we were contacted again by Utility-wise to offer a) free smart meters, b) extension of current contract to May 2019 and c) a further modest reduction in costs.  This was agreed and confirmed by Jason Atkinson (Utility-wise).  We have had written confirmation of the change for our gas supply, but are still awaiting any confirmation of the change for electricity. I have spoken with TGP who seemed to acknowledge this other change of contract, but to date we still have not received the confirmation. We have also had a visit to install the  gas Smart meter but, so far, it hasn't been possible to have it installed!  
4129|I am treasurer at Newsome Working Mens club in huddersfield, i am responsible for finding the cheapest quotes for all out utilities. i was more than happy with the service i have had from the agent and continue to have. she was always polite and couldn't have been more helpful.I would highly recommend the service i received to any business looking for an efficient, freindly, helpful service. The rates we received were very competetive in todays complicated market. thank you. gail malone (treasurer)
4130|Excellent service, the agent got us the best deal possible, very quick to reply & explain with any concerns we may have. He was very patient & wasn't pushy & demanding as other consultants have been in the pass. We would recommend utility wise. 
4131|Gareth Charlton rang me when we were just about to renew our gas and electricity contracts and offered to do the leg work for us by finding other providers at better prices. As we run a bed and breakfast this has been a Godsend for us as time is limited. When I have had any queries I have been able to ring and get the answer straight away or very soon after. I am very happy with the service provided and have recommended Utilitywise to others.
4132|Can't really judge whether the transfer is effortless as we don't change supplier untill Jan 2014 but in dealing with Utilitywise thus far I can positively say that they have been extremely helpful and the process has been stress free , not something you get to say often about utility companies !We'll update in the New Year but if the current experience is anything to go by I don't forsee any hassle.
4133|Have to admit that the person dealing with my accounts (Scott Robson), was very patient and took on a lot dealing with our previous suppliers (OPUS). Had to authorise that he represent us in dealings with the previous company. As they acted as if the contracts had not been cancelled and continued to decline the cancelations of contracts. This went on for months.All I can say is thanks to Scott, and I admire your perseverance and patience. And am happy that every thing is sorted. You took on a lot in dealing with OPUS, and it is appreciated. Thus far am very happy with our new contracts and look forward to a good five years of hassle free supply.Well done Scott.
4134|Utilitywise, particularly Lewis Mckie, have been brilliant at offering us the laternatives we needed to move utility suppliers. All information has been presented in te concise manner and questions answered without delay.
4135|After months and months of trying to sort our business electricity supplier to no avail.I received a call from Utility Wise who very quickly managed to sort our problem out in no time and after myself having to make numerous lengthy calls to different call centres I was obviously very impressed by the service I was provided from utility wise.Fantastic customer service and I would recommend utility wise thank you. 
4136|My experience with utility wise has been great! Consultant has been very helpful and efficent getting together our energy contracts for us taking away the stress and worry off our backs. She has found has some very good deals over the years of dealing with her and has built up a good relationship with our company and we feel we can put all our trust into her. She is always really friendly and chatty when dealing with her and offers good advise! Kirsty Sutherland Planet BBK Ltd
4137|I am constantly pestered by these companies who purport to be offering deals on electricity prices. I have stopped using alternatives and use Emerson from Utility wise who gives the best deals and I don't bother with any one else. Try him. Peter
4138|I used Utility Wise for the first time this year, our contact was helpful and efficient and found us the best deals for our Gas and Electricity. I would highly recommend him and Utility Wise, they take the hassle of sourcing the best deals off your shoulders!! 
4139|"There is a key staff member at Utilitywise that I have built up a great relationship with and I am confident that he will contact me not only to remind/inform me that one of my utility contracts is due for renewal but to take away the stress of ""shopping around"" for the best deal.  There are usually a number of different options for me to consider and once I have selected a new contract, the paperwork is dealt with promptly and I have never had an issue with any part of the process.  The whole process saves me so much time as we have a number of properties with differing lengths of contracts and termination dates.  I am confident that Utilitywise will always find me a great deal too so I'm saving money in more ways than one!"
4140|Unitilitywise have been managing our utility suppliers for a number of years. They obtain quotes befroe contracts expire and make recommenrdations before actioning any change agreed by ourselves.We have found the service to be professional and useful. The service also saves us time and effort as we have a number of sites with both Gas and Electricity.More proacticve account management woudl be improve the service. It would also be helpful if annual meeting was arranged to review how the service has been provided and to inform us of any new services being provided.
4141|Our experience of using Utilitywise has been a very pleasant one which will hopefully save us money on our energy bills. Our transition between energy suppliers has so far gone very smoothly and has required very little effort on our part. Our consultant Bobby has been friendly, efficient and informative during the process and has contacted us throughout to make sure we are having no problems with our switchover. As we are still in the changeover period I can't comment on the complete process yet but we anticipate the remainder of the switch over will run smoothly. Thank you to Bobby for his help and advice throughout. 
4142|I would recommend Utility Wise to any body, we have excellent service from Utility Wise and they have taken all the stress of us.
4143|Having had numerous callers pretending to be from, or representing utility companies, it was refreshing to deal with a company that was open honest and delivered what they said they would : a better deal for my Business.Gareth Charlton was god send he guided me through the whole process, as it some times feels its like a never ending maze, with all the different tariffs  and rates, deals short term long term. I would confidently recommend this company.
4144|I deal with the agent through my position as a Finance Team Leader, we have accounts with British Gas and she has been very supportive to me with many difficulties. I can honestly say that without her assistance I would find dealing with British Gas almost immpossible. Thank you Utilitywise
4145|Provided our business with an excellent service which made the process of finding a supplier and switching, trouble free. Thank you.
4146|considering my situation, she helped me, to reduce my bill. due to her excellent work the energy company refunded me a substantial amount of money and negotiated a good energy tariff.I wish her future success in her carrier
4147|Since being contacted by an agent about being able to reduce my gas and electricity prices, I have been extremely pleased with the dramatic reduction in my bills. I have already told friends and family about this service and I think one or two have been in touch. I particularly like the idea of being able to see my bills on-line Thank you Dean. Derek Andrews
4148|Was unsure about how smoothly the switch over of energy suppliers would go, with handing over the sourcing to a 3rd party, but UtilityWise were very friendly, reassuring and effective. Have had no issues and we have moved to our new suppliers with no fuss. Would not hesitate to recommend UtilityWise, especially if you are in a small company juggling lots of different jobs. The only reservation I still have is that, to know if I am getting a good deal I will still have to check prices elsewhere myself. That said, we have got a great deal this year and so will just have to see what prices are offered at renewal time.
4149|Very friendly and professional service from all 
4150|I used Utilitywise for the first time 2 years ago on a half hourly metering contract, when they were able to get the best terms for the contract. I was contacted again this year with plenty of time before the renewal date and once again they have been able to get the best prices for the renewal. The individual that deals with my contract is very helpful, replies to my emails promptly and has made the renewal process easier.
4151|very helpful, friendly and most of all knowledgable
4152|we have used utility wise for the past two years and they have always found us the best deals with the least hassle. Cant fault the services from these guys, always go above and beyond to help out!
4153|Utilitywise have worked with us for a few years and always get you the best deal.  You have the personal touch, when they come out to see you and you always feel that they genuinely want to get you the best deal.  They are always on the end of the phone if you require any assistance with queries you may not be able to answer.  It is the first time that we have received regular invoices for our gas and electricity and now are able to audit our heating bills.  We recommended this company to another group who also used them.
4154|good to know these guys are out to negotiate through the maze that is utility supply
4155|The agent rang us and we were due to be rolled he arranged a 3 year contract cheaper then my current 1 amazing!!!
4156|When I first established my restaurant, I was contacted by Utilitywise through a friends recommendation to help me set up my energy contracts. They were very helpful and helped me find the best deal! Would definitely recommend them!! I really liked the ease of using them and the professional and polite manner of the customer service I received, plus getting an excellent price!
4157|Gareth Charlton was true to his word and found me a better tariff. I never normally even get into dialogue with people on the phone because if something is too good to be true, it probably is! However this deal seemsto have been of benefit.A couple of times when Gareth wasn't available I didn't think it was going to be any good, but eventually it all worked out well.
4158|After taking the call from the agent he told me how he could save me over GBP500 swapping my domestic tariif over to a Business tariff as i work from home. effortless transfer and he sorted everything for me.
4159|After having many calls from utility companies most of which have been very annoying, i found Lawrence from Utility Wise most helpful without being pushy & would most definitely recommend! We shall see how much money they save me!
4160|I have used Utilitywise for nearly 2 years for both of my sites. Ricky gosling has been very helpful and found my business the best deals. I would recommend the service!
4161|The agent made the experience less painful than doing it direct, good service.
4162|Hopefully Lewis has found me the best deal with gas and electricity suppliers.  Very smooth and trouble free transition.
4163|I do not normally take to cold callers but on this occasion the person calling appeared affable enough. The person was not too pushy and we had a reasonable conversation which after a number of follow up call lead me to sign up.
4164|Thank you so much to the agent For how quickly and efficient she sorted my Gas and Electric contracts out. 
4165|Efficient seamless transfer to new supplier at a satisfactory electricity rate for a fixed period as required. Would not hesitate to use again.
4166|I e-mailed to ask if they would review the renewal contract offered to the Church by our current suppliers and I had a call back as soon as my e-mail was received.I was impressed by the personal service and the speed with which our request was dealt with.The result was a saving for us coupled with a five year contract which will give peace of mind and assist with future budgeting.There was nothing in my dealings with ethe company that I disliked.
4167|The representative for Utility Wise was extremely helpful in guiding me through the maze of energy companies and technical jargon that I didn't understand to get the best deal for the company I work for. Utility Wise have been very professional in dealing with the existing energy company and the the new provider making it a seamless transition. I have been very impressed with the level service and would not hesitate in recommending Utility Wise to other businesses and friends.
4168|We have had nothing but complete satisfaction from Utility Wise. Their staff are friendly and well informed. Will use them when our contract is up for renewal. Keep up the good work. Claire from Clay Cross Angling
4169|Understood our needs from the start.  Very quick as responding to questions and obtaining quotes, we have managed to save on both our Gas and Electricity.  Setting up contracts was simple.  Excellent customer service from Sales guy.
4170|I've had a really good experience with Utilitywise and it was a pleasure to deal with the agent - so warm and friendly and helpful. The company appears to me to be very professional.
4171|I would recommend this service to all business who have multiple sites or multiple different utility providers. Utilitywise streamlined this process for the business getting us comprehensive and competitve pricing deals as well as taking responsibility for dealing with any of our energy supplier queries or requests. I found the utilitywise member of staff we are in communication with to be extremely helpful, very professional and always communicates in an efficent and timely manner. We are very happy with the level of service we have received from Utilitywise to date.
4172|The sourcing of energy in todays market is a daunting exercise which occupies valuable company time and resources .Having pursued numerous suppliers and obtained countless pricing schedules, most of which are offered on different formats with countless obscure Terms and Conditions,  to say the least one is confused within this vast minefield of suppliers/ brokers, consultants etc and all their respective pricing formats.Dealing with Utilitywise,the hassle was totally removed and all competitive price schedules were presented in a logical and understandable format from which immediate business,economic and environmental decisions could be made with confidence.The friendly communications verbally and electronically porvided the confidence and assurance of total commitment and support 
4173|Have always found Utilitywise as a firm you can rely on for excellent service and under the guidence of Kirkb Wilson can thoroughly recomend it to anyone. 
4174|After initial contact by the agent enquiring as to whether we would like to change our energy supplier,we decided to let Utility wise find us the best deal for our needs. The agent has always been attentive,supportive,helpful friendly and very approachable which is one of the reasons we agreed to go ahead. We now have a very good deal with Total, prices set until 2019. Well done and thank you. We would recommend to others.
4175|The agent who first contacted me in November 2012 explained the services utillitywise could offer, in a clear and concise manner. It was an effortless experience on my part and come the renewal of my electricity contract, I was immediately switched to a more appropriate and ultimately cheaper provider.All in all a very valuable excercise for my business.
4176|Utilitywise called me out of the blue and persuaded me to sign up for a new electricity contract, although our present contract doesn't expire for almost a year. I don't like the way they did it. They quoted figures over the phone and wanted to sign me up immediately. Before I knew it they were recording the call and I was agreeing to a new contact with Total Power and Gas. When the confirmation came through the cost per Kwh was over 50% more that we are presently paying with E-On. Also there are strict clauses in the contract that prevent early termination without high penalties. The problem with these phone contracts is they read out terms and conditions to you but you don't get time to absorb the information, and you can't sit down and read the contract, they put you on record and you have to agree on the spot. It is not a good way to do business. I would not deal with them again and I have been losing sleep thinking that I have committed the Company to high future expenditure. I should not have taken their call. 
4177|The agent has been a pleasure to deal with at Utilitywise and has gone out of his way to help out in any way possible and provide the best service possible an absolute credit to the company. Brilliant service and I would recommend Utilitywise, a great company to deal with!
4178|We received some great help and guidance from the agent and this company. We would highly recommend them to anyone looking for someone who can find the best deals 
4179|I dealt with Linzi Potts in my quest to find the best electricity supply deal for our company once our current contract expires early next year. Linzi was very clear in her explanations, especially the merits of the various options (e.g. one year v three year v five year deals). She was enthusiastic, efficient and had a very pleasant telephone manner which made understanding of the situation that much easier. Because of Linzi I would definitely recommend Utilitywise. Peter Churcher on behalf of Anthony Harding & Partners Limited
4180|We are a multi meter site. We had different suppliers for different meter's. Utilitywise and in particular the agent took the complication away from us enabling us to concentrate on our business. As an added bonus he also managed to reduce our bill significantly. Very happy with the service given.
4181|Utility wise arranged my electricity supplier to best one on market my advisor did a brilliant job she called me several times to make sure i new every step of the way and with various quotes kept me updated till we found best deal i was very imppresed with amount they saved me and how much work and time spent with me would highly recommend utility wise to anyone thanks best one minimart t singh
4182|Jason rang and asked if could help with the renewal of our energy account, he was very helpful, nothing too much trouble.
4183|LM was very efficient and followed things up for me. Nice to have someone else to do all the leg work.Would recommend to others
4184|We used Utilitywise when transferring our gas & electric services from private to business for parts of our expanding premises. The representative was very helpful and friendly, and arranged a 3 year contract for us covering all parts of our property, which we are very happy with. Not only did Utilitywise make the transfer process much easier for our business, but they also negotiated a great rate for us. We would definitely recommend Utilitywise, and will continue to use them in the future.  
4185|- Personal Service- Good Timescales- Very informative- Very Helpful- Willing to go that extra Mile- Great cusotmer service Skills
4186|KS contacted me with a view to changing our energy supplier.  He explained everything clearly, in an understandable way.  He sourced the cheapest and most suitable company for our needs, negotiated the deal and arranged all aspects of the changeover.  The service was efficient, KS was very professional in his approach with no pressure at all.  We are extremely satisfied with our energy supplier and all aspects of the management of our account by KS at Utilitywise.  I have no negative issues at all.
4187|We were telephoned by the agent  representing Utility Wise, to enquire if he could help us with looking for a deal on our electricity for when our current contract was due for renewal. We appear to have a good deal and better still it has been done with the minimum of effort and hassle, on our part, well in advance of the contract renewal date. The agent was enthusiastic,like all salespeople in this industry, but he kept it respectful, and we were kept informed throughout the process. 
4188|Fantastic customer service, would most definately recommend.
4189|Being in charge of two practices can be a tuff job, and where energy contracts are concerned I now have a account manager that has helped me secure contracts that not only save money but help me with my day to day work. He has been fantastic and continues to impress me with everything he is doing for the company. Thank you Lynne McCormick Practice manager
4190|Friendly, efficient, easily understood, answered all of my questions.Good service and not pushy.
4191|I have been dealing with Utilitywise for a number of years now and have nothing but praise for the service provided and the professional friendly manner of the two agents I have dealt with over those years.   I have 7 meters to deal with both gas and electric all renewing contracts at different times in the year.  When working in a busy office these renewal dates can easily be overlooked - but Utilitywise contact me every time to arrange for a review prior to covering the renewal. Excellent. 
4192|Have been dealing with the agent , she has been very helpful, could not ask for a better service.
4193|I was sceptical when I was first contacted about utility Wise, as everyone seems to be offering to reduce gas & electricity prices, but since taking up the offer I have been more than pleasantly surprised at the savings I have been able to make
4194|We moved into a new business premises and required an energy supplier, we used Utility Wise and it could not have been easier. The help we received was second to none, polite, informative and efficient. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to friends and business colleagues. 
4195|Very efficient and well informed on all rates available at the time of contact relating to our premises. We were allowed sufficient down time to discuss the new rates on offer, without being pressurized to conclude a sale.Once agreed,the new contract was completed effortlessly and with out any further problems. All in all, we were extremely satisfied with the serviceprovided.
4196|Jason Atkinson rang me as our gas and electricity were due for renewal he was very helpful and succeeded in getting me a two year fixed rate that I was very pleased with I would certainly recommend Utility Wise to my friends and other companies
4197|We were contacted by Utility wise to see if they could help us with securing a good deal on our electricity, when the current contract comes up for renewal.The member of staff was very personable and had a nice balance of enthusiasm without being too pushy, and was extremely good at getting back to me when he said he would.He seems to have secured a good deal for us, and it's all done well ahead of time, which has hopefully provided us with a better deal rather than waiting until nearer the time, and also it's done, so no mad panic nearer the time.
4198|I have used Utilitywise now for 2 years and I find that Gareth takes the hard work out of comparing prices for our utilities. This is really helpful as doing the accounts for 2 hair and beauty salons I do not have the time to do this thoroughly.
4199|I was happy to deal with this Company because there wasnt too much pressure and if I was too busy they seemed happy to call back at my convenience.  He was extremely polite and was looking after the Company's interest at all times.
4200|The agent from Utilitywise recently contacted me and was able to source and implement new gas and electricity deals for my business. He did all the work leaving me to, hopefully, enjoy a good deal with no hassle. He compared prices from several companies and was able to advise on which to take. If I had to do the searches then the endlless paperwork of cancelling the old contract etc. I would never have bothered. Thank you
4201|Utilitywise have helped me over the years take the stress and strain out of renewing my gas and electricity contracts.  They make diary reminders to contact me so that I have plenty of time to get the most preferential rate for my new contract.  I would have no hesitation in recommending Utilitywise to a friend or company.  
4202|utillitywise were very helpfull they took all the stress and worryfrom me .they found me the best prices for both gas and electrictyand are only a phone call away if i have any problems.i would recomend them to friends and family
4203|I was very impressed with the service i received. The chap was very efficient and i didnt have to call him up at any time as he called me when he said he would call. He had a good manner, very cheery and when i didnt have the info to hand there was never a problem him calling me back, asking when it suited me.I dont have anything negative to say about the service. As long as the change over goes as smooth i will be happy.
4204|We had moved our business premises and your staff helped make this stressful task regarding utilities very easy. My questions didn't seem to irritate them and they answered everything in a way that was easy to understand.
4205|Cannot fault the service received from start to finish, changing suppliers is always daunting but when it is carried out as by Utilitywise it is easy no pressure from salesmen - KS handled everything perfectly.  Cannot write about what didn't like as there was nothing to report
4206|I can't fault the service that we have had from Utility Wise so far.  From start to finish we've been made to feel important and that our account manager is working for us, to get us the best deal he can.Having a dedicated, friendly account manager who has got to know our company has made a pleasant change from previous experiences. I know when I telephone or email that I won't have to explain a lengthy history, and that my query will be dealt with quickly. The friendly service has continued long past making a sale when other companies tend to lose interest.Overall we are really glad that we chose to use Utility Wise and don't anticipate this changing at any time in the future
4207|Saves time trawling through the big energy suppliers when looking for price comparisons.
4208|We are an organisation with several companies within the group.  We were approached by Scott Robson from Utility Wise about a year ago when our accounts were due for renewal.  Scott proved to be thoroughly efficient, professional and completely understood our entire requirements.  We spent time explaining how our business's work and he took everything we said on board before coming back to us with his proposal.  He was and still remains to be available at any time to discuss our business needs and his product knowledge is second to none.  The advice he gave us was accurate and his no nonsense approach was exactly what we would expect from a professional.  Scott is an absolute asset to the Utility Wise organisation and a pleasure to do business with.
4209|I have been dealing with Utilitywise for over 12 months I found that they were ready to help me to sort out the best deals for my company. Calls are answered straight away with very friendly and knowledgeable staffI would not hesitate to recommend them saving you time and money   
4210|My company used Utilitywise to switch its gas & electricity supply. The level of professionalism of the consultant involved with our account was excellent and we would have no hesitation in using them again once our current contract expires.In addition I would have no hesitation in recommending Utilitywise to others.
4211|The operator with whom I have been dealing at Utilitywise has been very helpful, friendly and polite. Clear explanations have been provided in relation to how savings can be achieved.  Utilitywise takes the hassle away from busy managers is shopping around for the best energy deal.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend their services.
4212|I have received some wonderful help and guidance from this company and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for someone who can find the best deals
4213|We were approached by the agent with regards to our energy supply. She worked the market and we are now enjoying new fixed rates, which are cheaper than before. The whole process was seamless and hassle free. She was always helpful, professional and friendly. We would have no problems in recommending Utility Wise to any other business. 
4214|During my dealings with Utility Wise I was always impressed with the politeness, efficiency and accuracy of the call center operators. I was given many options to chose from including green energy and even UK tax payers. I was given a range of terms and of prices varying in unit costs and standing charges and I had explained to me the differences these options would have on my business. The process of employing Utilitywise was simple and they made the contract agreement very simple. I would have no problem recommending UtilityWise to other companies.
4215|We have both our gas and electricity contracts via UtilityWise.  They have saved us a considerable amount of money over our last suppliers.  We have alrways found them very helpful and efficient. Nothing negative to report. Would recommend them to any business!Aztec Cleaning Services Ltd
4216|Extremely pleasant salesman and always bright, cheerful and chatty, nothing too much trouble for him and searched several companies to find the best one, helpful but not pushy and gave me prices and time to think so that I could compare the pro's and con's myself. I have not long changed over to the new Electricity company so can't comment on the company yet but when it comes to renewing the contract I shall certainly give Utilitywise a call first.
4217|The service was excellent.  Took away all the trawling through suppliers every year.  Being a charity you don't always have the time to search everything out there.  It was very helpful to have someone to do it for you and come with the best deal.  Also having one person to deal with throughout your contract is also helpful as you know who to speak too with any problems not that there has been any!!
4218|After a few initial hiccups due to the number of both gas and electricity accounts we have within our centre, the service and backup service has been excellent.  In particular Bobby Robson has been very conscientious and kept an eye on our accounts, renewing where necessary and keeping me up to date at all times. I would recommend this service.
4219|The whole switching process was pain free for me.  Everything that could have been done, was done and when they said it would be.  My contact was very helpful and friendly.
4220|Very good service to ensure that you have the best deal when moving energy suppliers. The agent was very efficient, took the hassle out of the procedure and kept me informed every step of the way (even if he does have more neck than a giraffe!)
4221|Speedy service to save us time & money!Thanks very much!
4222|The sevice provided by the agent on behalf of Uttilitywise has been very satisfactory We have found him friendly and helpful.
4223|I was approached by telephone from this company who offered to help improve my Electricity tariff.  After a few exchanges of correspondence, they managed to get my tariff reduced and I am happy. They took the leg work out of something that I kept putting off, due to lack of time.Thank you.
4224|I found the agent extremely helpful and patient in all my dealings with him. I believe he found me the most competitive price for our companies energy suppliers.

He was keen to save the company money not matter how small the saving and arranged all the processes efficiently, we kept up to date at all stages and I would recommend your services to other businesses. Our new contract commences in January so long may your services continue. Great branding and welcome pack!Regards,

They sorted the best deal possible for our company both unit price and standing charge, she has cancelled our current contract with n power and set up the new one with total. thanks again. keith turnbull Houghton body shop.
4230|I found Utility Wise very helpful in finding a great deal for the company I work for and having used them before they have always found superb prices for the electricity and gas. I have to say that the allocated personal advisor which was given was really freindly, helpful, gave really good advise and has kept in touch to see how things were going.I would recommend them again to others.   
4231|Thanks to the agent for all the hard work she saved me a lot of money !!!! First class service hope to deal with her again
4232|Very good service to ensure that you have all the relevant information to switch your energy provider to the best deal.Bobby Robson (what a great name!)was very efficient  and kept me informed every step of the way. Excellent.
4233|"I recently had the good fortune of receiving a call from the agent  from Utilitywise. The call started and I thought it was the usual sales call with all the ""spiel"" and I did what I usually do and said to send me an email with the details. It was my normal fob off as I get sales calls all the time from companies who want to make my life easier and save me money. The difference was the agent, he actually did what he said he would do, which is a rarity. He kept me informed of everything that was going on, he communicated with me all of the options and answered any questions I had. The contract was not plain sailing but that was because of my supplier at the time and he used all of his knowledge and experience to achieve the result I had asked for. I have since recommended him to other clients and will continue to do so. On a personal level he is a really really nice, genuine guy. On a professional level he is very good at his job and does what he says he will do without the hard sale. You don't feel pressured to work with him and he is easy to talk to which when talking through multiple sites and huge numbers of meters is a joy."
4234|Having been with Utilitywise for a few years now, I have found them to be very helpful over our years of involvement, and recently Bobby has been advising us very well. The advisors are never pushy, always helpful and do review your account on a regular basis. Never one to miss an opportunity he advised us to take up the offer of an extension to our contract to secure a fixed rate until 2017! Eat your heart out Ed......
4235|The agent was persistent in his aim to convert us to Utilitywise which turned out very well for us. We don't have massive electricity bills but I'm sure they're now as low as we could hope for in a complex world of competing utilities. I'd rather someone else spent their time dealing with all that than me so I'm very pleased.
4236|Excellent staff attitude, friendly and always at the other end of the phone when you need them, even after you sign the contract. They offer support durning the life of your contract and when things do not go right, they always strive to put it right in No time. They always recommend the best and efficient price that suits your need. Excellent local business serving local people. Our business saved hundreds of pounds thanks to Utility Wise 
4237|The service I recieved from the agent, after I was unexpectedly made supervisor within our company, was exceptional. She was very thorough in the explanation of all processes and effectively brought me up to speed with the whole process. The customer experience I recieved was brilliant and I felt completely at ease that the service offered would go ahead complete smoothly. The financial benefits are a positive, that goes without saying but knowing our energy supply will not be interupted and our change over is being handled in such a professional manner, takes away any concerns that myself or our board of directorsmay have.
4238|Provided good advice on future price movements and set up a suitable contract locking in a very competitive price for a good period of time. This will save us significant energy costs, and having them monitor renewal in due course, saves us a lot of time and worry in an area where we are not experts, but they are.
4239|Utility wise are great, I can rely on them sorting the best prices and I do not have to anything except say yes thats fine, would highly recommend utility wise to anyone, it saves me lots of hassle and time thanks again.
4240|Utilitywise are the first company who have ever been able to better the utility prices we could get direct from our suppliers! Furthermore, having Curtis as a dedicated point of contact has been a pleasure, personal service,easy to deal with and always cheerful, makes life so much easier. Would happily recommend Utilitywise services to others.
4241|The agent from Utilitywise was excellent from start to finish. He was very thorough and ensured he got us the best deals, even calling up a couple of days later to say he'd found a better one! We were very pleased and have saved money. The service was superb, I would be happy to recommend.
4242|We are a small business, however have a number of meter's, both gas and electric at a couple of locations, Utility Wise have helped us manage our power supply needs and got us great deals in the process, personal and friendly service and great communication.   
4243|I was happy with the service provided with Utilitywise, especially as they have managed to get a common end date for 6 of our supplies which I have been looking to achieve for several years. I was kept updated at all times and they were able to use the information that I provided to create a useful summary of all of our supplies. I have dealt with several utility consultants over a number of years, and I would recommend Utilitywise above others.
4244|After all the awful cold calling from energy companies it was such a relief talk to a company that were polite and professional and got my company a good deal on energy. Mark Emms was great from start to finish. Thanks again. Paul, Sea View Motor Co.
4245|We were contacted by the agent in regards to the supply of our companies Electricity and Gas and future supply. Once we supplied the information required ie the meter numbers the whole process went very smoothly and Utilitywise we very helpful in getting good rates going forward and sorted out the various suppliers we had into a more controllable package. We would recommend Utilitywise to others looking for good fixed rate supply and consolidation of Utility supplies.
4246|We used Utilitywise as our energy brokers for sometime and have always received a first class service from them.They always got us great energy prices and made the whole thing very simple and stress free. Our energy consultant was always extremely polite & helpful. Any problems I may have had with our suppliers ways always dealt with quickly and efficiently. I would happily recommend Utilitywise and if he was their consultant they would be in very capable hands.
4247|As a charity we find it increasingly difficult to ensure we are getting the correct rates and prices for our electricity and gas. Utility Wise took all of the hassle and time out of finding the most competitive rates and prices, ensuring that the charities utility bills are kept as low as possible especially in these hard times. I would recommend this service to any company or charity as it is very personal and efficient, taking all the time and hassle out of shopping around for quotes. Utility Wise have ensured we have a seamless and swift changeover of providers. 
4248|We are a small homeless charity based in Birkenhead and as we took over properties and expanded our accommodation base for homeless people, we encountered all sorts of issues around the electricity supply, particularly with a derelict pub we took over to renovate.In a stroke of luck, we were put in contact with Scott Robson from Utility Wise. He immediately took over for us, keeping us informed at every step of the way what he was doing, suggesting what would work and what wouldnt. Its extremely difficult sometimes to get through to the right departments etc and Scott took over all of this for us.All is now up and running smoothly...something that would have taken far longer and increasing levels of frustration if it hadnt been for this companyHooray for Utility Wise we say and in particular to the inestimable Scott Robson !
4249|Utility Wise are an honest and reliable energy review company, The customer relation manager was fantastic - no hard sell, honest advise the benefited my company over anything else Regards John Davidson Tom Brown Wholesale
4250|I am very happy with the service provided,I was informmed well about my options and based on that have chosen the electricity provider. The transmission was smooth without any problem. I was supported by one of your employee who skillfully answer all my questions.It was veery easy to contact him.
4251|Since the utilities were sold off there has been no good news for consumers and I had accepted this as the status-quo. Then a friend suggested that I tried Utilitywise. This was one piece of good advice, and I found a breath of fresh air at last. I spoke one of their staff . He was very friendly, efficient and effective in sorting us out with much more advantageous tariffs. These also carried a longer contract period than before so we can relax in the interim knowing that we have a hedge against the pre-winter increases that will be coming along. A big thank you!   
4252|Utilitywise have been looking after our electricty contracts for several years now and the service they provide is excellent. Our office contract is up for renewal and the agent has been dealing with this on our behalf. He has been very helpful sourcing us the best prices for the type of meter we have, and is very friendly. Dealing with Utilitywise is much easier and straight forward than dealing direct with the utility company, and I would thoroughly recommend them.
4253|Was contacted by Victoria Etherington who was extremely helpful and had all relevant information at her fingertips.  Would definitely recommend to others.
4254|I have recently set up an electricity contract for one of our sites with Utilitywise. I found the staff very helpful and efficient in dealing with our business. Our company had dealt with Utilitywise previously and I have never been unsatisfied with the service given hence the reason for more business this year. I think that price does matter but its really about getting the right balance of price and service. Any time I have had any questions regarding our contract with Utilitywise it has been very easy to contact them and get a quick response.
4255|As a small local charity we are forever being contacted by various service providers who in reality after the initial 'cold call' fail to deliver the promised service and / or assistance. Utilitywise has proven to be the exception with,Jayne Robson their customer relations manager, not only delivering on her promise of  reduced electricity costs but also having a high standard of customer support in ensuring that we fully understood the process,documents and subsequently achieved this goal of reducing our operational costs. Small charities like ourselves are struggling in the current recession so Jayne's understanding, help and professional / personal manner has been greatly appreciated.  
4256|I would definitely recommend Utilitywise. Nice and easy to deal with and takes the hassle out of the very time consuming process of searching for and changing to the best provider.
4257|This was a very simple and effective service. After moving premises we were looking to make improvements on the current service contracts that were in place and Utilitywise helped and assisted in this process. I would defiantly both recommend and use this service again in the future.RJL Precision Engineering Ltd
4258|Really top service from these guys, wouldn't hesitate to reccomend, and really friendly too!
4259|We have found Utilitywise an easy company to work with. They have taken the hard work out of negotiating contracts for gas or electricity and given the cost effective option of being part of a bulk buying programme which reduces cost. The service has with out a doubt saved us money at our 2 sites. Mark Gregory E-Commerce Manager
4260|i would like to thank Bobby for his swift service allowing our change of provider to be very smooththanks
4261|As a small business, keeping utility costs as low as possible is a concern. We had come to the end of our contracts with existing suppliers and I was faced with the daunting task of shopping around for the best deal. Luckily someone told me about Utilitywise, I called them and it only took a short time to gather the information they needed to find us the best deal, I will definetley use them again when we come to the end of the next deal we are on. 
4262|Taking care of over 50 commercial sites you can imagine utilities is a huge exercise to ensure contracts are maintained and to keep on top of ever changing energy tariffs - I am so grateful to Utilitywise, more particularly the Energy Consultant, without whom I believe I would be working 24/7. Utilitywise manages all our utility contracts now and has proved to be professional, efficient and friendly. He is always accessible and knows his stuff - leading me through the maze of tariffs and making sure best prices are always achieved. Cannot thank them enough for all their hardwork. I would 100% recommend Utilitywise.
4263|We have used Utility Wise for the past 3 years. On each contract renewal they have searched out the most relevant and economic deal available, and remind us about when our current contract is about to expire. Our consultant ensures that all queries and administration matters are dealt with promptly and efficiently.
4264|I would have no hesitation in recommending Utilitywise. They were easy to deal with, very helpful and made the whole process simple and straightforward.
4265|We have used your company more than once to source for the best deal available with regards to an electricity provider. The member of staff that we deal with is always very knowledgable and willing to go that extra mile to make sure that we are a satisfied customer. Dealing with any queries that may arise. Working in a busy office we don't always have the manpower and time it takes to source this information ourselves and therefore we find using a company such as yours is an asset. We currently have a query with regards to a renewal of an electricity contract and I am sure that your colleague will be able to resolve this issue very soon.
4266|Changing over utility suppliers has always been very confusing for me in the past, especially for my business, but the young man who I dealt with made it so easy.   He was able to answer all my questions and was very knowledgeable.  At no time did I feel pressurised and it was obvious that I was being treated as a human being.  I felt that the most important person in the whole changeover was me and my business.  
4267|After many false starts in the arrangement of power supply I was so grateful to come across Utilitywise - I have no problem in recommending them.  The service is personal, prompt and efficient, saving me money and a lot of headache.
4268|If you want someone who goes that extra mile to find out your real energy needs so they can find the right supplier for you, give Utility Wise a whirl.The advisor who helped me made it his business to treat me as an individual. By understanding what was important to me he was able to explain why one supplier should be considered over another.Of course I wanted excellent rates but I also needed to know what increases were likely in the near future and this made it easier to consider fixing the offer for an extended period.Even Utility Wise don't have a crystal ball but the sure have advisors with enough sense and experience to suggest what priorities are important to me, making it easy to choose from the offers obtained.I didn't feel pressurised to accept anything at any point and i'm enjoying cheaper energy supplies over an agreed extended term.
4269|I would recommend utilitywise as the agent found us a long term electricity supplier at good rate. Her customer service was very good and always at the end of the phone if you needed to ask a question.
4270|I got a call back in January from the agent , he highlight a number of discrepancies with my current provider. This brought to light the fact that i was being basically being ripped off. After about 5 calls I fully understood how the energy world works, i couldnt thank him more for his effort and patience when dealing with us, because we are so busy he worked out out a way to save around GBP300 pounds a year.
4271|Used Utilitywise for the first time and found them to be extremely helpful and managed to renew contract with our existing supplier at competitive rates, with very little work on my part. I found Victoria Urwin particularly helpful after a slightly dodgy start with another member of staff
4272|I run a small barbershop, the agent had a look over my bills, which I was convinced were good. I found that not only were the prices he obtained better than my renewals, they were also cheaper than my previous contracts, and were fixed for 5 years, which is a godsend for someone like me who knew was not as knowledgable as I thought on the energy market. Have recommended him to other businesses.
4273|Happy with the service we received. Great outcome. would recommend
4274|I would like to thank the agent for her efforts and cooperation in helping me and my business get the best rate around. Being a loyal customer i thought i would be getting the best rates from my supplier but when she came back with prices i would have been daft to say no to the prices. Job well done. i would use this service over and over and looking forward to listening to the Geordie tone the next time my comtracts are due. Thankyou for the hard work and efforts.
4275|I had a broker for 5 years and never listened to any other consultants. The agent managed to convince me to get another price from another broker. He fully explained the difference between pass through and fully fixed half hourly contract, something our existing broker had not done in 5 years. His pass through and fully fixed prices were as promised cheaper and inevitably he is now my broker. Thanks!
4276|I received a call from Scott Ilderton at utilitywise and he really helped me with some issues I was having with gas and electricity supply. He showed that service comes first. He looked into everything with me and helped my understand what had happened. He was offered a much more beneficial package that I was happy to accept and he is a credit to your company. 
4277|As a charity we need to look for good value and a consistent service. Utlitywise quickly found us long term gas and electricity services with minimal fuss.
4278|Lawrence was a great representative of the company. He was friendly and not pushy. He had a great manner and explained everythin clearly and got us cheaper electricity and gas. As a charity we are always looking for the best deals. Top class! He was interested and treated me as a person and was not purely interested in the sale. 
4279|I have used utilitywise since March when the agent contacted me. I decided to allow them to look into my energy supply contracts. I was thrilled with the service and advice i received and have had many great conversations with him on a personal level as well as business. So glad i received the call!
4280|I was using another consultant for years and when I spoke to Gaurav I will never use anyone else. He made it so simple and we saved about GBP15,000 on our gas and electricity contracts compare to our previous consultant. Highly recommended. Can not think anything that I did not like.
4281|Having purchased a large industrial estate which was in receivership the electricity bills were huge and, as there were several separate units, the situation was confusing. Utilitywise sorted out everything really quickly, from finding new suppliers at very competitive rates and getting standing charges removed to advising on how best to invoice tenants. I think I would still be wading through it all now if Bobby hadn't sorted it out. I would definitely recommend them. 
4282|Mark Emms contacted us around a year ago to help us search the market for the best energy prices, with having 6 meters and the service being free of charge I thougt why not. Mark not only saved us time and money but managed to arrange the contracts all with one supplier and also align all the contracts to finish at the same time. This was very helpfully as we have been caught out in the past. I will be using Utilitywise in the future.
4283|My account manager contacted me as he lives local and i felt we had a strong understanding of what i wanted from my contracts. He has taken over our Electric contract and took the headache away from us. he kept us informed of what was happening every step of the way. I can now focus on running my business and leave everything in his capable hands. I could not give enough praise to the company and i hope to refer many of my friends . Thank you David Walpert
4284|I get bombarded by calls about energy, I use about as much electric for my business as my daughter uses to straighten her hair, I also couldn't really care who I'm with as long as I don't have to spend time talking them on the phone sorting out my massive 100 a month bil, then a lad from utilitywise phoned me, he was a normal lad, who was quick and straight to the point he said that he didn't care who I was with as long as i was happy and that he could put me too any supplier, tailored to what I want from a supplier, I said a supplier that doesn't bother me 24/7, so off he went and came back with three offers, I took a more expensive option as I was imformed that this supplier wouldn't bother me and they have been perfect, if I ever need to discuss my massive 130 quid a month bill I will speak to my man at utilitywise, thanks again Worst thing is he is a Newcastle fan Cheers John
4285|We have two gas supplies, one of which we do not require, and were faced with either a huge bill to remove it or a continuing standing charge. Utilitywise have negotiated a contract which enables the one we use to be charged at a reasonable rate and the spare one to remain in situ without attracting extra charges. They have also negotiated elecricity rates for us.
4286|Gareth CharltonVery pleased with the overall service.Was very helpful and would be very happy to recommend to anyone. 
4287|Since using utility wise for our energy requirements, we have received excellent service, especially in solving quite a few problems we have had with gas supply. We have dealt with the agent throughout, and he has been polite and courteous , and always on hand at the end of the telephone. I would recommend this company for all your energy needs. 
4288|We found the agent to be very helpful, and efficient. He followed up to remind us when our contract with our existing supplier was comimg to an end , so we wont end up rolling over , and costing us a fortune. He quickly checked the market to find the best deal for us , and advised us when to act . once we were happy , he sent through the relevant documentation to be signed,which we sent back, and on my request confirmed receipt. The process was very quick and painless, and saves us having to search out the best /most cost effective provider for our company.Well done!
4289|Gareth Olds has taken all the hard work out of getting the best energy deals.
4290|Been using Utilitywise for a couple contracts now - great personal service which has kept us using them.Also takes the hassle of dealing direct with utility companies. Utilitywise kept me informed all the way through switches / contracts.I would recommend them.
4291|following a call from a very pleasant young lady. utilitywise have found us a cheaper energy supplier, the young lady was very efficient without being pushy, overall a hassle free money saving experience.
4292|The agent from Utilitywise has been extremely helpful. All and any questions answered and she managed to get us the best deals. Would recommend undoubtably to anyone looking for great service. Hope this is helpful!
4293|Brilliant service and patience by Gareth Charlton energy consultant.  Very helpful and saved me a lot of money.  Congratulations on having such a great employee.
4294|The agent called me to introduce Uitilitywise and I was impressed with his knowledge of his subject. Our company has yet to make the final decision to change electricity suppliers but when we do I will ask him to be the one to implement it.
4295|I've always found Utilitywise to be friendly, responsive and very capable and would not hesitate to recommend them to others.  In the past we have got some good deals with the minimum of fuss and each phase of the process has been explained so that there were no 'surprises' during the transition from one provider to another.
4296|Fantastic service from the agent, any queries answered promptly with the promise of returned calls always made without any delay. would recommend this company if you are looking at new suppliers.
4297|Very pleased with the service offered, and the speed and professionalism dealt with on the phone.Will certainly suggest this to other businesses.
4298|Victoria Unwin, called me to introduce herself and explain about Utility Wise.I have got to say she was great, and gave me all the information  i needed to make my choice.She was completely focused and so helpfull.
4299|Our company has been dealing with Utilitywise for a few years now with regard to our electricity and gas contracts and we have been very happy with the good prices we have received and the level of service.The switchover's have always happened very smoothly.I would highly recommend!
4300|I was approached by Utilitywise offering their services with a review into our gas and electric suppliers.  Having far too many calls from the suppliers directly it was wonderful to speak with a consulting company who could look at our company as a whole to see if we were with the right supplier at good rates.  I felt confident from the first conversation that it was the right choice to work with Utilitywise and I have found their approach very professional and efficient.  They are in regular communication and happy to help with any queries or concerns I have. I would happily recommend Utilitywise to any business.
4301|Bryan Lamport from Utility wise contacted me a couple of years ago and ever since I have had a stress free time with switching utility companies. The contact I had was informative useful and saved me money. The switch over has always been quick and easy even if contracts have been difficult to get out of !! Bryan has always been helpful courteous and dealt with every step of the way, I was a bit sceptical to use this company at first but I am glad I did as the time it has saved me scouting the market has been put to much better use. Carol Everest Veterinary Services
4302|After exhaustive review the agent successfully guided me to a cheaper tariff. All went very smoothly.
4303|Good,helpful service.Very efficient. You always get through to the advisor quickly.
4304|Great service from Bryan Lamport when we were in need of some new deals on our business Electricity and Gas back in 2012.The service since then has been first class and we have been constantly monitored and updated to ensure that we receive the best information in the market place.
4305|I was contacted by Victoria Urwin by phone and she put the offer to me quickly and in a way that was easy to understand. I needed time to assess the offer and as I was due to go on leave, Victoria emailed everything through. I was called back at the time that was arranged ,  making our decision was easy. All paperwork was easy to complete and no fuss. The offer represents a good saving on our current arrangements and not only that but it's fixed which is even better. Our current arrangements were up for review but like many SME's it kept getting pushed back. Having the fixed rate means we can now put this to one side safe in the knowledge that we're getting a good long term price for our needs. Thank you. 
4306|The agent has been excellent, from finding good deals to making the paperwork simple - and providing constant reminders to me.
4307|We have been dealing with Utilitywise over the past 2 years and have always found our account manager to be most helpful. She has sorted out all our gas and electricity accounts for eight warehouses with competative prices on fixed contracts. Her ongoing support over the past two years has been great and would say it has been a pleasure to deal with her. The service has been first class and would recommend your company to other businesses. Thank you so much Utilitywise.
4308|Dealt with an agent from Utility Wise who was professional and polite at all times. Great service, most imformative and he helped us to understand the services available in simple terms! Would not hesitate in using Utility Wise again. Many Thanks Anonymous 
4309|The agent has help me with our utility tender for the last 2 years. I have found him to be knowlegeble about his market, efficient, and extremly helpful.
4310|Being limited for time we found it very helpful to turn the task of comparing Electricity prices and finding the best rate for our company over to someone who had the time and experience. All we had to do was decide which company we wanted to go with once the comparison was delivered and the rest was done for us. Many thanks to Utility Wise I would not hesitate to recommend them 
4311|I would not hesitate to use Utility wise again.  Thank you.
4312|Helpful and friendly staff but I felt pressured to enter into a renewal contract, which would only start a year later, during the phone call. I am not sure how they decide to call their customers to offer them the best price. 
4313|Jayne Robson of Utility wise helped me to reduce my company energy cost by negotiating favorable rates. She provided excellent service, explained the cost and possible savings very well. I am very happy that I turned to Utility wise for helping me to create added value for my company. I recommend this free service to everyone! 
4314|After a terrible time trying to deal with Energy suppliers direct (including taking npower to ofgem) I discovered Utilitywise in an online search three years ago. Now this small charitable organisation uses them for all our energy contracts with great effect. They found great three year deals for us originally and now, well before the contracts end, have secured new deals at fixed prices to dream off. I would recommend any small organisation to use their free, efficient services and to reduce energy suppliers to the roll of slaves not masters!
4315|Not understanding too much about energy, Utility wise have helped explain and negotiate the best rates for our company.They gave us plenty of options for a business and helped us explore new ones for comparison to make sure we are getting the best deal.I was also quite late renewing our contract and Utility wise helped me out within a couple of days with a better rate than our current one.I would say they were easy to deal with and happy to help.
4316|We have always found utility wise to be friendly and helpful.  They take the hassle out of finding the best value for money for Gas and electric prices each year. We are a registered charity and they understand our needs for getting good value for money. If we have a problem with energy providers and I contact utility wise either by phone or email they respond quickly and sort the problems out.  Our experience has only been a positive one with utility Wise.
4317|All went smoothly, thanks.
4318|On behalf of NWRFC Ltd thanks for the great service provided in switching our energy supplier, it was very efficient. Excellent service.
4319|This service saved our organisation a lot of time, like many charitable groups we are feeling the pinch both finacially and in terms of capacity.  Having Utility wise do all the research in finding the best deals save me  lots of time and energy. the communciation was excellent with minimum time needed from our already busy staff.  We secured good long term deals which offered us security and financial reassurance at a difficult time. Brilliant, highly recommended service
4320|We are a mental health charity and about 18 months ago we decided it was time to overhaul all our utility contracts to make sure that we were getting the best deals for our 14 supported housing projects. We were encouraged to approach Utilitywise by the positive references we received from other offices of our charity nationwide.It was a huge relief to hand over all the time consuming legwork to our Utilitywise contact who is unfailingly helpful, courteous and chirpy. He has always kept us up to date with developments and deals and responds very quickly to queries made by phone or email. He has drawn up a spreadsheet showing full details of all our utility accounts which is hugely helpful.There is always room for improvement which is the only reason this is a 4 star review rather than a 5 star review. Because several of our properties now have the same account number with British Gas, their bills have become difficult to reconcile with our direct debits meaning that we have to phone them (probably monthly) for a breakdown).Overall, though, we have been very pleased with the service offered by Utilitywise.
4321|I found the contact I had to be a credit to the Utility Wise. She is very knowlegable, professional and helpful, giving a first class experience of Utility Wise and the services the company offers.
4322|By partnering with Utitiltywise, our company has saved significant amounts on our utility bills.  But for us, it is more than just the financial savings.  Over the years we have built up a strong working relationship. This allows to us act in confidence, knowing that Utilitywise are putting our interests at the top of their priority list.  They provide 360degree support for our company, allowing us to focus on other areas of the business.  It is extremely useful for us to have several Utilitywise employees at the end of the phone, willing to assist, covering a multitude of specific areas. 
4323|We have used Utilitywise for a few years now and are very happy with their service. It frees me up from having to deal with long phone calls to energy companies. I know with Utilitywise everything will be taken care of.
4324|The agent cold called us and offered to look at our utility contract to see if he could improve on the one we had. We are glad he did as the savings he managed to achieve for us really made it worth our while. He was efficient, friendly and explained everything very well. He made it very easy for us to switch contracts. He has kept in contact since to make sure we are happy with the service.
4325|Very enthusiastic and Efficient,making sure no matter how busy I was he always got to contact me and get the job done.
4326|Excellent help from our customer adviser in getting very good fixed term deals on both Gas and Electricity, this has saved us money and enabled us to budget for our company's utility bills. Very straightforward he did all the work for us and answered all our questions quickly and efficiently.
4327|I was and am very impressed with Utilitywise.  The product be it gas or electricity that we purchased through Utilitywise was explained in great detail and I was reassured throughout the whole process and always given a chance to ask questions whenever relevant.The transition from our old gas and electricity supplier to the new one provided through Utlitywise was smooth and unnoticeable. The aftercare that we have received has been excellent and if asked I would definitely recommend to other companies and friends.
4328|Overall outcome was excellent which involved examining a different option e.g. rates for energy for an SME business run from a domestic property.Previous Supplier made charges for daily rates which resulted in higher costs.Project showed wide variations in how Energy Suppliers deal with SME'S, or not at all! This required detailed comparisons, which were quickly resolved to company benefit.Utilitywise Consultant provided easy to undertand long term solution to  acheive objective.Nothing to get upset about - 
4329|Utiliywise cold called me, but I'm glad they did.  They provided a number of options and explained very clearly why the alternative energy suppliers had come up and what the saving would be.  Because we are a church it meant delays in agreeing to the new tariffs, but the staff were patient and if they promised to get back to me they did so on time and cheerfully did the recalculations.  Switching over couldn't have been easier.  I would definately recommend them.
4330|In EVERY telephone conversation with the agent at Utilitywise, she always went the extra mile to get my company the best deal available. I would have no problem in recommending Utilitywise to anyone and, in particular, the conscientious talents of her!
4331|Very impressed with the customer service provided to us at JB Consultancy by the agent at Utilitywise. Very professional and also friendly and helpful with prompt response times to any queries that we had.
4332|Initially I was sceptical about using an independent consultant to source our electricity, however Utilitywise came back with some great savings. The consultant was also a pleasure to deal with, extremely responsive and always went the extra mile to solve a few issues we had. I've already put him in touch with a colleague of mine.
4333|Victoria Urwin arranged everything for us, with no problems.Thanks for a great service.Imperial Cars
4334|we found the service provided by the agent very good. he was diligent and always provided up to date info proactively.

4337|The agent was very professional.. She was dogged in her approach which was needed, as we are always very busy... Even though she was persistent she was a pleasure to talk to.
4338|Utilitywise saved me money on my work utility bill comfortably and were not pushy when I put another account to them which they were not able to help with which is important to me.

4339|The agent dealt with our case efficiently and professionaly and succeeded in making us a saving on our utlity bills.
4340|UW staff are very professional,Very Friendly and helpful.Also got our company a very good deal.
4341|Joanne Illey from Utility Wisewas efficient, thorough and took into account our busy times. She has saved us money on our electric and hopefully gas when it comes up for renewal. She kept us informed at every step and so far it has been painfree and less hassle than trying to negotiate prices myself.
4342|Utility wise has been really helpful and caring through their Agent. Everything that she said that she would do was done immediately and precisely. Always phoning me back to confirm and also emailing for our records. Any problems that we had were no problem for her. She understood our issues precisely and sorted them all out without any fuss, taking the stress away from us at our end. I would definitley recommend this company as they have really looked after us and reduced our utility bills with a sensible contract length which suited our requirements. Full marks all round.
4343|HELPFUL... GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE...
4344|Grateful for the help given to our company by Utilitywise to find a way thru all the jargon and red tape of the energy suppliers with ease.
4345|I was contacted by Utilitywise around 6 months ago. I normally don't engage with companies trying to get you to change your utility suppliers. I listened what your representative had to say and felt confident in what she had to say about changing, so I agreed. She had a pleasant way with her, not too pushy! Any correspondence I have had with her since has been positive.
4346|My contract with my previous electricity supplier was due to renew. I did not realise i only have a day to notify to switch to the better deal. I was too busy  to do anything about it.  However, Jayne Robson from utility wise quickly found the best deal and act very efficiently. It is truly hustle free service.  Thank Jayne, without her, I would have been paying expensive electricity bill. 
4347|Gaurav was extremely helpful and persistant in ensuring he would provide a good deal for our business. He has done so.
4348|GREAT SERVICE, MADE THE SWITCH EASY AND SAVED US 40%
4349|We have been using Utilitywise for a number of years now and we would not change to another broker because of the excellent service provided by them. Its a huge burden lifted from us as I know Utilitywise get us the best 'deals' for our gas and electricity. Telephone calls are answered promptly and any queries are dealt with the minimum of fuss.  Its wonderful to be able to talk to a person instantly - without the 'press1  or press 2' and a robot droning on and on.  The staff are excellent - and even though we get inundated with calls from other brokers offering all sorts of deals, we know we are getting the best from Utilitywise and there is no hard sell - which is important.  Our personal contact person is brilliant.
4350|We were extremely pleased with the way Utilitywise sorted out a supplier for us when moving to a new building. They were very efficient, helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble and we have been very happy with the outcome.
4351|Excellent service, got straight on with the job in hand. Any teething problems were sorted out the same day Would recommend 
4352|The agent was extremely helpful and called just at the point when I was starting to get stressed about finding the best tariffs myself. He found the cheapest tarrifs really quickly and got things moving and sorted without me having to worry at all about it. He was very polite and friendly. I'm very happy with the service we received and would recommend this to other businesses, especially those who are very busy! 
4353|Utilitywise take all the stress out of sourcing energy suppliers.  They are always efficient, friendly, professional and never pushy.  I can rely on them to ring me and tell me exactly what is required.  Quite frankly, I couldn't manage without them.
4354|My contact is always helpful and friendly - and very patient with my sometimes idiotic and off-point questions.  Whatever I ask the response is always the same - if the answer is not immediately available, they promise to find out and get back to me - and they ALWAYS do.  Not to mention getting me the best deals currently available.  My contact even managed to pin down a supplier and get them to wait whilst my previous supplier fannied about umming and aahing about letting us go.  Thank you Utilitywise.
4355|The agent was very efficient, friendly and informative. I feel that he secured a good deal for us and it was uncomplicated from our end.
4356|Made navigating through the plethora of different tariffs and terms for our business gas supply so easy, and a pleasure to deal with. All the work done for you - who doesn't need that in a busy world ! Thank you Utility Wise
4357|Great service. Rang me every day with the prices letting me know when they changed (as they do daily. Kept trying to get the best prices until  I was totally happy with what they came up with. Glad I did wait as the initial price given was a lot less than what we signed up for. Phoned me constantly keeping me informed of what was happening and was very thorough with the Contract T&C;'s. Also saved me a lot of work trying to shop around for the best prices as that is very time consuming. Definitely would recommend to a friend!
4358|When it came to renewing our energy contracts I had been previously put off using any form of broker or outside company. However Kris Byrne from Utility Wise changed that. Kris offered excellent customer service, managed to get a brilliant deal after putting in a lot of hard work and going the extra mile. The service offered was professional and friendly.  I would recommend Kris and Utility Wise to anyone looking to renew their energy contracts. 
4359|Since using Utilitywise for our Gas & Electricity It has been a lot less stressful when renewal time arrived. This task can be very time consuming, I was spending days ringing around however after speaking to the agent and his collegues all the stress has gone. They have helped me hugely. After they have found the best quote for you, they then deal with all the transfers and paperwork. I find them a very useful service to have.
4360|Used Utilitywise to get some prices for my brewery. I was contacted by a Utiltuwise staff member who was able to get me a great deal very quickly that has allowed me to make some significant savings. He made thie whole process very easy and I can't thank him enough for this. I am very happy with the service received and would happily recommended this company to anyone.
4361|The service I received was great, staff were friendly and always called back at the times they said they would.Very efficient and I am pleased with my new energy supplier and rates.
4362|I hadn't heard of Utilitywise but I am glad they rang me! The help I received was invaluable.  The attitude was both friendly and professional. Only just signed up but they appear to have got me a very good deal.  Just had my first bills which seem alot better than before.  I would definitely recommend Utilitywise as they take away all the hassle of finding the best deal yourself.  In this very busy world we live in that is exactly what you want!Well done Utilitywise and thank you to the guy that helped me such alot.
4363|We received a call from the agent regarding our energy he was extremely friendly and helpful and although we were over 15 months away from our contract ending we received a free bill validation and he will most certainly be arranging our contracts when the time comes
4364|I feel that Utilitywise have always dealt with our company on a professional basis, offering sound & reliable advice & can be relied on to act on our behalf on a timely basis.
4365|We recently decided compare energy prices available due to rising costs. We approached Utilitywise and found them very helpful, in particular the agent , and he managed to secure a deal which will enable us to keep our energy costs at a reasonable level. We had to transfer supplier and this was all organised by Utilitywise and went very smoothly with a minimum of fuss.
4366|I would like to thank them for the great service, a lot of work has been done and all communications have been excellent calling back when said even down to the last minute. The service has been really friendly and very easy to discuss any queries I had, very approachable. Cannot praise them enough. Many thanks
4367|The time they have taken to help our Charity is fantastic. They are only a phone call or email away, and help you with your questions or queries straight away. They have helped us out alot with switching suppliers and i feel that anyone who ever needs help with switching should really reccomend utilitywise as they are the most fantastic, polite and patient people we have met. Thank you again utilitywise!
4368|Since using Utilitywise for our Gas & Electricity supplies from various sites we own, I have been a lot less stressful. This task can be very time consuming, however Bobby Robson has helped me hugely. He finds the best quotes for you, deals with all the transfers and paperwork. All you have to do is sign when you agree. I find them a very useful service to have. Also calls very so often to make sure all is well with all the sites.
4369|This Company has been a real asset to me.  Not only do they take on the annual revision of energy prices, including the cancellation, changeover, etc., my contact is very personable and easy to talk to.  He is excellent at explaining it all in layman's terms.  The best part is that it saves me so much time!! 
4370|Utility wise organised evrything for us. Got us the best deals on our supplies and even got rid of some of the standing charges. They organised contracts and helped us to close the old accounts. I would have been very confused with all of the different plans out there but they knew exactly what would be best for us. We gave them very little notice and they managed to hurry things along too.Always phoned to check if we needed any more help and if things were going ok.Great service, would recommend to anyone 
4371|Using Utilitywise was a great help as a small company we don't have the dedicated people to do these things or the time that is required.The person I dealt with was very good and very efficient and got me a good deal.
4372|Knowledgeable about the products - pleasant person to speak to very polite and willing to help 
4373|We are a small manufacturing company who used Utility Wise 2 years ago for our electricity contract. As promised they were straight back in touch before our contract was due to expire to find the best deal possible which they did the very same day. The product knowledge of the staff and their awareness of the current economic climate makes it really easy to understand the current deals and what would work best for our business. One minor issue was that Utility wise had our company set up twice and as such we have been inundated with phone calls from their offices to acquire our business. This was sorted out quickly by our energy consultant Mark Leeming who removed one of the companies from the system immediately. Even after signing up for a new 2 year contract Mark is helping with new issues that have arisen with our current meter. I cannot fault the service that we have received and would recommend Utility wise to any company wanting a stress free way to get the best energy prices.
4374|I was very pleased with the outcome.
4375|"To be fair I had not heard of utilitywise before, and one random day I got a phone call from a very friendly lady, we will call her Joanne.  I had had an issue with a electricity company and ""Joanne"" gave me some very helpful and informative advice that got me out of a very sticky situation that I should have never be in in the first place.  She also explained what she did in the company and how she could help and basically take over so I didn't get caught in the roll over trap again.  So after a few phone calls and emails I'm finally sorted.  The company as a whole is really good and very understanding of today's issues regarding monies and energy company's and she did her best to sort me with better energy suppliers than the ones I was currently with. In a nut shell she and the company are going to save me a considerable amount of money.  5 stars from me."
4376|I am very pleased with the service given by utilitywise who have secured some good savings on our bills over next two years. 
4377|The agent phoned our company to offer the services of Utility Wise in our quest to find the cheapest electricity supplier. Having been through these scenarios before I was reluctant to use them. However He was extremely courteous and very helpful when I was unable to understand much of the terminology. I would not hesitate to recommend this company to others.
4378|Utilitywise were extremely helpful in helping us find competitive rates for both our business gas and business electricity supplies. Staff were helpful and always on hand if we needed assistance or information. We would definitely recommend this service to anyone wishing to find competitive rates for their business. 
4379|Have liaised with the agent who was extremely help and knowledgeable and too the pressure off me to look for best deals for our gas and electricity suppliers. We have changed over to Total Power from British Gas and our electricity is due to renew in Jan next year I believe and this is all sorted too so thank you.
4380|As a very busy Facilities Manager working part time hours I really didn't have the time to look at every one of our suppliers of gas and electricity to do price comparisons. Then out of the blue I received a call from Craig Portsmouth who advised he would take all that work away from me and deal with it himself, I would have to do very little and it would cost nothing.  All I had to do was spend about half an hour collating all the relevant details which he needed and ever since I have hardly even had to think about it.  There has been occasions whereby I have needed to query something or ask a question and Craig has always been there for me, if he is not around he gets back to me straight away and has always been able to help me and answer any questions.  I am extremely happy with the service I have received and would be more than happy to recommend (and indeed I have done so) Craig and Utilitywise as a company.  I still get calls from similar firms offering the same service and I always politely say that I am with Utilitywise and am quite happy to stay with them. They have made my life so much easier and for that I am very grateful.
4381|Utility Wise made changing my electricity supplier very easy. Gaurav Wadhawan, the energy consultant who handled my account, was very professional and explained everything clearly which made the whole process vey painless.
4382|Friendly, good service, take the worry out of keeping track of energy prices and changing suppliers.Love the accent of my contact, would love to meet him.
4383|I am very pleased with the very polite/ efficient manner in which the UW member of staff has conducted herself in the many phone calls i have taken with regards to resolving our energy costs in the future.
4384|Found utilitywise to be very helpfull with our energy account. Respected the decision that we made. Would deal with them again. Would also recomend this company to other people.
4385|The service provided by the agent  is exceptional, she not pushy sales person as I hate those companies which are. She was very helpful in finding us the best deal she could on our electricity. These guys are the best company to deal with.
4386|Utilitywise has been like a friend at the end of the phone who has what it takes to give sound advice and assistance in the veritable minefield that is utilities. They take the weight, getting good deals, taking the hassle out of the process, whilst maintaining the levels of service we expect. Kaylea Thomas forged the relationship, Derek Hosie and now Chris Bateman maintain this friendly, helpful approach. I would gladly recommend Utilitywise to anyone I liked, as they will make their life better (well...if dealing with utilities is part of it, anyway!).
4387|my consultant was very helpful, trying his up most best for me. he is always on time with his phone calls. he is just really helpful and polite and so easy to talk to. I don't like the supplier I have got now, as they are not helpful in anyway. My consultant I am talking to now has and is going the extra mile to help me, and not many people these days do that for people. I really wish I could name him as I think that he is brilliant at his job. 
4388|We came across Utilitywise through a recommendation from one of our suppliers. From the start I was impressed with their professionalism and expertise.  They have saved us a small fortune and the change over from suppliers was seamless.They always call back as promised and make you feel that your business is of paramount importance to them.I have recommended them over and over to business contacts as the price people pay for energy these days is often overwhelming and crippling to small businesses. Thank you Utilitywise.
4389|I have always found Utilitywise extremely helpful and knowledgeable, we have used them for a few years now and look forward to having their help in the future.The staff I have dealt with have all been very polite, not pushy or promise things that can not be achieved.I would definitely recommend Utilitywise.
4390|I was contacted by the agent when the office manager was on maternity so found her a god send as I didn't really have the time to compare energy prices. The agent was very professional and friendly. I would highley recommend Utilitywise to both business and personal users.
4391|I have used Utility Wise for about 4 years now and they have always been very helpful in getting the best price for both gas and electricity.
4392|Had a call from the company earlier in the year, very positive, very enthusiastic and had our position nailed. Word must have gotten around because we had a number of calls from others in the organisation as well but it was all in good humour.
4393|The service from Utilitywise, has been very thourough, helpful and friendly.  I would not have any hesitation in recommending their services to others.Many Thanks
4394|A very keen and professional person willing to help achieve the best for his clients.I would have no hesitation in recommending Craig and Utilitywise to look after their electricity and gas contracts.I look forward to continuing my long standing business relationship for the foreseeable future.
4395|Received a proactive contact from the broker, presented prices in an understandable format.  Have used before and will use again.
4396|I found Utilitywise to be extremely knowledgeable, friendly and supportive in all discussions and proposals. They were attentive, without being pushy, and responded within the timescales agreed on all aspects relating to the benchmarking process. I would have no hesitation in recommending them to others, having found my experience to be both enjoyable and educating, I just wish all similar Companies could follow the Utilitywise lead in being clear, concise, along with adding value to the process without ever giving the'hard sell' which is so often encountered during these sort of procedures, which makes it a pleasure and not a chore to deal with them, 
4397|We have several sites and found that keeping track of the various contracts that we had for gas and electricity was a nightmare and was also costly as frequently suppliers rolled contracts forward without our knowledge, tying us into expensive deals.I moved to Utility Wise several years ago to get rid of the stress and to find better more consistent deals.I must congratulate them as they have done everything I wanted and have moved all of our sites to one supplier with the same contact dates, so it's easily monitored and we benefit from the maximum duel fuel discounts.Five stars is just not enough.
4398|Utility companies have become a bit of a nightmare to deal with, switching from one to another seems to be the only way to get a decent rate - this is time consuming, but Utilitywise take this hassle away by obtaining competitive quotes not only from your current supplier but also other suppliers in the marketplace leaving you to simply decide which one you want to choose.We have multiple sites which makes this process all the more confusing if we do it all ourselves, so switching to Utilitywise has been a great help.What's also reassuring to know is that once you have switched, they keep in touch to make sure you are happy with how it is all going.  They were also very quick at resolving any difficulties - caused by our old supplier being a nit niggly about us moving!
4399|The dealings I had in my capacity of Administrator here in the Renfield Centre I have found that Gaurav Wadhawan to be extremely pleasant, polite and helpful with any queries or concerns that my manager had.
4400|Excellent service from the Staff member , Extremely patient and very polite.Very helpful when dealing with my complaint against British Gas and has kept in contact and kept me updated at every given opportunity . I would highly recommend this company to friends and business colleagues
4401|An excellent professional service allways received from the agent .
4402|It has been a pleasure working with Utility wise, honesty and quality of service is very good. They have helped in combining all our sites and finding the best rates. The staff are friendly and honest, they respond to all questions efficiently and quickly, very knowledgeable of the suppliers in the market and they do also compare prices with all suppliers within the market.I wouldnt  hesitate in recommending them to other businesses and will continue to use Utility wise going forward in to the future 
4403|I have used Utilitywise for a number of years now and always found them very helpful. In comparison with other agencies they have found me better offers from energy suppliers, so I would recommend them to anyone. A good service all round.
4404|After being chased and annoyed by a number of utility suppliers we were approached by Utilitywise who offered us a perfect opportunity to reduce our costs. With the help of Relationship Manager Jayne Robson the transition was so easy.  Thanks Jayne and Utilitywise for your help.   
4405|I had the pleasure of dealing with Utility Wise who made it very easy for us to switch our energy supplier in order to guarantee we save money by fixing early rates.  I would have no hesitation to recommend them, especially if you would like an easy no hassle switch.
4406|I usually try to avoid this callers but the agent was very helpful and patient, even when she could not get a hold of me for whatever reason, so we tended to contact each other by e-mail which was very useful. She has taken all the hard work out of changing suppliers and I hope that everything will move on efficiently.
4407|I would recommend Jayne Robson at Utility Wise as she was extremely helpful and very patient when I was making enquiries about suppliers and costs especially as the enquiries were for the community I was representing and costs were very important.  Her suggestions were gratefully accepted and acted upon. At the end of the term I did not have to worry about anything as she was on the ball to remind me of what had to done next.
4408|Really pleased to have been contacted by Utility Wise, we received a refund of nearly GBP300.00 on our business electricity. Really great service. Lawrence was so helpful and did everything for me. Excellent! Thanks you.
4409|Having been approached by various companies about changing our gas/electricity providers, Utiltywise were straightforward, up front and  so helpful. KS was so polite and patient with me - must compliment him on his people-skills! Makes a difference when you feel that someone is actually listening and understanding! Initially felt that there were too many calls - but in hindsight just as well as time was moving so fast we could have been too late to change!Managed to get us a really good deal and changeover was simple! What else do you need!Well done!
4410|I usually try to avoid these sort of calls but glad I did'nt.  Our contact was knowledgable and looked at all gas and electric suppliers available to us to get us the best unit price. Was very shocked at what we were currently paying in comparison to what was available, we obviously moved to new provider with a choice of how long we wanted our contract to be.  This was all done very quickly and we had a new supplier within days.  Great service which we will be using again.  Thank you.
4411|A very helpful service was contacted by the agent who did a Water Bill analysis and an Electric bill analysis. Efficient good service also got us funding for an energy audit to be done one one of the electricity meters. Very clear about what the company offers and answered any questions we may have. Would recommend!
4412|Great service - The agent took care of everything so I didn't have to worry at all, always there on the end of the phone :) It really takes out the work and the worry having someone who understands all the tarifs, etc, and can explain it and get you the best product based on your needs. Thank you!
4413|Following a recent move of offices for my company , I contacted Utilitywise Plc in order find a suitable contract for the electricity supply at our new premises .After a short telephone conversation with an Energy Consultant at Utilitywise Plc , I provided them with details of our previous office electricty supplier (including final meter readings), details of the existing electricity supplier at our new premises and an expectation of my requirements for our new electricity supply contract .A short time later I received a response from Utlitywise Plc who had managed to find me a suitable contract for our electricity supply at our new premises at a cheaper rate than we were currently paying at our old offices .The Energy Consultant at Utilitywise Plc then arranged for all the required paperwork to be forwarded to me for my new contract as well as arranging to deal with our previous electricy supllier from our old offices in respect of our final bill and change of tenancy .The servive that I received from Utilitywise Plc was prompt , polite and efficient and I would have no hesitations in both recommending and using Utilitywise Plc in the future .
4414|Throughout the process I was give full information by the person concerned. Communication was good and the switching of out Gas was done efficiently and smoothly.The switch from a Standing Charge tariff to unit only tariff saved us a lot of Money.I would recommend any business to let Utility Wise look at your Bills and check you are on the right Tariffs.
4415|Handled our company electricity supplier transfer well.
4416|After various cold calls, I eventually listened to what UtilityWise do and how they differ from other utility consultants. The agent and I reviewed the gas and electricity contracts for all 3 of our properties and identified where contracts were ending and therefore there was an opportunity to seek a new and better arrangement. I was particularly pleased that contracts could be arranged more than a month in advance, to take advantage of the best rates. What I've particularly appreciated has been: consistent recommendations, excellent response from the team - always ringing back or e-mailing when or before they said that they would, a range of options tailored to our circumstances, friendly and optimistic staff, a genuine sense that they are seeking my best, not theirs. Once we sorted the easier things, she then took on the task of sorting an issue with Scottish Gas that has been unresolved for over a year. She has been tenacious in pursuing a resolution for this where others, including myself, have given up hope! THANK YOU!
4417|How easy could it be!  Much better than I could believe.  The lovely Bobby Robson sorted out my utility suppliers and saved my company a fortune in 24 hours.  He also sheilded me from a very unhappy man at Opus who wouldnt stop hounding me. Thank you Bobby! Im confident that I will be well looked after.
4418|Utilitywise have helped consolidate all our utility contracts into two bulk contracts helping achieve significant savings across our portfolio. They've also helped us rationalise our invoicing systems too.They are very responsive to our needs as a customer, and always respond quickly to any problems, or queries. We have a single point of contact who is readily available at all times and who is always willing to help.We highly recommend Utilitywise to others in the Housing Sector
4419|We have been with Utilitywise for a about 4 years now and they have always given us great deals on our electricity and gas. They are proactive with searching the best deals and are always willing to go that extra mile to help us out. Their turnaround on emails is fast and no matter what the issue they will help. I highly recommend their service.
4420|Utility wise takes the pain out of switching providers.I have tried to switch previously, but because my address is similar to that of our neighbour, the utility company made a mash up of both accounts and caused me no end of problems. With utilitywise this doesn't happen. They do all the necessary paperwork and everything goes smoothly. The service team are like old friends who seem genuinely interested in what you have to say. 
4421|Good service from Utility Wise.  Move from previous supplier went without a hitch and have not needed to contact them since we transferred over. No news is good news!  I would recommend these people. 
4422|Emerson has been our contact from Utilitywise in connection with the electricity supply for our nursery school. He has been very proactive in finding the best deal for us and reviewing his advice to make sure that we continue to get the best rates available. He is also proactive in that he makes the arduous process of activating any changes as easy as possible by setting things up for us to execute and to make available to us all relevant information that we need to take things forward. His efforts have certainly saved money for the nursery. A big thanks!
4423|"We are a company who have a number of sites and keeping track of the utilities can be quite time consuming.  Since being contacted by Utilitywise this workload has been removed from me.  Our original contact Aysha Ahmed was very friendly, helpful and really seemed to enjoy her work.  Our new Account Manager, Bobby Robson has taken over this with great ease.  He has been very informative and it is a joy to speak with him.  He has made me feel more at ease with the ""fraudulent"" calls I have been receiving and I am very assured that he will do the best he can for the company."
4424|Our company has used Utility Wisesince 2011,I would like to think we will continue to do so for many years to come.  I have always been sceptical with any company who telephones regarding our electricity or gas contracts.The support and advice we receive from Victoria Etherington, is clear and concise.  Nobody has a crystal ball with regards to future price increases, but the information we receive from Utility Wise is as close as it gets to a crystal ball.This area of the business is a minefield,so much money can be lost with a wrong decision taken.  I feel happier that the decisions I make are with Utility Wise recommendations.
4425|Extremely good service and now do not need to think about this anymore.Hopefully when the next renewal comes around this will be dealt with just as efficiently.
4426|The service provided by our agent was outstanding. He made sure that we got the best possible deal on the market and kept us informed throughout the process. If I needed to contact him at all to clarify anything and he wasn't available he would return my call and go through any concerns at length. I look forward to working with him again when our other contract renewals are due.
4427|Utility wise as a whole and especially Jayne Robson made the job of finding the cheapest gas/electic prices a breeze, very helpful and friendly staff and we saved a huge amount. Would highly reccomend.
4428|Utilitywise have been amazing since we started working with them at the beginning of the year. Nothing is too much trouble and they really do go that extra mile to help you out if there is a proble. Having a main point of contact who provides fanatstic and efficient service helps to ensure that you always get the best possible price and also that there is a seamless transition between transfering providers.I would recommend Utilitywise to others as they are customer focused, always get competitive prices and they listen to what you need.
4429|As usual, great service from Utilitywise.  Lewis McKie was really helpful in finding us a great rate and presenting it to me in a clear and concise way.  We saved around GBP1k on our bill.  Lewis was always on hand for advice and everything was just easier with him on board.Will definitely be using Utilitywise going forward.
4430|My point of contact was very professional and friendly and made the changeover of my supplier for gas very easy with little paperwork involved.  I would have no problem recommending Utilitywise to my friends and family. 
4431|A surprisingly good service, considering the market they are up against.  I received an excellent level of customer care from Ricky Gosling when we were about to change our supplier.  He managed to obtain a much better deal than British gas were offering. Much appreciated.
4432|Easy to deal with, excellent communication and very helpful
4433|I have found Utlitywise to be very helpful in sourcing the best available utility rates. This has saved me a lot of time and even then I would not have had the access that utilitywise has to different suppliers rates.
4434| Ricky Gosling is our account manager and with many contracts to juggle his assistance in keeping up to date with renewal dates and utility prices is invaluable. He quickly responds to any queries we may have and has solved many issues on our behalf in an efficient and courteous manner.
4435|Utility Wise handled everything for me it couldn't have been simpler and found a supplier with a fantastic rate and service as well.  I would have no hesitation in recommending them to friends and collegues
4436|I joined utility wise last year,i found them to be very helpful throughtout.
4437|We went to Utilitywise as we didn't have any contact with our supplier and in the cuurent climate needed to save money on our bills. We feel that having a one-to-one operative dealing with our accounts is beneficial to us and will save us money in the long term. Our dealings with our representative have been most satisfactory in every way, and we have recommended utilitywise to associates of ours.  
4438|The service has been good, nice to have a contact point when anything needs checked. Happy with contracts secured.
4439|The service I received was excellent, I was called very regularly (maybe a bit too much) with updates and made huge savings. The member of staff I dealt with was very informative about costs and understanding to my situation. I would and HAVE recommended this service to friends. 
4440|Efficient and effective cost saving service.  Our accounts were dealt with professionally and efficiently.  
4441|Utilitywise found our organisation a very competitive price for our electricity supply. We had previous been out-of-contract with a different supplier and were being charged a fortune.The deal Utilitywise found us was so good we've actually extended with that supplier up until 2017.
4442|The key thing i found was that the service this staff member provided was both helpful & honest. He made sure that i was informed of all the various aspects of the service Utilitywise had on offer & nothing was too much. He made sure to keep me updated on the process. It can be confusing at times & various different brokers are vying for your time so when someone takes care in understanding your needs then it makes the process easier to handle.
4443|It is one of the few things not needed to be thought about when our utility contracts are due for renewal as Utilitywise contact us within good time and with various options to enable us to find the best deal around at the time. They are not pushy but are friendly and helpful.
4444|We were contacted by Utility Wise several years ago about our energy needs and they found us a very good deal.Since then they have been pro-active in carrying out reviews and keeping us upto date with changes in the market and making recommendations.I still occasionaly go out into the market to make own assessment but this has only supported the information given to me by Utility WisePinnacle Office Equipment
4445|As a company, we dont know the vagaries associated with the energy markets. To overcome that problem weve used Utilitywise to act on our behalf. In all the time weve been with them, circa five years, they have obtained what we perceive to be competitive prices and lengths of contact which has allowed us to focus on what we know. Our contact at Utilitywise has managed our contract in a proactive manner. He offers advice which appears to be valid and reliable and places our interests first. We have to trust the advice Utilitywise offer otherwise the process will not work. To that end the relationship with the Energy Consultant is of utmost importance. Without mutual trust we would need to deal with the energy suppliers directly and given the fluctuations in energy markets the time we would have to devote to that process would detract from our core business.   
4446|In 2 years of dealing with Utilitywise I find :- Perfectly strait forward Prompt in dealing with queries Arranging and putting in place new contracts, renewals etc. All in all, very well satisfied particularly with the person I deal with. I am Vice Chairman of a Chidren's Charity, every penny counts and I know the staff at Utilitywise have this in mind In all our dealings. A very well done. 
4447|I dealt with utilitywise with regards all I my sites. Very professional service and friendly salesperson.Have saved me money which is the most important thing in all business
4448|We have 4 sites and they have come up with the best prices I have ever had for power
4449|I have dealt with Utilitywise for several years now. He has always strived to get the best prices for us (gas and electricity). His knowledge of the energy industry is a credit to your company. He lets the rates speak for themselves, they are always competitive. I would have no doubt in recommending him and Utilitywise to anyone seeking help with their energy negotiations. All in all, I have not got a bad word to say against him or Utilitywise.
4450|I must say, that in the past I have been wary of companies trying to offer best deals for utility companies. Since using Utilitywise, I have changed my mind, their adviser has been most helpful in sorting out my utility companies and helped save the company money! Well done!
4451|I used this company for electric and gas for a few years and the deal at the beginning was good. I trusted them which was a mistake as the next contracts were not competitive. I am now with British Gas for both E&G; at a much better deal. 
4452|I used utilititywise to get a quote as I was being continually hassled by the company. I finally gave in and thought I would give it a go! Surprise surprise as expected this is a complete waste of time. I made one phone call direct to a supplier and blew their prices out of the water! Do not use this company they try and pressurise you into signing contracts which are a lot more expensive than going direct to suppliers
4453|Inundated with telephone calls from this company. They pestered me for months despite me requesting they take us off their system. High pressure sales tactics used. I would never do business with them  
4454|Company is very poor, apart from doubling my gas bill with scaremongering, pestering me for over a month on the phone, I have asked three times for there complaints procedure, still not got it. I have also asked them for the comparable's they used to see how they got to the figure they signed me up for. FOR EVERYONES REFERENCE THEY ARE NOT CONSULTANTS, THEY DO NOT GET YOU THE BEST DEAL, THEY HAVE ACTUALLY DOUBLED MY GAS?if you need to use a comparison site try utilitybidder, much more professional and smaller prices.  
4455|After reading a few reviews I was quite reluctant to use utilitywise, however they checked all my bills free of charge and found I'd been on the wrong climate change levy and VAT rates. They got this refunded to me and provided me with my renewal quotes from my supplier. Being happy with their services I used them to get some prices, as their service is free I thought why not compare their prices against ones I received myself, and they were a lot cheaper, they also managed to abolish my daily standing charge which I was told by many suppliers was mandatory. Utilitywise provided a good service to me and would recommend to anyone. Just use your head, if your renewing your gas or electric and they come back with good prices then great, if they sound high, simply say no and look elsewhere. The good thing about them is no longer having to wait in massive call ques when wanting to get through to British gas, they do it all for me.  
4456|Just had these muppets leave me a vmail....and they want me to call back!!! for what , to rip me off, most of the reviews on here for this company are fake...I have this on good authority...avoid if you do not want to be ripped off
4457|Dealt with utilitywise the lady i spoke to was rude,pushy told me if i didnt sign that day (even as my contract didnt expiry for another 5 months)when i said no she was rude and said i wouldnt get any body else to quote for my electricty contract,i am a business and use GBP62000 of electricty a year. found lots of companies who would take on my contract and at better rates surprise surprise!! wouldnt deal with them if they were the last broker on this earth
4458|These other reviews are obviously written by the staff of utilitywise. There a bunch of ignorant **** who would rip you off in a heartbeat. Dont expect a reply from them unless they have a sniff of money from you..
4459|The advisor from Utilitywise not only helped us to secure a fixed price contract at a great rate but also somehow managed to do this 6 months before all the other brokers got in touch.  With prices going up so often at the moment it meant we got in there before another major price rise. On top of getting a good deal she also helped us to claim back over GBP1000 in over paid VAT as we are a charity.  She was really friendly and helpful and made the switch nice and simple.
4460|"When I was first approached by Utilitywise I thought ""Oh no not again"", another energy company wasting my time, but after talking to the advisor, who is lovely, I realised they were different.  She was very professional and explained everything in detail and kept me informed at every stage of the proceedings.  When you're trying to run a small business there are things that you need to do but haven't always got the time, at least using Utilitywise they take that job off you to free you up to do something else.I would definitely recommend them."
4461|I was contacted by Utilitywise with regards to checking our gas and electricity meters and making sure we were on the best possible tarrif.  I was a bit nervous at first, surely there must be a catch somewhere as nothing is free, however when Mark explained how it worked, my mind was put at ease. They looked after us on the pricing side and was great.  He's sorted out our contracts for both gas and electricity on two sites and saved us money. I can get on with my day to day job, knowing that the experts at Utilitywise are looking after our needs.
4462|We were approached by Utility Wise and although we often have approaches from companies offering to save us money they seemed genuinely interested in helping us.They dealt with us efficiently, kept us on the case in a supportive way and then found us real energy savings. As a bonus they also found we'd paid too much VAT and claimed it back for us.Well done and a special thanks to Marie!
4463|I was approached by Utilitywise a couple of years ago with a view to sourcing a better rate for our electricity and gas.  Their  representative Gareth Jones could not have been more helpful. Not only did he source us very competitive rates but he made the transition from one supplier to another go very smoothly.  I would certainly recommend Utilitywise to other business colleagues as the service they provide is second to none.
4464|We have a half hourly meter on our site which was with a company who uses red,amber and green ratings along with numerous other add ons which make changing our supplier very difficult.Mark Scott at Utility wise took the time to consult with a colleague as he was not au fait with the way this company rated the consumption. Mark then took ownership of the case and found me a supplier that could supply us at a competitive rate and also supplied a user friendly billing system. Our bills average at GBP2500 per month and I told Mark my concerns at not knowing what we were paying for and I am very impressed that he took this into consideration when placing us with the new company.I would not hesitate to recommend Utilitywise as broker and this is all to do with the helpful Mark Scott.
4465|"They were able to help our companies at a time when we were moving premises and going through a massive re-organisation.They showed a ""can do"" attitude which made them an indispensable part of our beleaguered admin team.I cannot recommend their tenacity and ability to solve problems in a way which defines the term ""thinking outside the box"".I was  ambivalent about the need for an energy broker,but Utilitywise came up with the price,the product, and ,most importantly, the service. Utilitywise was there every step of the way. Many thanks again,gentlemen.   "
4466|The advisor from Utilitywise has been extremely helpfull in getting the best rates available for gas & electricity for our company.
4467|With three community centres to look after gas and electric costs are of a priority and as a charity we are not keen on entering lengthy contracts.  Utilitywise arranged all of our centre contracts at low prices for only one year.Gareth Jones is a total asset to this company, always cheerful and helpful.  He went out of his way for us and always kept us up to date with everything going on.  I would recommend Gareth and this company to anyone.
4468|I dealt with a contact who was very professional. It was great having ONE contact who knew my business needs and was very helpful and knowledgable. He always contacted me when he said he would and answered any queries I had on the contract etc. I would have no problem dealing with them again.
4469|They took all the pain out of switching from our current suppliers to a new contract. The advisor could not have been more helpful keeping us up to speed with everything that was going on every step of the way. Would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to sort out their business energy suppliers. Just sit back and let them take all the strain.  
4470|We are a small company and have been having many issues with one of the main energy suppliers, costing us greatly in time and money that we can not afford. We then started working with Gareth Jones who has been a fantastic help in us resolving these issues. Gareth has been friendly, informative and helped make a very difficult time stress free. He has kept us up to date at all times, whilst being very patient with our indecisiveness and concerns. The service we have received has been of a very high standard indeed, thank you Gareth for your hard work and dedication to helping resolve our problems.   
4471|The advisor of Utility Wise contacted me to offer their services and reduce our energy costs. Ian did all the leg work and provided me with the most cost effective deals to choose from. The whole process took very little of my time and saved me money. The service offered by Utilitywise is free and offered me the opportunity to find the best deals in the market which I wouldn't have had time to do myself.
4472| Gareth Jones at Utilitywise is a star - helpful, responsive and  informative. He helped this charity  get a good deal on energy. As a busy charity working with people with learning disabilities, we need to concentrate on our clients - not our energy supplier. Gareth takes this load off us and assures us that we get a great deal while dealing directly with the company.Great work!
4473|I was contacted by Utilitywise sometime ago.. I was interestedin the service provided as I work in a small Bathroom and Kitchen studio which had at the time many suppliers of utilitys due to the position of the meters and the conversion from a flat to partof the showroom and details of contracts etc was unknown.It was a daunting task to say the least!The advisor worked with me entirely to ensure smooth transitions etc and to date everything is still running smoothly.Keep up the good work :-)
4474|Intially being tied to a contract that was not what we had first thought, I started dealing with a new manager who understood past performance concerns and was honest and open and provided market trends and understood our needs.Will continue to work with them as long as they continue to give competitive rates and a transparent approach.
4475|We are land agents and factors for quite a few different estates and I have now used Utilitywise quite a few times to arrange new electricity contracts for our clients.  They make the job to switch suppliers very easy taking all leg work away from me, which is great. I have used the same consultant each time and she has been very helpful and will continue to use her services in the future. 
4476|Paul Morrison of Utilitywise called me out of the blue to determine whether we would consider allowing them to price for our energy contract.  As I had not heard of them before I was sceptical, but our contract was up for renewal, and I agreed.Paul provided a super service.  He had a very pleasant manner,he was readily available and ensured that attention was paid to all details relative to changing to our supplier.The transition period was smooth with no problems whatsoever.I would certainly recommend Utilitywise to any prospective customers, both on customer service and securing financial savings for your business.
4477|Utility wise tied us in to a 5 year contract for our gas on extortionate prices. We cannot leave and has affected the business to the brink of ruin. Do not go near this company.
4478|i dealt with an account manager who was fairly new to the job. as i was newly appointed as director i decided to give the guy a chance to take some work load from me. explained the service and we would need to return the LOA and he would come back with prices, he came back with our renewal rate from EDF and then had 3 other prices from British Gas, SSE, and TGP. he had the yearly price laid out in a spreadsheet, it seemed ok, so i went onto uswitch, who by the way work EXACTLY the same way, we know these companies put uplift on, even uswitch do this, as i came back from uswitch with a cheaper rate, and the guy levelled with me, that it would be hard to beat, however, he did, and took a hit on his commision to undercut what uswitch offered me, and saved me GBP590 over the year against the cheapest deal uswitch offered. we all know companies make money, but it really saves the hassle going direct, no matter what anybody says, and i will trust the guy next time to get me a better deal. honesty prevailed and not everybody is like that however he has won a customer for life because of it. i would recommend this service to anyone
4479|I recieved a call from a very polite and friendly lady who advised they could help reduce our gas and electricity bills. She asked me to send over a copy of our bills and asked questions about how our business operates, when we use our energy, what for etc. After sending over my bills i recieved another call from them the next day with two tariff options available to me, one of them was with my current supplier and one from another supplier. As there wasn't much of a difference i opted to stay with my current supplier however the rates were nearly half what i was paying. I needed to sign a form and send it back to them and Utilitywise took care of everything it really could not have been easier.They also arranged for a meter to be installed which meant we did not have to read the meter anymore as i mentioned it was difficult for us to get to the meter and provide meter readings.I would have no qualms in using their services again and to reccomend to others.
4480|Utilitywise switched our charity to a supplier which charges substantially more than we have been paying; a deal which we are locked into for a year. Our 'consultant' would not respond to any phone messages or emails requesting clarification on the rates to which we were being switched over. When it was too late to countermand the change, he finally managed the brief message 'no, you really are better off with {new supplier}'. I believe the basic ability to compare two numbers and verify which is the smaller ought to be a fundamental prerequisite for an energy broker. Utilitywise do not seem to regard this as an essential skill. They get one star only because I can't award zero. Since I complained to them, they have spent more time and effort attempting to remove my review than they have addressing my complaint.
4481|We are a community arts charity based in Leeds who run our own large building with educational and therapeutic workspaces and offices. Utilitywise approached us offering to review our electricity and gas services at a time when we were in the process of moving into temporary accommodation due to building works being undertaken on our permanent building. This was an extremely busy and stressful time for us, and our energy consultant at Utilitywise could not have been more helpful and understanding. We were by no means straightforward clients as we were moving between two premises, and on a tight budget. Utilitywise managed to save us nearly 50% on our utility bills, as well as organising the utility services for our permanent and temporary premises. Our account manager was very friendly and efficient, and kept us up to date on progress with our accounts. The transition between suppliers was smooth and most of the paperwork was dealt with for us, leaving us to concentrate on running our organisation and packing boxes! We have already recommended Utilitywise to other sister organisations in Leeds, and would not hesitate in recommending them to anyone
4482|I would highly recommend Utilitywise. Their professional, helpful and well informed staff have not only negotiated some very good deals on electricity and gas prices they have saved me a lot of time and effort that I would otherwise have spent shopping around for the best prices from the various suppliers  myself. I have every confidence in them.Vic Hayward
4483|Where to start? I got a cold call and was about to tell them where to go.   They explained all the different things they could do for me to help me save money.   Had a good look on their website and they seemed pretty decent.   They sorted me out with a rate I couldn't get cheaper anywhere and I did a LOT of searching.   They also take care of everything, if I have the slightest question about my bills I have a direct number for a lovely lady who always answers my questions quickly.   As a small business I take customer service and price very seriously so they have been a breath of fresh air!   I would recommend their services to everyone who runs a business.
4484|We chose UtilityWise for both our gas and electric and we're really pleased with them. They found the cheapest rates available to us and managed the whole transfer process without any problems.They have a wide range of suppliers which gave us confidence that they'd look everywhere possible to ensure we had the best price and an account manager dealt with everything for us.We would certainly recommend! Thanks
4485|The problems actually all started when I decided to switch to a cheaper supplier. I owed some money on the account, which was initially due to be taken out in one lump sum, I cancelled the DD, messaged them and said I would be splitting it over 2 payments. After I sent the first GBP50 I received an email stating a monthly DD would be set up to take out GBP112, I cancelled this, messaged them about this (but they take an age to respond). Received the same email again, so called to have this stopped, was told I would no longer receive any more automatic DD setups. Soon after this, they took GBP112 out of my account, had to call up again, of course was told that absolutely this time it would not happen again. The DD was returned as I did not owe them this amount of money. Not too long after this I received the same email, another DD set up, this time for GBP87, not the amount actually due , this is the amount they would charge monthly during spring/summer. Called up yet again, they also have very inconvenient call centre opening times mon-fri 9-5, not helpful if those are your working hours. The person I spoke to told me that the DD were still being automatically set up as I had an outstanding balance of GBP50, even though the last time I called the person I spoke to acknowledged that payment. When they're trying to reclaim money owed via DD they don't actually try to claim the exact amount, they just continue with the monthly bills set up. So I would have overpaid by a significant amount had I just allowed the DD to continue. Total joke. Avoid at all costs, when you leave it will be a nightmare to get rid of them.
4486|Hello All, CAUTION - You might be deceived by the slightly less charge, but get trapped. You will have horrible experience. Its a word of caution from a customer who had horrible experience with iSupply. I switched to iSupplyEnergy last June. Since I had to leave the country, I requested for the termination of contract and settling the dues. I was asked by the Customer care not to cancel my direct debit till the termination is completed. From December till date, I have called up the call center at least 60 times to sort out the bill and pay me GBP180, which was paid in excess. It hasnt resulted in anything except checking my patience. Everytime, I hear stupid, annoying reasons. Below are the reasons given 1. Final meter reading is not available - I told that I had already provided it when leaving the property 2. Final meter reading has to be confirmed by my letting agent - I called up my letting agent and they told they are happy to provide these if asked by iSupply 3 - The final reading has to be agreed with the new supplier - This is ridiculous, its not my mistake 4 - Now if I call up customer care, they tell that they have to confirm with their colleague and dont get back to me for 30-45 mins. I am now planning to go with the legal procedure against iSupplyEnergy. 
4487|everything is fine until you switch to another supplier and then they will not refund what you are owed! I'm owed almost sixty pounds from them and am looking at a wait of 65 days until they refund me, if they refund me at all! When I complained that I want MY money they say they are working within their timelines, the timeline they gave me was 28 days after end of contract, not 65! TERRIBLE customer service! 
4488|Been with them for a couple of years now, no problems.Had solar panels fitted and their hand holding through the FIT's process was invaluable.Stick to e.mail contact and be pleasantly surprised.
4489|Been with them for a couple of years now, no problems.Had solar panels fitted and their hand holding through the FIT's process was invaluable.Stick to e.mail contact and be pleasantly surprised.
4490|A company that works fine whilst online.... BUT when things go wrong..... NIGHTMARE.... the company cannot cope with anything manually. Poor message system and poor complaints proceedure Poor customer relations and very unsympathetic towards client. However the price is very good. Its a case of if all goes well no problem but if things go wrong jump of the end of your nearest pier.
4491|I'm quite surprised to see so many negative comments as my experience with isupply has been really good so far. It may take a bit longer to get through on the phone than some of the bigger energy companies, but that doesn't really bother me considering the huge saving that I am making! The website is user friendly and its easy to give meter readings. My direct debit is slightly higher than what I am using but they have said I am able to change this whenever I want to although I haven't tried to do this yet. Overall I'm pleased with the service I have received so far but the main thing for me is cost and isupply were far cheaper than any other supplier in my area.
4492|i-Supply are quick to take your money, they take as much as they can and they will set the DD at an amount well over what you normally be expected to use. A substantial amount of your money builds up in their favour; what they use it for can only be speculated on, presumably they invest it and rake off the interest.They do not answer phones, they may take weeks to answer emails and then the answers are non-committal and they most definitely will not refund your overpayment, only reducing the DD by a few pounds if you complain.Fed up with being treated like a cash cow I left i-supply several weeks ago when my account was several hundred pounds in credit. After the move was completed I expected i-supply to refund my overpayment. Yeah, right. I am still waiting.I hope this is a warning to anyone thinking of changing, read the reviews on this and other sites. I wish I had.
4493|Every time you contact them they take an age to respond. Give wrong information useless.
4494|Im sure all the other people who had a nightmare with this company are as angry as me. Im angry i even had to award this company one star! The should create minus stars for companies like this. Its a complete shambles safe yourself the stress and go somewhere else. The customer service is beyond belief. they dont like to give your your money back when you leave. You have been warned.
4495|Isupply energy are officially the worst energy company in the UK . Customer service is appalling and treat leaving customers in the worst possible, and refuse to refund money they owe m having to take them to court to recover an overpayment.Do not go near them with a Bargepole
4496|Been with Isupplyenergy for a year!! No problems until you want to leave! Little or no response to emails when I tried to start to close my account...... 6 weeks earlier. Yeah I realise I couldn't give my final meter reading but unhelpful is not the word when I finally got through on the phone!!!!Really unhelpful when I did call up. Overall I really wouldn't bother, better companies that offer better things. Won't be using again! 
4497|Truly the worst company I have ever dealt with .  As others have indicated they charge to high on the monthly tariff then drag their feet when it comes to providing a refund.  Contacting them is a nightmare, on average it takes them about two weeks to reply via email.  Can't wait for my contract to end - never again.
4498|This company would have been fine if they had not consistently taken more money from my bank account than I was spending on electricity.  Despite constantly telling them that the amount that they were taking was too high, they dragged their feet on reducing the amount and then only reduced it fractionally.  By the time I switched supplier a year later, I was about GBP150 in credit when I was only using about GBP10 of electricity per month.  For good measure, they took another GBP21 out the month AFTER I switched supplier, so I quickly closed the Direct Debit.  Their customer service is very slow and unsatisfactory, even for a small company.  Operating on tight margins is one thing, but so am I!!  I would not recommend this firm.
4499|we joined isupply as we took over the account from previous tenants. The first two months they sent me letters saying my bill was overdue when they haven't even sent me a bill! They then hugely overestimated the bill when they finally did do it, and have so far taken 3 months to calculate the correct figure.I have just logged on to check if the bill is there yet or not and found they have changed all my details back to the previous tenants!If you try to phone, you will spend ages waiting to get through.Do not use this company!! 
4500|I wanted to support a local company and the tariff seemed good so I switched to isupply energy. t has been a truly awful experience. As others have said the customer service is terrible. My metre stopped working and it took dozens of emails, phone calls etc and 5 months for them to respond and then they charged me for the metre and estimated a ridiculous amount of electricity usage that they now expect me to pay above the correct amount that I was paying each month. It is almost impossible to get through on the phone but I don't object to needing to use online communication in return for a lower tariff. However, their online system has failed several times over the past few months. They claim they cannot read messages from me and their online system is very clumsy. They promised compensation for the appalling customer service but have never paid and deny it even though it is clearly written in an email from them. I have no idea how to get them to sort my account out. I have left them and closed my direct debit but they are still claiming I owe money. If anyone has any suggestions they would be gratefully received but please don't be tempted to switch to them!
4501|I've been with isupply for a year now, as they were the cheapest at the time.  Since joining them though my experience has been terrible:1/ I like my direct debits to come out early in the month, but isupply set it up on their terms when you join. I tried getting customer service to change it and was told it's tough!   This was noticed after the cooling off period, because they hardly contact you until you're in contract.2/ It takes ages to get through to customer service, when I always felt fobbed off by people who didn't really want to help.3/ I moved suppliers in November 14 with GBP100+ credit in my isupply account, following multiple service requests and phone calls, it's now February 15 and I still haven't got MY money back.The fact they were slightly cheaper has been far outweighed by their incompetence in my opinion.
4502|Really quite sad company. Excellent idea to provide a cheap tariff. Just no processes, no IT department, no customers services, no plan, no structure, just not sustainable as a business proposition. Where is the leadership and management of this business?
4503|The online system takes weeks to process anything. Messages are ignored and eventually poorly answered. You can't reply to messages, only send a new one each time. Bills are willfully overestimated, even with regular readings provided; corrected bills with actual readings are not generated for weeks after transfer to another company. If you are transferring out, cancel your direct debit early so you don't run up a credit: if you do, it is very difficult to get back. Went to this service because it was cheap, however I cannot deal with a company whose online system is this bad and this slow to react. They only draw up bills every three months, even if you provide updated meter readings, and if you refuse to pay in the interim because they have charged for electricity you have not used, send threatening letters for 3 months until the next bill cycle. Have gone back to Scottish Power. It was that bad. The deal with Scottish Power was actually cheaper than the contract renewal being offered by isupply.
4504|What a joke. Just realised they been taking 120 per month out of my account and they have not taken over supply. Lots of calls and emails on their website ...nothing.Mistakes happen, I accept that, and indeed this gives companies the opportunity to shine and stand out by the way og great service.Isupply are dreadful.They have 600 of my money which i cant recover (yet)...and this was supposed to save me money. And the Government wonder why people dont change!!!!!
4505|This company has very poor standards of customer service.  I have been given contradictory and inaccurate information.  I would not recommend them.
4506|been with isupply for 3 years now and renewed twice.  prices have reduced on latest renewal.  Had a problem with my meter last year which was sorted quickly and was contacted by email and through my online account so know when someone was coming out. knew it was an online account when I switched and paying by dd so very happy and always got my bills on time.  don't understand some of the other comments on here.  
4507|I joined their contract beginning of Jan 2014 as found them the cheapest. It took me nearly 2 months to have my credit back. The contract now ended  and I found somewhere else cheaper and better customer review. I just hoped that it won't take another 2 months to get my money back.Have to wait for nearly 3 to 4 months later to view my first on line statement. The last one I had was September and still waiting for the December one. They only provide statement once every 3 months.To send them message was a joke at the beginning and they come back to say they are improving. I am still unable to view my messages that I sent them in December though I have a reply from them. Their website needs a lot of improving. Not sure if I wanted to talk to them, best to avoid as it might take you ages to speak to someone. Best website service I had was Scottish Power however their quote is not competitive.
4508|Changed to isupplyenergy last year for electricity supply - do  not have gas - and am considering renewing contract. Their renewal price is slightly higher than FirstUtility, who have a poor customer service record. The service from isupplyenergy has been good but perhaps not really tested as there have been no issues about bills, communications or payments. Web site is easy to use and provides good information on usage etc etc. Tariff seems very competitive but noticed that it is not shown on some comparison web sites. No hesitation from my experience to recommend them as a supplier and will probably renew this year.
4509|Too many times I have been contacting this company to refund my overpayments, which are over GBP200 and still they keep taking direct debits, even took 2 payments this month.After sending in a meter reading and waiting for a month, they replied saying I needed to send another meter reading? I have been told several times that a refund will be sent and the months keep ticking by. Scandalous disregard for customers.No wonder they have a GBP30 cancellation fee on accounts.Once this period is finished I will not use this company again. Said the same with British Gas and Npower, they are all the same!    
4510|This company have no idea what they are doing, they do not know how to calculate bills!  I have switched suppliers but they will not let me pay off my final bill.  Only operate from 9-5 so difficult to get hold of them when you work.  When you do manage to get through to someone they put you on hold for ages.  If you ask to speak to a manager you are fobbed off.  Not a good company.       
4511|i switched in dec 2013 and have just renewed for another year.never had any problems with contacting them,or with my direct debits..yes they take money up front,yes the direct debit will go up during the winter months,but so will my electricity useage,so dont know why so many people are suprised by this!..if you switched from 1 off the big 6 suppliers with GBP100,s of pounds in credit,surely you were paying to much in the first place?.i was with n power the scottish power until i found i supply energy,who  are a lot cheaper per unit,and ive no hassle at all..as long as ive power,ive no need to contact them anyway surely?...
4512|These guys are very disorganised and unprofessional. Avoid them.
4513|The quote was good. I spent time setting up the account. The quote was equivalent to GBP18 per month. They wanted to set it up for GBP24 per month. More than my current supplier. WHAT SAVING?As others have said it is useless trying to get through on the phone.Give a wide berth.Bad experience.
4514|Ever since the energy supply business was deregulated I've always taken the opportunity to switch gas and electricity suppliers when a better deal comes up. So I've experienced a number of suppliers in that time and feel qualified to make an objective comparison. I switched to isupply energy for electricity when they were new and offering the best deal. It's been a lesson for me that sometimes it's not always the best thing to choose purely on price. Their customer service has been dreadful throughout. It's almost impossible to get through to them on the phone, they've ignored 30% of messages sent through my account portal, and the fastest response they've given on the others is three days.To cap it all when I decided to switch from them they made a spurious objection to halt the process (my account was well in credit, I hadn't cancelled my direct debit). By the time they stopped delaying the switch process I'd lost the good deal I'd found. Now having finally switched I'm struggling to get my credit balance refunded.My advice is to avoid them. Fortunately they are no longer the cheapest deal which may save many people a frustrating experience. 
4515|It is absolutely impossible to communicate with this company. They do not answer their phone and have ignored 3 online messages. I have a credit balance of over GBP180 for the past year and no way of recovering it it seems.
4516|The Customer Service needs vast improvement. Had to close the account 2 and a half months ago as I needed a dual fuel supplier and am owed GBP265 credit. Have used their messaging service several times and phoned them 3 times and all I have had is false promises and evasive answers. They respond very slowly, if at all. My advice would be don't go with iSupply until they improve their Customer Service.
4517|What an utter shambles. No contact after online sign up, all went very quiet and I'd actually thought there was never going to be a change over, checked online to find a message about cooling off and that was it. Checked agin to find I had an account. I heard nothing about meter readings so thought perhaps somebody had been around to read the meter, but nothing. Checked my previous supplier after receiving a bill to find they had heard nothing either so clearly decided to invent an overestimated meter reading to deal with closing my account. This means that 2 months on I am paying isuplly for electricty yet my meter readings are lower than the readings used by the previous supplier! I sent in new meter readings to isupply, but they are still collecting money for electricity!! Isupply terms and conditons state that they will make contact within 5 days of opening the account, but they didnt. Now, try and message and wait a week for a useless reply, phone and find you are at the end of a long queue. I have suggested they adjust their readings and only charge me for electricity from my last suppliers overestimate buy they suggest I go into dispute with them, despite the fact that its them who are the problem. I'll give it another month then will make a formal complaint.
4518|Firstly, they wanted a payment up front, I refused and said forget it and they said ok, we will waive itSecondly, when, after a year, I tried to switch from them to a n other supplier they blocked it and I had to go to the regulator to get the block liftedLastly, I paid monthly by direct debit and two months after I had left them they sent me an email threatening court actio saying I owed them moneyI tried and tried to contact them to no avail Absolutely the very worst supplier there is, take my advice and do not go anywhere near them
4519|Difficult to understand some of the reviews posted. Yes it does take a while sometimes to get through on the phone but you always know where you are in the queue. You can post your own readings every 5 days if you want so why are some people going on about estimated bills? We have found their customer service department polite and at least understandable. Energy is very competitive, surely that is the main criteria?Regarding repayments etc, we waited months for ours from one of the big (?) 6Lights come on, dinner cooks....Parfait.
4520|If they can get things wrong they will get them wrong and when you try to contact them they don't seem to answer phone or reply to emails/messages.AVOID AVOID AVOID
4521|Switched to isupplyenergy in July 2013. Energy received from 1 September 2013. Instantly saved money.Now using more units on economy 7 and the new contract from 1 September 2014 is reduced on night units, slight increase on day units. So I will save more!Emails via the website are answered efficiently.No complaints. Would recommend IF you have economy 7.It's also a very easy website to use especially the meter reading part.
4522|I had a very happy 18months as a customer...then I changed my bank account.take my advice  DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE YOUR DIRCT DEBIT DETAILS with this company. I have spent 4 months trying to sort out their mistake with my new direct debit details. emails get no response for weeks.EVENTUALLY ...after a dozen emails..THEY SUGGESTED I PAY BY STANDING ORDER.today I had an email from THE CREDIT CONTROL TEAM telling me MY DIRECT DEBIT had failed...I telephoned customer services. They arranged for a call back at2pm....it is now 5pm.and their phone lines are closed!!!!!!I WILL ESCAPE IN DECEMBER WHEN MY CONTRACT ENDS.....I HOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4523|I have been trying to change my supply from isupply to extra energy, keep telling me they have not heard from extraenergy. Then they wanted to fine me GBP10 for cancelling my direct debit to them, I am GBP200 in credit. Today they have tried to restore the direct debit I have cancelled, the one they were trying to sting me GBP10 for. E mail responses are a joke sometimes over 2 weeks before you get an answer. Keep well away as this firm is a joke.
4524|Switched to isupply in March, fast problem free switch and am now enjoying cheaper electricity than being with the big six, I have not had to contact customer service as so far I have had no problem with them at all. Glad I broke away from the greedy big six and gave this new supplier a chance, as long as they remain this competitive will be happy to stay with them.
4525|iSupply take payments well ahead of supply and overestimate demand to justify increasing the DD  they take each month. After a year of overpayment we switched back to one of the Big 6.  Two months later we are still awaiting the repayment of hundreds of pounds overpayment. Is iSupply solvent?
4526|I have read some of the reviews and they are unlike the experience I have.  I have spoken to them on the telephone they returned my calls and have always been extremely helpful, in fact I would say they have gone the extra mile.This is my second year with the company and would not hesitate to renew when my contract ends, especially if they are coming out cheaper, but I would consider even if they were a little more as they have been so good.So much better than my last company who tried to take an extra GBP30 although my contract with them had ended.
4527|Switched from Big 6 nearly one year ago to get cheaper monthly rate on electricity. Yes slow with on line statements but getting better and just been offered fixed tariff renewal for next year at very good rate with time to check it out. Beats all other companies on Switching sites. I have had cheaper electricity for year and getting used to no regular paper statements but so what! My electricity has been there every day when I press a switch and cheap so staying with them for another year at least! They are trying hard to improve. Cannot comment on contacting their customer service as I have not needed it.

4529|Once you have been with this company for a while and realise that they are never going to respond as a larger company will, and as a result can create economies, you can bury your frustration, rest in peace and view the savings you are making.If you want efficiency and service go with one of the big guys - and pay for it!!
4530|I change suppler 29 march. I supply Engery  took a DD on 1 April and  1 May. Did not receive my final statement until the 1 May once I rang up.  They take weeks to respond to emails. There customer service is an alien word for them 
4531|Worst ever customer service. Could never talk to anybody.Emails were ignored endless problems. Stay well away
4532|Unwilling to resolve issues with my direct debit.Unwilling to refund the credit I had.Unwilling to refund my outstanding balance when I leftI would give them a zero but can't
4533|I switched to iSupplyEnergy from British Gas (standard tariff) and am now saving GBP10 per month. I was able to carry out the transfer on-line and it took place quickly and without a problem. There's nothing else for me to add -- I flip a switch and there is electricity, except that it costs less!
4534|Changing suppliers is a nightmare, no doubt about it.  But, keep a note of every meter reading (I did this weekly, record every conversation, use a belt and braces approach with old and new supplier and hey presto ... 4 months after I initiated the changeover process I'm paying considerably less than I did with British Gas (named and shamed!) and am very  happy with the service.  Everything is done online so isupplyenergy aren't too geared up for phone calls.  But email and they ring back within a few hours and are charming and knowledgable.  At least, that's my experience.After I decided to change I heard nothing for some time and when I read the appalling reviews I thought 'what have I done?'  But patience and perseverance paid off.  I've just had my first online statement which is clear and easy to understand; my initial monthly direct debit has been reduced as promised and I'm paying a lot less than I was with BG.  Well done to isupplyenergy.
4535|They completely messed up setting up my account, ended up costing me more than if I had stayed with existing supplier. Then they told me they would put things right. They didn't.This bunch are a complete joke!
4536|The other reviews actually flatter this company. They have no right to be in business. For six months I have been trying to get them to give my previous supplier a reading so that I can close the account and get my final bill. I have sent them loads of readings and still have an estimated bill for the first quarter that is more than half of what I paid in the whole of last year, etc, etc.And today the grand finale! Out of the blue I received an e-mail reducing my monthly payments from GBP106 to GBP71 - GREAT until I realised it included all my bank details to confirm. Was it spam, God knows, the website is having its usual routine miantenance and I know the phone is hopeless. So I'll just leave an e-mail and think about throwing myself off a tall building tomorrow.
4537|I want to cancel my account within the 7 days cool off period and surprisingly I can not do it over the phone I have to login but guess what I can't login as the web site is down each time I have tried. Funny that isn't it. I would avoid this like the plague. Poor communication all one way all mail is do not reply addresses. 
4538|After using a comparison site I applied for change of supplier - I was advised that they couldn't as I was on a pre-pay meter (untrue).  I told them I wasn't, they checked and confirmed I wasn't and said they would process and didn't.  Prices went up.  Reapplied and they said I was on a pre-pay meter (untrue and previously checked by them) and they said they would process and didn't.  In the interim I could have gone with another competent supplier, saved a fortune on contacting them and still with my original supplier.  Isupply Energy are totally incompetent!!
4539|isupplyENERGY but NOT Customer Service! Hopeless, useless, jobsworth, MUPPETS that could not run a BATH let alone an energy company! Their so-called Customer Service, (if you're lucky enough to get any at all from them), is truly THE WORST! In an industry rife with dreadful Customer Service isupplyenergy seem to have managed to plummet to the bottom, achieving new depths lower than any I have previously encountered with 5 different energy suppliers in 6 years!Virtually impossible to deal with! SLOW to respond to queries, (if at all), and usually just ignore what you have said when and if they bother to reply.I have been trying to get them to see sense over an OVER CHARGE that even a FIVE YEAR OLD could see but isupplyenergy can't! They are incapable of basic mathematics!AVOID!!!
4540|Stay well away from this company, they do not do CUSTOMER SERVICE, their staff are rude uneducated and unable to comrehend what a simple request is. ABSOULTE PATHETIC COMPANY 
4541|Their customer service number, you have to record a message when you have selected to speak to someone and they then don't get back to you. They took nearly double the previously agreed direct debit from my account without warning or authorisation after I had swapped to another supplier. Then they told me sorry, but it will take 28 days to give it back. Will never use them again and definitely wouldn't recommend them to anyone
4542|No bills received for nearly a year,blamed computer issues, stopped taking direct debits, blamed computer issues.  No prices on their websiteCan take up to a month to reply to your emails. Worried about getting into debt.
4543|I would never recommend this company to anyone.  I queued for ages to speak to someone only to get an answer machine, sent several messages without a single reply for 42 days.  That was only after i had cancelled my direct debit to them as i had moved out of the property a month before. Don't be fooled by the cheap tariff as my bill was over GBP100 in the summer without heating on in a two bedroom flat. Avoid at all costs.  
4544|I tried to change my account to this company in August 13 now in Dec 13 I am still with my original supplier and the transfer has not taken place. The only thing isupply have managed very efficiently is to remove a large sum of money from my bank account via direct debit. It's taken around 15-20 minutes wait to speak to an operator every time I have called. Emails go unanswered, promises are broken. This seems to be shoe string outfit that probably won't last long. My advice choose more carefully than I did!  
4545|Impossible to contact.  They never reply on their email messaging service and if you try to call you eventually get to an answerphone where you leave a message and they do not reply!  My account was over GBP250 in credit and I wanted the money back that was all.  I could not make contact with them to get the money back.  I moved my account to another supplier.  You might pay a little bit more but for customer service I am happy to pay a bit more. Shockingly bad.  Take your business elsewhere. 
4546|Isupply energy price's are the best thing about them however don't even think about customer service, they don't have any.  Ever thing is done via email and they like to chop and change the direct debit amounts as it suits them so you always have an excess in their account which can be GBP200.  They don't refund and they do not respond to polite requests.  The place is run by robots as no one answers the phone.  There are other now with just as good deals.
4547|"I was very happy with isupplyenergy for one year. They supplied cheap electricity with no problems. Then I tried to renew ...The website said ""unexpected error, try again."" I tried many times, but no luck. I emailed customer support - no reply. I phoned - just got put in a queue then cut off.So I find that I have to leave, because they simply won't allow me to renew. Hopeless!"
4548|I echo comments  above. I think I'll be paying the 30 pound exit fee just to get out. They are more than doubling my direct debit payments. I have been trying to call them now for several weeks to discuss it, and want to make a one off lump sum payment and keep direct debits lower. No response. No one answers the phone, no one calls you back, the call queue is a artifice as you only ever get through to an answering machine. I will never ever use this company again and I am currently in the process of complaining to the ombudsman.
4549|In 27 years of energy supply I may have been lucky but have never had a real issue.I have switched a couple of times and moved to isupplyenergy 7 months ago.Was not overly quick a process but got there. Gave a complete breakdown of 12 months usage and set up an accurate dd.After two bills which showed after the direct debits that I owed five pounds (less than 1% of what I had paid) they upped the direct debit by 65%.No details of calculations and no response to email other than a confirmation of what they were going to take.Unlike many we use more power over summer quarter as two children return from uni, also so hot this summer had to use fans for a while. Explained to isupplyenergy but no response.Isupplyenergy are set up to sell and not serve.Isupplyenergy contractually can up your dd when they like and by how much they like. Not looking forward to try and get my money back when I have to in five months when I leave them.Keep away from small players like isupplyenergy, they will get no publicity when they mistreat you. Just hope they don,t go bust.
4550|Hi all - can see several negative reviews here - my experience has actually been positive - have just renewed for a second year and used 4xcomparison sites before I recommited - they remain the cheapest for me and this is acknowledged by the comparison sites. I was automatically contacted more than a month prior to my contract end date (as per their blurb) and continuing was merely the press of a button. I did contact them prior to this to enquire about renewing early even if they could not waive the exit fee so late into the period - (I was frightened by the big 6 hikes) and if you dig deep enough on-line you can find a better tel number (a sister company that transfers you immediately)although in truth I did also get a fairly speedy response to my internal e-mail on the same subject. Unfortuanately once your supplied address is in the system with an annual contract number the IT at present is not sufficiently sophisticated to permit this early switch - no worries the difference between IFIX2013 (or is it 14?) 10 or 12 was not silly money but would have more than absorbed the exit fee so I would have preferred that as an option - hey ho they are a young company and their IT options may be seen to upgrade when they introduce dual fuel. I am sorry that there are some dissenters amongst the reviewers but I speak as I find
4551|I switched to isupplyenergy in November 2012, after nPower wanted to increase costs.  I found that isupply were the cheapest at the time and when I came to sign up again this November they were still the cheapest non dual fuel supplier.  I have Economy 7.All they want is a start meter reading and regular readings through the year.  This is very easy to do on their website, as is all communication.  They may not be the quickest at replying but they DO reply, and it's better than holding on the phone to get through to nPower.  I had underestimated the amount I would use and by October this year owed them GBP120.  Unlike nPower they did not chase this or put up the direct debit, in fact I contacted them and made an extra payment to cover it.  Just before the year was up I got an email with a new quote.  This was after the other energy companies had raised their prices but isupply was still the cheapest, so I'm sticking with them and saving a minimum of GBP59 a year. 
4552|Have been with isupplyenergy for a year now and have just signed up the mother in law who had a terrible time with npower.All in all am very pleased with the service and supply of this company and would not even consider going back to eon-npower-britishgas or whatever it's name is. I did find that my direct debit was set too low initially and contacted the company to have it altered and sent a cheque to cover the diff - they were a little slow in responding but hey what the heck I will give them the benefit of the doubt and stay with it. if more people came across to the smaller companies then possibly the grip of the monster firms may not be so tight on the industry - we do need more players to keep competition in the market - don't you agree?  
4553|I have been asking now for over 3 weeks what my tariff is and my off peak hours no reply to any emails or messages left it is time this company was brought to task my WATCHDOG and High - Lighted in the Press for how they are dealing with normal enquires.
4554|I found iSupplyEnergy via a price comparison site. They had the lowest tariff at the time. There were no reviews about them so thought I would give them a try. I was supposed to be switched over on 1/10. On 5/10 I got an email from my old supplier thanking me for remaining a customer. I tried to call iSupply for a couple of days, leaving messages, and never heard back. I emailed them. For 3 weeks I called and emailed daily to find out when I was going to be switched over. No response. By now I had spent a month on a standard tariff with my old supplier and all the savings I was supposed to see had been spent. I hit the price comparison sites again and found EDF to now be the cheapest. I signed up for their Fixed Tariff. Yesterday I got an email from iSupply saying they have received notice of my termination and will be disputing it! I haven't heard from them in months and all of a sudden they tell me I can't leave (although as far as I knew I was never switched in the first place). Now the battle to try and get in touch with them again so I can run away as fast as possible. Lesson learned: Stick with the cheapest tariff from one of the Big 6. You might pay a pound a month more than one of these little companies, but if something goes wrong at least you know you can actually speak to someone to resolve it. And please please please... stay away from iSupplyEnergy! I promise you WILL regret it if you don't.
4555|I have had no problems with this company, which I joined in January.  They have answered my emails, and charge me a fair rate.  If you want a no frills service, internet based, it's fine.
4556|This company is the worst company by far I have ever had the misfortune to go with no customer service what so ever never reply to emails or messages left on the phone. Being over charged by about GBP20 a month so now owed over GBP140 and by law they must issue a refund when it go's over GBP100 but just can not get hold of anyone to issue it. There a joke when my contract ends in march I will be leaving them I would rather pay more then have this in my life.
4557|My tariff is too high (by about GBP20 a month) - over 2 months ago I sent iSupply my meter reading, however I am not getting any responce from them other than an automated e-mail to say they have received my e-mail and 1 e-mail to say they were having problems with their system.  If you phone their number you ONLY get an answer machine, irrelevant of what option you use.  I regret going to iSupply and assume it will be as impossible to get through to them to terminate my contract.  Rubbish service.
4558|"I have to agree with other reviews. This company has the worst record I have found for customer service. When first joined 12 months ago it was good but since then has gone down hill fast. They ask all the time to message them as you cannot get an answer on the phone, put on hold then told 3 times your No1 in queue then told to message them. Don`t bother they don`t respond.They also don`t ring back when back you leave your phone number.I have today been asked to give meter reading, strange as I gave them one 7 days ago. Both times web site says thank you ""successful"".2nd time this has happened.I tried writing to a Director again no response. This was in respect of misleading info on changing tariff, ie not telling you the monthly charge until after agreeing to the change and trying to cover themselves by very small print at the foot of the page.(""if changing Sept to March the monthly charge is X 1.2"")(no where does it say reduces in April?).This is shown after agreeing to the tariff and printing documents.I have passed documents for this  to Office of Fair Trading at their request.I did message isupplyenergy over this query again no response.So if the account goes well Great if it goes wrong/ need info don`t expect assistance from them. "
4559|So apparently they are the cheapest, i have yet to see that. What i do know is that the customer service is terrible, you very rarely get hold of someone, and when you do they are just plain rude. Tamsin on customer service was rude unhelpful and spoke down to me in a manner that was just completely unacceptable. She needs some education and elocution lessons. I sent a number of emails, trying to get things sorted but only had 1 response out of 8 mails sent. Really not good enough. Don't see this company progressing, as we are selling the house i may just stay with them for the time being so i don't have to pay this mickey mouse company any cancelation charges, if in 1 month we haven't moved then i will change. The company just don't care, i should have stayed with CO-OP, biggest mistake moving to isupplyenergy.
4560|"I am an existing customer of isupplyenergy for electricity and whilst their prices are good, their response to questions is exceptionally poor.They rarely response to mails sent via their own web site excepting for an automated response message acknowledging receipt. Generally nothing thereafter!Phoning is rarely successful.  You are placed in a queue and are usually told that you are "" second""  After 4 or 5 minutes waiting, you are referred to the web page mail and the line disconnected.  It would appear that they do not want to talk as such a direct approach is difficult to ignore whilst an e mail can "" get lost in the system and disappear for ever"" I sent a meter reading through the web site on 17th June and still wait for a statement of account.The answer from them at last is that the statement cannot be prepared until the meter reading is validated by their "" Data collection team""  (Meter readers to the rest of us!)It would seem that I am the first person in their corporate history where the meter has reset to zero after reaching 99,999.  Try entering 00001 on the "" read your own meter page""  Their system cannot understand it!All I want is a record of my payments and usage within a reasonable period after advising the meter reading.  Is this expecting to much?"
4561|Used a comparison site for cheaper electric and came up with isupplyenergy as the best deal. Internet based service so not expecting full customer service, but was expecting a basic service.Their customer sales line is a call back service- they never called back. Tried 4 times to sign up to their service online, but there was always an error on their website. Emailed customer services for help, but got either no or no useful response.If I had this much trouble trying to give them business I hate to think what aggrevation I would get trying to deal with a problem once signed up.
4562|Each year at the end of my fixed term I look for a better deal with energy suppliers.  OVO were offering a really good deal for dual tariff at GBP126.00 (Feb 2013).  After 6 months I received an email stating that my bills were to be increased to GBP186.00 a month! I complained about this stating that I was a on FIXED TERM agreed contract and how they had reached this conclusion that my energy consumption had increased to GBP60.00 a month (bearing in mind this was in the Summer).  They apologised and rectified this error, three months later I received another email stating that my monthly tariff was to be increased again to GBP172.00.  Again I complained. I supplied a meter reading as requested in September and was informed that the readings were incorrect and they asked if we could send through a photo of our meter, I complied but could not send the images they requested as their mail box would not allow images to be sent! I complained and it took three months for them to get back to me and again they asked for meter readings. Again they stated that these were incorrect.By the time I switched over in February this year, they contacted me as I asked for a final bill as my account was over GBP300 in credit! They advised that the meter readings had been switched from day to night! And that they would rectify this issue to provide a final bill in the meantime they took another direct debit in March.   I complained requested again a final reading as the account was reading with GBP504.00 credit.  I was expecting that we would owe them as a final settlement but I discover that they took the final payment of GBP503.00!!!  Stating that this was because they had not billed me for electricity since September 2014! I have asked for a breakdown of this which they have provided and asked what the direct debits payments were for since September 2014 and they stated this was for gas. Needless to say I am still in dispute and have contacted the Ombudsman who have stated that I need to wait 8 weeks before lodging a complaint with them and to try and resolve the problem.  However OVO are claiming they are right and overwhelming with information on charges and consumption.
4563|"I took these jokers on because they quoted me what worked out at about GBP58 a month fixed for dual fuel, which they charged me for the first few months and then put it up to GBP131!! because they ""made a mistake"" (""Oooops! They said, like it was a friend spilling a bit of coffee on my rug).I've tried to say that in that case, let me leave as I can get a better deal elsewhere which they have refuted, skirted around or ignored and told me the welcome letter stated the price (I have it and it doesn't mention that) and then last month, they tried to put it up AGAIN to GBP171. All this with no breakdown as to why.They then moan that it's maybe because I don't send them meter readings every month (I asked for a smart meter but they said they didn't do them when I joined) but a rise of GBP113?!?!?! By not reading your meter?? What kind of madness is that??They then sent me an email on the 8th saying something about it being time to renew the contract (haha) or leave free of charge (which I obviously did) and then this evening I get an email saying that I owe them GBP308, again no breakdown of what is owed and why and apparently, a GBP60 fine for leaving!!!!Despite providing them with all the information and emails they sent me previously, usually contradicting whatever nonsense they'd sent me that day that I reply to, they choose to ignore this and ask for even more money.AVOID THESE CLOWNS."
4564|Moved into my property on the 1st Nov 2014, didn't see a bill for five months despite repeated calls, when I did finally get one through the door it was astronomical.. after almost an hour on the phone the girl on the other end realised that good old OVO had used the previous tenants opening reads as my own... adding 6 months of their usage to my bill.. thought it was all sorted.. not so.. a week later another crazy bill.. phoned up again, and I've been on the phone for half an hour so far with still no resolution.. The hold music which appears to have been lifted from a 14 year old girls Ipod doesn't help matters either.. I can only assume by previous reviews that this company were once good, I'm sorry to say, not any more.. Avoid at all costs.. 
4565|Ovo were a cheap supplier so I moved there been there a few years back. They consciously overcharge customers so you end up in credit for which they pay the customer interest. My payments mounted up to the point where I was GBP400+ in credit and I asked for a refund, they refused to refund me all and stated that I had to be two months in credit? They sent me a refund and over the next year quickly ended up again GBP480 in credit. I switched suppliers and they have so far taken 8 weeks to process a refund. My current supplier First Utility indicated to me that I had mixed up day and night rates but not to worry it was an obvious error and they had changed my meter submissions over so as to not cause issues. Ovo energy have again refused to refund my money stating that due to my error this will now take up to seventeen weeks to resolve, this is six months when you include the two months+ I have already waited. I am now in the process of involving Ofgem by way of complaint.I am not normally one to complain or post to these forums, but take my advice steer clear of this supplier!
4566|No escalation process for complaints.  Either put up or shut up - or go through the lengthy process of contacting OFGEM.What could be resolved in two minutes generally takes two hours.Missing paperwork, no apologies and rude staff all add up to a very poor experience.Check the OVO annual complaints report - the majority cannot be resolved immediately or within 24 hours.  This is due to a deliberate 'holding' process within customer services - no escalation procedure - in anticipation that customers just 'give up'.
4567|The switch over has been dreadful and numerous phone calls. Now in dispute over a nearly GBP3000 bill for gas . Now having to send pictures of Meter and have to send again as it has been implied that I have had the Meter changed. I am so stressed over this whole experience I would not recommend this company to anyone.
4568|I decided in December 2014 to look around for a new deal on my electric.  It was after this the problems started, trying to get a final bill proved to be one step too far for ovo.  I had little faith in what I was being told over the phone by way of excuses and reasoning, not least as calls were taking up to two hours!  How many people have this kind of time to spend on the phone? After being promised call backs that initially did not happen, further lengthy calls, a deadlock letter has been issued today, the 12 th March 2015.  The complaints procedure should be far more streamlined and condensed and no one should have to spend hours on the phone to try and get a final bill!
4569|Wow cannot believe the neg views about OVO on here because having been with awful companies like NPOWER and eon in the past OVO are in a different league.I am in the process of changing over from NPOWER to OVO and thus far the transaction has been smooth (NPOWER might try to spoil this) but OVO'S website and customer care staff are a million times better than NPOWERS who just fob you off or keep you waiting for ages b4 they reply...(in my own personal experience)...and I am going to save around GBP350++ a year with them so it was a no brainer to change over to OVO..my only regret is staying with NPOWER for so long because they are an awful company to deal with and their staff are about as useful as a chocolate teapot.Only time will tell if OVO are as good as my initial dealings with them but I really do believe that no company can be as bad as NPOWER.With NPOWER their fixed prices would go up without warning...and drop...I once had a credit of over GBP800 for several months...NPOWER were supposed to pay some of this back into my bank account...they did after many phone calls to the tune of a paltry GBP100+ within hours of contacting them my GBP800 credit disappeared ....and I was still paying around GBP120 a month duel fuel...oh often they would forget to take their monthly direct debit payment...and hit you with a payment of GBP300 to GBP500 to recover what they should have deducted off you and without warning so I incurred bank charges which the staff at NPOWER would just laugh at and in the same breath offer an insincere apology...the sooner NPOWER goes bust the better in my opinion because they are truly the worst company of any kind I have had the misfortune to deal with and I can fully understand why they get so many poor reviews and slated on programmes such as Watchdog.OVO at first hand...seem like a breath of fresh air compared to npower. 
4570|since may 2014 , not one problem to mention, very smooth transition and it does what it says on the tin. All done online, easy . would recommend. Very satisfied. Never needed customer service since moving over apart from very beginning but that was sorted very efficiently. overall very happy and can't complain. I have solar power and kept my FIT payments with old provider , this was not a problem at all. They are very transparent and I control my account without a hitch from my own home. 
4571|We spent over 20 years with British Gas at various properties. 3 years ago a comparison showed we could get a better deal with OVO so we switched but BG performed abysmally once they knew we were switching. I'd never go back. The OVO deals have been very competitive - in the top 3 on price - AND credit balances pay 3 per cent interest so you don't feel they're gaining from your overpayments. AND the online account management is brilliant allowing you to change the direct debit whenever you want. AND the customer service has been refreshingly excellent and that's worth a lot. No problems at all in 3 years. My mum-in-law has had really awful service from E.ON and has switched to OVO on our recommendation. So far, so good. In conclusion - E.F. Schumacher was right, small really is beautiful. I just hope they don't grow too big too quickly and turn into E.ON.
4572|When I transferred to Ovo I was promised a new smart meter, after six months of complaining I finally recieved a phone call to say that they would fit the meter the next day, I had credit on my old pre-payment meters. I was told by the engineer that the credit would transfer to my new smart meter within half an hour, It didn't so I called and was told that it  would transfer the next morning, it didn't, when I called again I was told that I should have let the credit run down on my old meters (I was given a days notice that they were coming) and that it could take eight weeks for me to get my money back. As I live on a very small budget I have no money to put on my new meter and so am left with no gas or electricity. So I have been left cold and hungry and told there is nothing they can do to help.
4573|I joined ovo energy in November 2014 & up to now I still have not had my meter fitted . I've had two appointments & the 1st one they never turned up . As I took a day from my work hoiladay I was not very happy . I will be receiving 42 pound credit when I finally get my meter fitted . The date is now the 10 of February & I was supposed to get my meter fitted today with they did turn up for about 10 minutes. After being told they needed a back board with they did not have & also was told that they needed a key from my landlord for the main building fuse cubbard as I was not informed about this with they said was down to me ( what a joke ) with I was not informed about I find this  unacceptable . as many people live in apartments blocks in London I find the meter installers very unprofessional in the way they communicate with the client . So after wasting another days hoiladay ive been told by ovo that the next appointment will be on the 14 of March . I have been very honest in my review & would advise people who are thinking of joining ovo to make shaw they don't get treated like me 
4574|Felt I had to write a review as most people seem to be slagging this company off!  They are by far the best energy provider we've had.  Used to be with n power who were an absolute joke.  I've  always spent time shopping around for the best deal.  They are by far the cheapest! Customer service is good and I've  always found them very helpful. Love the fact you get a bill each month once you've  given your readings, makes it so much easier to keep control of what you're using.  Direct debit is easy you change if you need to. 3% cash back if you have a credit balance. Have recommended  this company to friends and they share the same positive view about this company as i do.  Would definately recommend  ovo.
4575|THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE, JOINED APRIL 2014, NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE !! HAVE PRE-PAYMENT METERS, WERE NOT PROGRAMED CORRECTLEY LANDED ME WITH GBP240 DEBT, THEIR ERROR NOT MINE, I CHOSE PRE-PAYMENT SOLELY TO AVOID ANY DEBTS.CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BEYOND BELIEF SOME CALLS LASTING UP TO AN HOUR, MAINLY BEING PUT ON HOLD WHILE THEIR INCOMPITENT STAFF TRY TO FIND ANSWERS.AS FOR CHEAPER ENERGY I PAY ABOUT GBP80 - GBP100 PER WEEK TO AVOID BEING CUT OFF, I THINK THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY METERS AS I HAVE NEVER PAID THIS SORT OF MONEY BEFORE, HAVE BEEN ASKING THEM FOR OVER 5 MONTHS TO SEND ENGINEER TO COME AND INVESTIGATE MY METERS, I MAY AS WELL BANG MY HEAD AGAINST A BRICK WALL AS THEY'VE NO INTEREST IN HELPING ME AT ALL. MY EMAILS ARE IGNORED AS ARE MANY OF MY CALLS REQUESTING SOMEONE CALL BACKS FROM SENIOR STAFF. I CANNOT LOG ON TO MY ONLINE SERVICES THEY SEEM TO THINK I'M A CRANK MAKING IT ALL UP WITH NOTHING BETTER TO DO, I CANNOT WAIT TILL MY CONTRACT IS UP AND RETURN TO MY PREVIOUS SUPPLIER EON, WHO ARE NOT THE CHEAPEST BUT YOU GET A DECENT SERVICE FOR YOUR MONEY WHERE AS OVO ARE A TWO BOB OUTFIT CHARGING TOP DOLLAR.IF YOU ARE THINKING OF JOINING THIS COMPANY THINK VERY CAREFULLY AND DO SOME RESEARCH ON COSTING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE ADVICE I OFFER
4576|THEY HAD NEARLY 2000.00 POUND OF MY MONEY IN CREDIT,WHICH I WAS UNAWARE BECAUSE THEY CHANGED MY METERS AND DIDNT GET MY MONTHLY BILLS FOR NEARLY SIX MONTHS, DIDNT MAKE IT EASY TO GET BACK MY REFUND,IVE LEFT NOW,ALTHOUGH I HAVENT GOT A FINAL BILL WITH THE REST OF MY REFUND SUPPOSE ILL HAVE TO CHASE IT,JUST STAY AWAY,ABSOLUTLEY AWFUL
4577|I've had no trouble with them and the price is really good, although not the absolute cheapest. The customer service has always been very quick and friendly. They have time to talk to you and understand any problems you may have (i.e. we had an estate agent who gave the wrong reading at the beginning, causing no end of problems with the handover from N-Power, who were atrocious. The web site billing and account information is very easy to understand so you don't feel you're being bamboozled. Overall, easy, cheap and friendly - great!
4578|Put ten pound on my prepayment card took seven for debt (I'm not in debt with anyone) and they claim it's a standing charge because I went on emergency 70% taken because I used emergency and that's not including paying the emergency back!  Phoned customer service and they tried blaming it on a meter and tried forcing me into getting a smart meter which I didn't want because they can automatically take money off when ever they like or change the rates as they please unlike other meters where you have to wait until the next year if they told me all this before I switched I'd never of joined them  
4579|I telephoned OVO intending to start the process to switch to them but having been kept holding for a ridiculous length of time and having unnecessary music blaring down the phone I changed my mind. However, when I eventually gotthrough I gave them my initial impression of their company and was told 'we are busy'.  Not good. 
4580|Billing is a farce, gave meter readings only to have them guestimate a number a few days later.  Told I must have given too low a reading!!!! Excuse me No one was living in the house at the time, I was staying with friends & husband was dying in hospital.Failed to colect money for two months from direct debit, well in credit but payment was demamded there & then.  In the end they refunded one payment.Decided to leave at the end of the contract, informed Ovo, gave meter reading explaine dit was low as no one was in the house.  They continued to take money from my bank!  I am in credit by at least GBP150.Called up to request refund, told again I had left them & that they had confirmed this infomation by e mail.  Several hours later an email arrived welcoming me to my new plan.Now waiting for responce.   Would not recomend using them.
4581|I have had nothing but trouble from the start. First they forget to install the gas meter. They refused to transfer the credit from my old electric meter onto my new electric meter. I've had credit get inexplicably wiped from my account. The staff haven't got a clue. Their tarrif is not as low as they claim, in fact it's quite pricey. They're appalling at handling complaints. I want to leave after just 1 month but they want to punish me by fining me GBP30 for leaving them. Why should I pay for their mistakes?
4582|I have been with Ovo for 2 years, I signed up to a fixed deal over this period and was attracted at the time of going with someone that put customers first, rather than the big companies that dominate and treat customers poorly.That was a mistake.  Don't be fooled by the fancy App and Website, its not backed up with an efficient business.  Over the 2 years on 4 occassions they have for no reason sent me a final bill, charged me GBP30 for early exit as well and took a lot of my time (and money!) on phone calls, emails and revised readings etc to correct the mistakes.  It lasts a few months then the same happens again.The staff are pretty nice on the phone but they never solve the issue.  Promise the world, deliver a very poor service.  I have been with many suppliers, I put Ovo on a unique shelf with NPower and to be avoided at all costs.
4583|Having previously been with Sainsburys for a year who in conjunction with British gas ripped me off and despite paying GBP150 a month for a 3 bed house I still owed them nearly GBP600 when I left, with Ovo I have been paying GBP143 a month and I have had 2 refunds during the year of over GBP200 and I'm still in credit of GBP80..I cannot fault this company at all.I give my meter reading every month online which is the easiest website to navigate round and it tells me in a few days my balance and my usage which is just brilliant because I can keep control of my account. I also get 3% back on any credit which I know isn't a lot but every little bit help right! I've never been in credit after a year of being with a supplier until I switched to Ovo, I've always had to pay hundreds back at the end of the year so I'm happy with this supplier and will be renewing my contract soon. WELL DONE OVO!!!
4584|Looking forward to switching over it seemed like it was going to be easy. This is a smaller company growing extremely FAST and like most have hiccups. We had some hiccups by OVO was very good at trying to make us happy. In fact several hiccups but they made me feel valuable and important when calling and did listen being apologetic each time quite genuinely. If it wasn't for this and the unbiased metre engenier praising this company I would have left. In the end they got everything working perfect with over one month FREE electricity. Now we have fab new meter. Waiting times at most uk call centres isnt always good but I work for a company who is helping ovo to so know they have this in hand although this will take time.  
4585|I joined Ovo based on an online quotation from their website. The quote was worked out from my previous years gas and electricity bills and the monthly direct debit was set at the quoted GBP110. Six months into the contract, Ovo have informed me that I should pay GBP155 direct debit each month - this is an increase of GBP45 - a 40% increase!Either Ovo's quotation site is understating estimated charges or it has deliberately understated it as a lure for potential consumers?.Either way, I honestly can't wait for my contract with them to end. Our family is 2 adults and 2 children in a 3 bedroom terrace. I think GBP155 for gas and electricity each month is not only extortionate but so unaffordable and much more than my bills were before switching supplier. Ovo also don't take part in the winter fuel payments scheme. I am so disappointed that I chose Ovo, it is costing me a fortune. 
4586|Took over my gas supply without my authority and admitted to it but despite that a year later they still won't allow my original supplier, Eon, to take the supply back! 
4587|Decided to swap my pre payment meters to ovo smart meters which were fitted on wednesday this week,yesterday (friday) we had no elctric supply although we had almost GBP50 credit on card, rung them, 1 hour of witing on phone to speak to someone we was told that the elctric account hadnt been set up at their end. we have been given 1 catd & was expecting a display unit to b fitted but on wednesday was told this wasnt needed, yesterday was told it is needed so we can divide monies for each account. will be ringing them again this morning NOT HAPPY, they are only open half day today what happens in  amergency
4588|Cancelled 2 days after signup (well within the cool off period) as a number of things that they'd told me during the sign up turned out to be false and so they would not have been suitable for our needs. During signup the customer service wrote down the wrong address so all correspondence went to my elderly neighbour. I tried to rectify this but the error still continued until my neighbour was changed over to them without her consent even though it was in my name and had been cancelled. Her relatives have changed her back to the original company and today I received a phone call to say that they had to now apply the change to my address (even though it was cancelled and they don't know my address). They say they can do it just by postcode and my electricity supplier. I have asked my supplier to put a block on my account so hopefully that wont happen, I have a disabled person and their equipment which relies on electricity in the house so its rather worrying that we will be left without power.Despite repeated phone calls to them they are still insisting on trying to change me over. I didn't think these companies were still allowed to carry on this bullying behaviour any more, Ovo has proved me wrong.
4589|Went to ovo's website to see if it was cheaper to switch from npower and after putting in the tarrif i was on they quoted a lot less - so i moved - then after a while they increased their pricing dramatically to more than i was paying on npower - and now they want a penalty of 60 pounds to leave them - overall feel a bit cheated by them and wasted my time
4590|What a shambolic company.  It took them an eternity to transfer my supply to them, and despite their claims the only information I got about the process was when I chased them.  Then I made the mistake of letting them change me to a smart meter.  The job was done on time - but that was the only good thing.  The gizmo they give you to monitor your consumption doesn't work properly.  The now claim it will take the 16 (yes sixteen) weeks before they can give me a proper account again.  Once my deal expires I'm off!
4591|I swapped to OVO about five months ago and I have to say, so far so good. The website is excellent with some great stats on my usage against similar houses and dead simple interface which looks great. Far better than my previous supplier, Utility Warehouse.The prices are lower than UW and I like the 'read your meter' reminders just before the invoice is produced.I have only called them once and I thought the staff were fine, so I can't understand all the bad reviews here. Very glad I'm with them.
4592|I am on economy 7 , they recorded the initial readings I gave the over the phone in the wrong boxes, this was in January 2014. I pinged this out and was told oh it will sort itself out when we get other readings. It is now November 2014 and it still is not sorted out as they say that they are waiting for readings from my former supplier. My meter has been read twice since then and these readings have never been recorded. To date I have e mails off 12 different people and numerous phone calls, I have stopped my direct debit as I am currently GBP725.00'in credit, which they will not refund till the reading dispute is sorted out. Mr Steven Fitzpatrick need to look to his own small business before he comments on the big 6 as his staff are letting him down badly. 
4593|"WHEN ENTERING MY INITIAL READINGS ACCIDENTLY PUT MY ELEC READING INTO THE GAS BOX .I DID NOT ENTER ANYTHING ELSE AND IMMEDIATELY RANG THE COMPANY TOLD THEM  MY MISTAKE AND GAVE THEM THE CORRECT READINGS FOR BOTH GAS AND ELEC. IT TOOK SECONDS TO DO.AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS AND E-MAILS THEY EVENTUALLY TOLD ME THEY HAD PUT IN A ""DISPUTED READING"" (I DID NOT DISPUTE THE READINGS NOR DID THE PERSON I GAVE THE READINGS TO OVER THE PHONE) THEY DID NOT EVEN PUT IN THE ""DISPUTED READING"" UNTIL 12 WEEKS AFTER I GAVE THE CORRECT READING OVER THE PHONE!!  THEN THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD TAKE A FURTHER 12 WEEKS FOR THE "" DISPUTED READING"" TO BE PROCESSED. THAT WOULD BE A TOTAL OF 24 WEEKS (I RECTIFIED MY MISTAKE IN SECONDS ).IGAVE THEM AN EXTRA 2 WEEKS (A TOTAL OF 26 WEEKS OR 6 MONTHS BEFORE CONTACTING THE OMBUDSMAN."
4594|"I joined OVO ENERGY  just over a month ago from one of ""the big 6"". During the preamble to the switchover, and in fact during it also, they were attentive and communicative. However, once the switchover had occurred, it all started to go wrong. Firstly,they failed to take the first Direct debit, (which had been previously agreed, and was part of the contract). Then, when I sent them my first months meter readings on line, (which they confirmed receipt of),they ignored them completely when they generated my bill 2 days later, and presented me with an estimated bill. This had effectively increased ( theoretically),my months consumption of Gas BY 50% and my Electric by 18%. Needless to say,I questioned this and was initially fobbed of with a load of ""Guff"" Quoting ambient temperatures, 71 Years of weather statistics!!, and my past consumption history with Eon before them. None of this held any water whatsoever when viewed against the content of my original complaint.After writing to the Chief Executive, I was eventually contacted by a ""Service Resolution Specialist"" who trotted out the same old excuses, but after some discussion agreed to switch me to  Statements on Demand, which means that I will send them meter readings each month on a pre agreed date, and they will bill me accurately to those readings.----Isn`t that what is supposed to happen to all service users??  However, I will give them their chance to get things right as we move forward during the 12 months of my contract period. Unless things improve dramatically, I doubt that I will be repeating the experience. I must admit that reading many of the reviews on this site, I am not filled full of confidence"
4595|Tried to switch to them.. glad I didn't after reading reviews and as a result of my attempts! 1. I didn't take a name first time round.. guy didn't know if I could transfer 2 dual fuel supplies (in one building...left on hold for 8 minutes. I hung up. 2. Called back and attempted to get a name this time round... was told that she wouldn't give her surname... enough.. not even a customer yet - how do they treat you then?! 
4596|I am so upset with myself for joining this company - do they really exist outside of taking my money and a jolly facebook page.They totally ignore all communications, and have made my life a misery since joining them.You need to employ people who know what they are doing - and know how to deal with your customers complaints.I just want this sorted so I can move to another company.I signed on because I believed your jargon, and thought it was good that a 'new kid' on the block was entering the market, what a mistake.I could write reams of what you have done to my account, but I will not bore the readers, (it's all been covered by others).
4597|We have been with OVO for 6 months now and everything was great (including a seamless switch) until a month ago when they stopped including electricity readings in our bill due to an issue with their systems... and they have no idea when it will be fixed.
4598|We have been with OVO for 6 months now and everything was great (including a seamless switch) until a month ago when they stopped including gas readings in our bill due to an issue with their systems... and they have no idea when it will be fixed. 
4599|I'm an existing customer and I am awaiting the expiry of my contract so I cann switch to another provider. I have only ever managed to log into their website about 3 times as it wouldn't accept username, password or both no matter how often I tried setting up new passwords. They also have a very annoying policy of sending emails from no reply addresses, I had emailed them to complain about this and eventually received an email telling me to send my 'queries2 to the very email address I had already used. Cant wait to leave.
4600|We joined OVO 3 years ago and they were very good but as soon as something changes they don't seem to have a clue.  You speak to very nice people and seem to get things sorted out but when you check out your account online nothing has happened. We really wanted them to succeed.
4601|I have just come out of a 12 month fixed tariff, not sure if any other company will take me on now I have ovo smart meters fitted,ovo cant seem to work there smart meters, what chance has other company got in making them work, am I stuck with ovo or can I move ?
4602|HAVE BEEN WITH OVO ENERGY FOR 2 YEARS NOW FOR MY ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH THEM.  WEB SITE IS CLEAR AND EASY.  LIKE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO GIVE MONTHLY METER READINGS SO CAN MONITOR USUAGE.  HAVE DECREASED PAYMENTS AND APPLIED FOR REFUND WHICH ALL WENT SMOOTHLY.  I CANNOT FAULT THIS COMPANY.
4603|Applied online to switch to them more than two weeks ago. Received a confirmation email straightaway but have heard absolutely nothing since - no letters or emails. Emailed them a week ago and have received no reply. Tried calling them twice but given up after waiting more than 10 minutes (got straight through to British Gas when I spoke to them this morning). I guess the wait on the phones isn't unusual as they've gone to the effort of allowing you to choose your hold music. Not sure whether my energy is transferring or not - British Gas tell me it is, but already regretting the decision.
4604|We joined Ovo based on an online quotation from its website. The quote was based on the previous years gas and electricity and the monthly direct debit was set at the quoted GBP74. If anything, we're using less gas following the installation of a new boiler. Six months into the contract, Ovo have informed us we should pay GBP105 pcm - an increase of GBP31 - an increase of some 40%.Either Ovo's quotation site is understating estimated charges or it has deliberately understated it as a lure for potential consumers?.Take care when negotiating your contract with Ovo.
4605|Prior to completing application, I rang call centre because on line form omitted start date. I wanted to join when existing agreement with previous supplier had ended.Call centre told I could set start date once in receipt of welcome pack and I should not delay application as it was currently taking 3 weeks.On receipt of welcome pack I rang OVO giving required start date.Ovo sent email stating I would have to start earlier.I responded by email cancelling the application. All within the specifiedcooling off period and weeks before their given start date.After many communications and the deduction of monies from bank account, followed by  reimbursement of the same monies, OVO are now, through their recovery Agent, threatening legal action. I will update this post once the issue has been resolved by the Courts. Meanwhile be warned, record everything, keep copies and don't rely on the word of their call centre unless confirmed in writing. 
4606|I just don't have the energy to tell the full story it is SO long winded and the same as many on here.  I am in the process of writing a complaint letter to Mr OVO (the guy seen on Sky News Business recently bleating on about how cool a company they are)and am copying and pasting lots of the reviews on here into it as they all back up my story.In short, moved into new property and was stuck with them as my previous brilliant provider (Atlantic) could not take the account on for some reason.  Stuck with them until I had time to switch.  Quickly realised something wasn't right.  Very quickly I was GBP800ish in debit and my DD was increased to GBP198 a month - yes really!  I had to pay for a meter test in May which found meter running at 70% higher than it should.  Great - issue resolved.  NO.  I am still trying to get my refund.  They cant work out the credit correctly and I am just fed up with them.  This amounts to a lot of money they owe me.  They cant even do their maths.  My statement now says GBP293 credit + GBP100 direct debit = GBP154.00 credit?!?!  Seriously, they are muppets.  I have to pretend to be thick everytime I ring them so at least we are on the same level.  PLEASE PLEASE do not be tempted by cheap deals it is NOT worth it.  All correspondence arrives at least a week after the post date.  Just truly awful worse than NTL were and that's saying something.  It is worse than dealing with an non uk all centre trust me.

4608|"These people have taken something they should not. Well I was going to transfef my gas & electric to them on the 2nd August. I cancelled the transfer on the 7th, 12th and 16th August all within the 14 day cooling off period. Well now to cut a long story short Ovo have my gas supply! They have no explaination for this nor an appology. I am now on the 18th Sept and have an email saying ""we have been contacted by your new supplier is there anything we can do to make you stay"" REALLY!"
4609|Really disappointed with OVO, who have spectacularly failed to live up to their own hype.Months after transferring to them, and having received two confirmations that all was well, I'm receiving red bills from my old supplier. OVO have failed to take over the supply properly and I have spent lite recall hours on the telephone to resolve the matter - however, it still seems a long way from getting resolved.To add insult to injury, they have confirmed that after my last complaint some three weeks ago, they have not even requested my transfer from my old supplier.I truly wish that I hadn't moved to them and feel aggrieved that their 'hype' is just a cynical attempt to lull customers into believing they are different. Avoid.
4610|Moved to Ovo as thought they sounded good. It took almost six months for them to transfer my gas supply. Then they sent me a gas bill for over GBP800, apparently for gas I'd used over the Summer months (when I hardly use gas). They automatically increased my direct debit. After numerous calls I'm not much further in resolving the problem. I gave them an opening reading but they missed the first number of the reading meaning they've charged me for 2000 units. They've said it could take 14/16 weeks (depending on who you talk to) to fix this. In theory my gas account won't be functioning properly until almost ten months after my transfer to them! Very friendly staff but the one who said that he was 'willing to reduce my (wrong) direct debit amount as a gesture of goodwill' infuriated me. I regret moving to them. I wish I didn't but they haven't offered anything apart from shallow apologies, while I have had to spend hours trying to resolve their mistakes.
4611|Although we were satisfied with switching to ovo. Time passed and better deals became available elsewhere. We are regular switchers and never had any problems before over the 7 years before. But switching from ovo to another provider left us with over GBP250 credit owed back to us. After numerous calls to their team that blamed a third, independent party for the delay. When the final bill finally arrived it appeared they had decided to keep hold of the majority of our money, despite them confirming over the phone that we switched over 9 months ago. What kind of monkeys are doing the paperwork here? And how many people have been overlooked because it's too much stress and hassle to fight back? Disgusted. 
4612|Have been with OVO for 6 months now and must say am very pleased with them, the changeover was flawless, their web site is clear and precise, allowing me to take my own meter readings each month keeps me informed of my usage with the ability to adjust my payments in accordance with my monthly usage. Would recommend to family and friends without any hesitation.
4613|As mentioned previously cannot accept the complaints made. Been with OVO  5 months and the Switchover over perfect. Saved myself GBP50 per month and any contact I have had with them has been efficient and professional . Their web site is spot on and have already recommended them to family and friends
4614|Im posting to help others avoid what I have had to put up with from ovo, my advice is to avoid this company it is an immature, unprofessional business. I was with Ovo for 1 year and my experience was and continues to be awful. I paid a flat direct debit rate of GBP75 per month on the advice of Ovo however after calculating the costs manually it turns out I should have only been paying GBP46 per month! Im currently owed c. GBP300 however trying to get Ovo to return this to me is proving testing at best. The Ovo rep who Ive been speaking with is extremely rude and seemingly unwilling to assist me. Every question Ive asked has received a flaky non committal response, and the rep is seemingly unable to grasp what the key issues are. Ive had to threaten referral to Ofgem just to get Ovo to confirm my total charges breakdown vs. what Ive actually paid in writing. Ive now been told the accounts team are calculating this and they will confirm to me in 24 hrs. However once Ive got the confirmation it'll be a further battle to get the money back. Ive found the whole experience testing and whats made it worse is the attitude of the Ovo rep, who has told me various infuriating statements such as 1. the information on the online customer account are incorrect and shouldn't be trusted, 2. the standing charges are not included in the stated charge amounts and are hidden in the small print, 3. final statements take 6 weeks to produce, 4. my final statement showed Im owed GBP46 and when I queried what time period this was for was told for the month of August only not the whole charge period. In comparison Ive had zero issues with any other company, for example my water and tv license companies also owed me money and not only calculated the amount correctly but also credited this to my account within 3 working days. There are so many things wrong with Ovo ...AVOID AVOID AVOID! 
4615|I recently was offered a smart meter installation with the promise that it would show my energy consumption and warn me with l.e,d. indicators and a speedo type meter when my consumption was high etc. I had an owl meter before that did just that but was not as accurate as a 'smart' meter.I agreed to have it installed and the technicians arrived (only a few minutes late)and fitted the new smart gas and electric meters. the technicians showed us the meter that showed us our energy consumption.I was well pleased with the work but after they had gone I noticed that the display unit (a pipet 500)no longer showed my consumption. I consulted the user guide and that suggested that the normal view was to show the consumption. I rang customer services and a very pleasant young lady tried to help, but it was obvious she didn't have a clue. she got onto the 'smart' team who would not speak to me and kept giving her messages to pass on to me. eventually they concluded that the display was correct and that I had to press buttons to find out my consumption.I have spoken to other people with smart meters and theirs tell them their consumption all the time (without having to ask!) it seems not very 'smart' to have a display that does not show how much energy you use unless you ask it! indeed as it has to be plugged in it appears to be a waste of energy! I hope ovo get their act together so that I can recommend them to friends and family again. 
4616|OVO is the worst company ever to deal with customers.I deeply regret moving my electricity to OVO.I never have been so stressed out about moving from one provider to another, I cannot wait for the year to be over so I can stop using OVO.You gave the wrong meter reading to my previous provider and when I phoned to complain you DID NOTHING and still have done NOTHING to solve the situation.I have been sent to a debt collector from my previous provider because you dont want to solve this situation only because YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS
4617|I am always able to speak to a representative, who I can understand. Polite and helpful, seems good value up to now, although I feel that they could be a little more 'upfront' with their customers. I was well over GBP100 in credit, and asked for a refund, my next direct debit payment due in two weeks. Was informed that could only refund excess over my DD monthly payment, and that it could take a staggering 14 days to reach my bank. WHY? my DD payments can leave my bank in 24 hours, so why this massive delay in refunds ??????
4618|I think this company is a victim of serial complainers.I have been with them for about 8 months and haven't had any problems.I am paying approximately GBP60 per month less than at my previous supplier (BG)and Ovo say that I am still paying too much. Also when I asked to change my payment date it was done straight away with no problem.Also I like that you get paid interest on any money you've overpaid at a higher rate than the banks pay.I can't see anything to complain about.
4619|This company haven't got a clue, I now have so may incorrect bills I am using them as a stool!!!!  There is a complete disconnect between customer care and the billing department.  Whomever you speak to are polite and tell you that your issues have been resolved but then you get the next wrong bill!  I am not sure the informal language is suitable when complaints are being made for the umpteenth time.  Hopefully they will resolve my issue soon and I can get back to my life!
4620|I champion companies who use logic and common sense. OVO do this. Case in point, I asked for my direct debit to be lowered as was continually in credit by over GBP80. They looked at my usage, payment history and realised it was logical for it to be lowered and it worked for me, the customer. Even though it's better for a company to have the money sat in their bank account even when a customer is in credit.Other energy companies would have simply declined or made it difficult to communicate with (lots of questions etc) before agreeing.  This I know as this is what happened to me.#OVOlogicalthinkers 
4621|Switch went well nice people and they pick up the phone fast my gas meter was changed, not their doing and it has taken 30 phone calls and e mails. 2 complaints to a senior supervisor. and my account is still wrong What a shame, it started so well. as my account is still wrong after 4 months I give them 1/10 try else where Andy - Redcar
4622|Firstly they switched my neighbours supply (we're one of four properties), then they charged me for their electricity.  The they sent me a notice telling me when to read my meter - but with no dates in it.Absolute rubbish.Oh - and they're just as useless on the phone - they are really nice - but stupid.
4623|So wish I had joined ovo earlier, big problems with my last supplier, can't believe how easy it is to speak to someone straight away, no waiting , brilliant online account information, highly recommend, join ovo and quit the big six !
4624|Don't understand the negative reviews! I switched both gas and electricity in May this year and have had no problems. The website is very clear and easy to use. The smart phone app is really clever and allows you to enter meter readings directly whilst at your meter. It even activates my phone torch in case it's dark. You can control your own level of payments through your account depending on how much energy you have consumed and are predicted to consume. My bills have reduced by about GBP25 per month.
4625|I switched to Ovo with some trepidation as they are a small company, but we have been so pleased with the service they gave us. The switch over was smooth and we were kept informed all the way. They remind you to input meter readings monthly and then provide a detailed breakdown of cost. It is all so clear and straightforward.If you have to ring customer service the phone is answered quickly not like the endless long waiting times with EDF and the staff are friendly and helpful. Altogether a very pleasant experience and I would recommend them to anyone. Get away from the big 6!!
4626|What a breath of fresh air helpful friendly people the bills are so easy to understand would recommend to everyone
4627|Having switched to dual fuel with OVO in mid February, after agreeing a monthly cost for both gas & electricity - and extrscting same from my bank account - they have been unable to tell me how much the real cost of my gas is. In fact, they haven't been able to give me any indication, whatsoever, as to how indebted (or otherwise) I was for the gas component of this deal, so I had no idea of whether I owed them anything or whether they owed me anything.Six months into a 12 month contract, they finally tell me that they owe me close to GBP200.00. They brag about giving 3% interest on money lodged with them, who cares? In comparison, the 3% is derisory on GBP200.00 and that money is better in my bank than theirs! The interest inducement is a sham.On top of this, when I agreed to switch to OVO through 'uswitch', I was told that my winter monthly payment would drop by 25% at the start of the summer. That hasn't happened and now I've got to chase that up myself, because if I left it to OVO, I'd never receive the reduction in payment which was explicitly stated at the time of switching (and one of the fundamental reasons for switching).I have already lodged a complaint against the manner in which OVO have handled my account and received a reference from OFGEM.Thought that OVO had a different ethos than the six majors however - on performance and experience - they are markedly worse. I will now be looking for another supplier outwith the big six....and OVO.
4628|"Recently joined OVO after seeing their CEO take on the big six in front of H of C select committee. All went well with switch (electricity only) with just minor unimportant delays. DD about right compared to previous supplier, price not the issue for switching. Due to a slight delay on my part in supplying 1st meter reading, estimated bill produced, which was well below the actual. The resultant cancellation of the estimated bill and production of the accurate one seems to have confused their system. The 'My OVO' statement screen does not actually add up. Following some phone calls, a screen shot of the 'My OVO' screen sent by email and more phone calls, I was told they were having problems with the 'My OVO' system, not sure about this! Customer advisers always pleasant not sure they understand the industry; being pleasant goes some way but is not always the answer if you want someone to understand your concerns. Have read most of the reviews below and since about March or so the OVO responses. Whilst not wishing to tell OVO how to run their business, responding to customers who are conplaining with ""would you like us to investigate"", is not clever; it should never ever get to the stage where customers express their views in the public arena. I know you have to end a letter with wording, but ""All the best from OVO"" is not appropriate. I am not disappointed I switched but would like to feel confident in giving them my gas supply as well - sadly do not feel that confidence at the moment. My review title says it all - using up to date street speech by their customer advisers and informal language in emails and on website is not adult. Clear messages, good pricing, friendly (but not overtedly so) customer advisers and above all the ability to understand customer concerns are hall marks of successful businesses - take for example First Direct Bank."
4629|Switched from British Gas to OVO in February. Have had no issues - their mobile app is great for updating meter readings and website extremely clear and easy to use.  You can change your direct debit amount easily.  Have definitely been the best energy company I've had to deal with compared to British Gas (who were decent, but expensive), nPower and EDF (both of whom were horrendous).
4630|Despite all the poor reviews on this site, the Which report (http://www.which.co.uk/switch/news/2011/01/best-and-worst-energy-companies-revealed-243074) shows that OVO was one of the best providers. Having spent many years being unsatisfied with British Gas, I'm very pleased to have changed to OVO and will be saving over GBP400 per year on my dual fuel.
4631|This is an appalling company. I opted for ovo due to their renewable energy policy. I have made no less than 30 phone calls to them in the past 3 months due to a range of endless problems. Firstly for charging us for gas they were not supplying, having the wrong details on file, not submitting a GBP300 refund that was owed and the a further string of calls to try and close my account, receive more money owed and to correct discrepancies on my account. As yet they continue to bill me for a property I no longer live in, not to mention charging me a fee to close the account. I will ensure I never recommend them. I now have to use a company that does not supply renewable energy, something I feel strongly against, however I am unable to commit the time and money that is required by Ovo due to such poor organisation and customer service. 
4632|OVO have been a disaster for me.  I have spent more time on the phone trying to sort out my account than i ever did with my last provider (and they were frustrating enough).Do not use them.  i plan to change when they give me my money back.  3% interest on any money they hold hostage is not worth the hassle.
4633|"Made the change to Ovo to get a better deal, rang up with my gas meter reading Ovo member of staff ""misheard"" my reading and previous supplier now asking me for a huge amount of money. Contacted Ovo by phone several times as they DO NOT answer email inquiries. Then told it will take 12 weeks to sort out my problem???? What a shambles. Now regret changing to Ovo. Wasting lots of my time and energy on this matter.  Be warned."
4634|"My experience with the energy supplier Ovo is one that I inherited through a tenant who changed supplier to Ovo.  My problems with them just go on and on and on.  Initially, as I knew nothing about the company I left the supply with them as another tenant was moving in and they would probably change it again anyway.There was a gap of about 4 days between the first and second tenant and I had to make so many phone calls to them it was unbelievable, lasting in total for hours and hours all to no avail.  They say they will phone back but rarely ever do and when they do you have to start the same conversation over again and when you are talking to them you can tell they have had very little if any training.My problems have been magnified over the last few weeks as the latest tenant has now moved and it's quite obvious they are told to hang onto the customer as long as possible as they are making money all the time so they drag their feet.  The property I refer to is about 5 miles away from my home and I have worn ruts in the road travelling backwards and forwards taking meter readings.  I have taken enough meter readings to run a letting agency and am paid up to the minute with the bill.I'm changing to another supplier and they have been refused on several occasions because I owe Ovo money and I don't.  I then phone ovo and they say it was a mistake and they will put it right.  So I then phone the new supplier up and repeat what Ovo have said and give them new readings yet again and I think that's finally over.  Within a week I receive another letter from my new supplier who tell me that Ovo have refused again to hand over but of course it's an Ovo  mistake and they will put it right.I'm bad tempered, stressed and altogether grumpy about everything with everyone.   Believe it or not but all this information is just the tip of the Ovo iceberg, if I was inclined, I could write a book on their ""sayings and tactics""I know what I'll do - I'll look up the energy supply onbudsman on line and see if I can complain.I read their website and oh I wish I had a qualification in cataloguing information and then pulling it all together as I have kept all times, dates, names, when they don't call back and all the HOURS I've waited while they talk to supervisors and sometimes cut me off anyway.This company is not fit to trade serving the public and that is my opinion.Will someone wiser then me answer me a question?Is life too short to make disfunctional suppliers toe the line or should we go for it - or should we start drinking copius amounts of alcohol."
4635|I signed up to Ovo Energy feeling pretty excited.That all changed... It took them over four months to actually switch me to their energy and their partner Lowri Beck took even long to install the smart meters. It was a nightmare as I was passed from pillar to post regarding installation and booking times for smart meter fitting.Meters have now been fitted and it doesn't get any better.The smart meters are anything but smart !!! The in home display's main purpose (to me) is to tell you daily how much this company is actually ripping you off by and constantly telling you to top-up!! It's all very complicated and the standing charges of nearly 40p per day for both gas and electric meters is utterly awful in every way!!! AVOID BY ALL COSTS. 
4636|After being with British Gas for 27 years i decided to switch, so i went on a  comparison site and found Ovo were the cheapest. Had no problems with switch over and the Ovo website is good.They actually reply to my e mails and seem very helpful. I seem to be on course to save around GBP400 a year on my Dual fuel bill.As i am on the flexible payment option i can get a certain amount refunded each month when i go into credit, also i can reduce my next monthly Direct Debit payment.Up to now i am happy with Ovo.
4637|Swapped from Npower in April this year. 1st bill from Ovo is 60000 units out. Tried to convince them something has gone wrong but they did not listen. Now they admit that they swapped someone else's meter by mistake. Still waiting for my money back. It's a nightmare to deal with them. Don't swap, might be some savings but diabolical customer service.
4638|I switched to OVO in February 2014,having been with them previously and having had no issues. I switched back to them after two years with Scottish Power, to take advantage of a slightly better deal,and now regret changing.What a difference!Issue 1. I was quoted a monthly direct debit payment lower than Scottish Power,but when my account was switched to OVO,they informed me that they would be debiting my account with a much higher figure because I was joining them in winter and they would reduce it for the summer months. It is now well into June and there is no sign of any intended reduuction. Consequently I am now grossly in credit.However,this should at least enable me to take advantage of the 3% 'Just'Reward.Which leads me to issue 2.Issue 2. Despite having been in credit for at least two months no Interest has been received to date.Issue 3. On line discount. Despite the fact that I am a duel fuel customer,OVO have only given me this discount for one fuel only and for two months only since I joined them in February.I have spoken with their representatives by telelephone on two occasions to-date.They were very polite and agreed to re-issue my Statements with the correct discounts,but nothing has happened.I have been with several energy suppliers in the past and have never experienced such a poor service. 
4639|Changed over to OVO in March 2013; initial email confirmed account opened and transition from scottish power in process. No further emails until May 2014 but had already made 3 direct debit payments to OVO and then Scottish Power took GBP400 out of my account. No meter reading requested from OVO. Telephoned OVO who said 'oh yes it looks like a glitch in the system has missed you; promised to raise a complaint, then wanted me to contact Scottish power to raise a complaint, promised me a 3 day refund and a telephone call back within a week for meter reading neither of which happened. Telephoned them with regards to this and they said they will raise a complaint about my complaint!!!! Dont switch
4640|No doubt the CEO is saving for a new car, because OVO have certainly accumulated enough of my money which I am struggling to get refunded and being on a pension I can ill afford to have my money elsewhere. Should have stayed with BG more expensive but so easy to communicate with. Will Ovo get my business after a year absolutely not, they should be thoroughly ashamed of how they treat there customers. The only consolation for me is that they are based just down the road so if my issues are not sorted out I can go and bang the desk and get stroppy, with a film crew from Points west in tow.
4641|Such a shame after terrible customer service with Scottish power i changed to ovo they werent the cheapest but had good customer service reviews. Unfortunately not for me they mismanaged the change over never asked me for my end meter readings and estimated them, way over what they were! So no Scottish power owe me money and want more to pay this bill which i dont owe . Ovo have been rubbish at sorting this out and have tokd me it will take 12 weeks!So hard when uou have a tight budget. Rubbish service look for a better provider will be leaving as soon as i can!
4642|My OVO Journey..... + The 'Original' price + The website and Android App BUT.... - The 'second' price after your first fix deal - The 'third' price after your second fixed deal - Your credit payments nice idea but meaningless seven with a GBP200+CR = less then 25pCR a month!! - Switching away - now for the real fun - Accept the switching fee away GBP30 FAIR but is it fair to take within days of requesting switch and then take MONTHS to refund a credit balance of GBP200+ - Switching according to the norm should take 6 weeks - DO NOT believe this hype it will take months with OVO - and you will be driven nuts by your e-mails for help going unanswered and your telephone calls for help being very politely taken with promises made after endless shuffling of calls to 3rd parties for advice only to be let down by promises to close account and give final bill and refund monies nor being met - Have funds to pay 2 x Energy suppliers for at least 3 months as OVO still take your DD and rightly your new supplier will want their DD....get the drift...expensive - OVO are do different to the 'big guys' - grim to deal with and only motivated by profit - New customers attain cheap deals at the expensive of loyal customers who pay the higher rates(OVO not alone on this practice) So I have in desperation have written to the Managing Director - no response Just a footnote the switching site - energyhelpline.com although polite offer no help when your switch does not go to plan - you the switcher are left to fight the good fight! although they get fees from users switching on their sites and indeed other comparable switching sites all get fees from the customer's switching.....
4643|DD was too high to begin with but they refused to accept. Big credit balance built up and asked for a refund 6 weeks ago. First they claim it can take 20 working days, then they claim 10 working days. More importantly the money is with them and not me. Every e mail contact takes them 5 days to respond adding another week to the process. When I am due a refund from other companies it takes place within 2 days not 20 (working) days!!!Avoid avoid avoid. 
4644|Signed up with OVO and sounded pretty good. For the first couple of months everything went fine apart from I couldn't even log into my account. Took them two months to sort that out. Then despite being on a standard tariff they told me there system had reverted me to a flexible direct debit system. I complained and fair play they refunded the extra money they took from me in less than a week. They assured me that the issue was now resolved. The month after surprise surprise did the same again and tried to charge me an additional 200% more that month. Naturally I was not impressed. Situation is still not resolved however what I can say is their customer services department are pleasant. There collections department on the other hand are absolutely atrocious. They are the most unpleasant people I've had the misfortune to deal with. Word of warning. DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM!!!!!!!!
4645|Dreadful Still battling with them, they have made the Mad Hatters Tea Party look sane. I provided readings at transfer and have paid up to those readings with previous supplier. They won't accept thos and aren't producing bills for the account meanwhile we are over GBP1000 in credit with a high monthly DD. Hopeless admin. Multiple phone calls and emails no further on.I plan to stop DD, use credit which I will have to calculate and change supplier.
4646|Began my switch from Eon via a switching site on 14/4.Email from Ovo on 15/4 saying they were going to send a letter.No letter arrived. Called on 29/4 and they had already began the switch despite my cooling off period being the 30th ( it was on the letter that I never received ).I told them to cancel it and they assured me that they would and they would confirm in an email.Checked with Eon and Ovo had not. Had to get eon to object. Spoke to Ovo and they were very confused with their own processes. Be very careful with these people. Customer service not very polished or efficient. Jury is well and truly out.
4647|I've only recently signed up with Ovo and haven't even been asked to submit my first meter reading yet, but I'm already regretting it. For starters, I should have received my welcome pack by now, but haven't. My 'cooling off' period has been and gone. I opted for email correspondence and haven't heard a thing. I had an argument on the phone with my previous fuel supplier, (insisting on speaking to senior management) and I feel another coming on with this company too if they don't get their act together soon. It's no use a rep. telling me to contact them to solve this, so forget it, I'm the customer here, (who's always right BTW) and they're supposed to be serving their customers, not their customers serving them. I know my rights. Sort it Ovo, for ALL your customers.
4648|I foolishly switched to OVO after seeing their CEO on Newsnight and being impressed. Switching has been a nightmare - endless confusion their end - and now they are taking two direct debits instead of one from our account for double what's due. I cannot get a customer ID AND CANNOT GET THEM TO ANSWER THE PHONE - they answer their new business enquiry line instantly but leave existing customer to languish - my partner got an answer after 20 minutes. Also the staff lie about what information they have and have not received, which does not help. Hugely disappointing - and they were meant to be a challenge to the big six!
4649|Despite lengthy telephone conversations with the polite customer service team during the past two months, I am still unable to access the balance/payments in my account . Once the account is opened , using the password provided by the advisor, there is no information offered. This problem was supposed to have been resolved .Consequently I am extremely disappointed and becoming very annoyed.
4650|I am having problems with ovo and wondered if other people were to, which led me to this review site. I am paying more like others on my monthly DD, I switched in Jan but still haven't been able to see my meter readings and energy consumption. I have trouble getting onto the website there are frequent server issues. Other issues too, staff are friendly and polite but very poorly informed and they don't seem to keep good records of previous calls/ correspondence. Keep well away from Ovo it is too much hassle. I am going to move ASAP but dreading more problems as other reviewers describe.I wish I had read these reviews first before switching
4651|Ovo were a bit disorganised to start with when I first went on supply, but other than that very good service.  All queries answered. Easy bills to understand.  If you contact them, you are answered straight away and very rarely get put in a queue and the staff are very polite.  Online system allows you to take control of your direct debits and how much you pay.  Also allows you to apply for a refund on your credit balance (although does not offer a full refund as it is their interst you stay in credit which makes sense). So far so good.  Would recommend.
4652|Avoid. They will massively overcharge you on your direct debit and when you ask for your money be prepared for a fight and a few lies thrown in as well from my experience. 
4653|I would never recommend this company, welcome pack arrived too late, amount of DD  much higher than quote. Trying to cancel the transfer is a nightmare, you can't do it online OVO gave no breathing time due to late arrival of welcome pack. Cancelled 7 days ago and OVO are still trying to go ahead with the transfer despite repeated instructions to cancel...... They are no trying to set up  the DD !!!! Staggeringly bad communication and customer service, god knows how we are going to get rid of them
4654|Put in motion the switch to OVO - thinking I would get cheaper energy.That was over 1 month ago. They responded by stating that my Welcome Pack would be with me in 7 days.NOTHING. Now a month later.E-mailed them ..... rang them ..... nothing!Their telephone number is 0800, which is pretty good - but, after ages waiting on the phone, I have simply given up!I had an idea, ring the number and press the option for 'New Customer thinking of joining' .......... I got an answer within a minute, odd that!!!!The kind lady said that as I had started the process she would pass me to Customer Services ....... oh, dear, another mammoth long time waiting - I gave up once more.So, basically, when they get you on board they ignore you completely - I wonder is I can stop the switch? I would rather pay GBP10 a month more to a company who actually want to talk to their customers.Do NOT join OVO ...... just DON'T!To OVO - get your Customer Services sorted out or lose every single new customer you have signed up - you are a disgrace! If I could have awarded 0 stars then I would have!!
4655|"I have recently switched to OVO Energy (duel fuel) and the first letter I got from OVO confirming the switch showed higher monthly amounts compared to the quote I received, and also Direct Debit payments must be made in ""ADVANCE"". I have looked at OVO Energy's website and it was not clearly stated that advance payment is required, although they highlight OVO will pay 3% interest rate for any accumulated credit. I switched my energy supply to OVO Energy partly due to good review by Which Report and will ask OVO Energy to be more transparent in their condition of contract. I hope I will get trouble free billing and good Customer Service from OVO Energy in the future.   "
4656|"All started well, agreed to pay circa GBP120 per month for combined services, after 3 months they started to take, without notice, GBP175 to allow for 'winter months' , I reminded them that it was only September and I would pay on an ad hoc basis for any over usage as I was already some GBP200 in credit!  I was bluntly told ""we pay you interest on your credit"", that may be the case but I want to use my money not bolster the cash flow or share value of Ovo. They also have attempted to over charge me nearly GBP180 and it's taking a long time to prove they are wrong with no customer service and aggressive demands.In summary - avoid avoid don't be fooled by cheaper rates , they are undeliverable, as for your money, why let Ovo hold it to their benefit - much better sat in your bank account than theirs! Shocking customer service levels "
4657|These guys came up in the best buy tables for a fix until June 2016 at no more than I am paying my current supplier. I tried to get a quote on their site but it could not recognise an annual usage figure insisting on using it as a monthly one! Rang and obtained a quote which seemed acceptable and signed up. Then I looked at the reviews on line (wrong order, I know). These were terrible but I decided to wait for the welcome pack before deciding what to do. When the letter came, Ovo had put me on the wrong tariff. This confirmed the opinions of the reviews that I had read and I promptly cancelled the contract in the cooling-off period. Phew, a lucky escape!
4658|my meter readings according to this company have shot through the roof, they now claim we have used GBP200.00 of energy in the last month.  We have asked them to put a smart meter in but they state they don't change meters for free and would have to charge us and if after they have tested the gas meter and found a fault they will refund us!!!stay away report to the energy ombudsman so other people know.
4659|I was initially really impressed with this fresh, new company. They seemed to offer what most major suppliers do not....the personal touch! The novelty soon wore off and it seems that all emails sent have disappeared into cyber space. The recommend a friend GBP20 has never surfaced! And their false readings, now rectified twice by me via the online system have been ignored. There seems to be a familiar theme with overcharges and OVO keeping your money if you're in credit .
4660|Stay away from this company.  They will overcharging you through direct debit,  and you will have to run after them for your money... 
4661|Seems hard to get your cash back. Once you have your final statement showing they have been overcharging you (GBP200 in my instance) - they do nothing. All requests for a refund of MY money have gone unanswered.
4662|I would pay more to avoid this frustratingly bad company. Problems started when they increased my direct debit without any consent or even a new meter reading, the increase was over double what I had been paying. I emailed to say that I didn't consent to this increase and they carried on regardless. I then phoned the company (which you have to pay for) and spent over an hour arguing about the increase which they finally reduced, however over the year they still took an extra GBP447 off me than they should.Finally when I cancelled with Ovo they took a extra months payment after sending my final statement, and I had to ring them to get my money back (more cost), which they don't pay interest on.My advice is to save yourself time and hassle and use a different supplier! 
4663|Swapped over to Ovo in November 2013, changed my mind and missed the cooling off period so accepted my fate as an OVO Customer. 1st Month they debited GBP194 from my account, 2nd month GBP194.00.. Call customer services and queried the amount stating that these debits would add up to a whapping GBP2328 per year (more than original Scottish Power) I stated that the amount wasn't authorised by myself even though customer services tell me that it was? After searching the internet and reading these reviews I've cancelled my direct debit with immediate effect and will stay with them until I've used up the GBP388 credit that I've paid them.
4664|Same problem as others here. Excessive monthly payments that they don't review periodically mean overpayments and big credits on accounts that thy wont repay because of lots of excuses and lots of emails/phone calls. 10-weeks since I first contacted them and still no repayment!Cheapest last year expensive this year.
4665|Joined OVO in October 2012 and just after joining got the benifit of my fixed price as there was a general increase in prices. 1 year later I look to renew and OVO want 28% increase Kwh rate so notified I would be leaving, cancelled DD and requested a refund of my GBP560 credit. It is now 5th January 2014 and I have been a Scottish Power customer for 10 weeks and still no refund from OVO. I honestly think this company is in trouble and plan to go for a winding up order through the courts if this money does not arrive in the next week.Awful company.
4666|Started a 12 month fixed contract with OVO in December 2012 and decided to move on when their new proposal was a 23% increase in rate per KWh.At the same time I discovered they had been overcharging per KWh against the original contract, to the extent that I was over GBP700 in credit when they finally recalculated, after several emails and waiting far too long for responses. They finally refunded GBP500 of this after some argument.Following my switch to a cheaper supplier, they issued a final statement on 24 December 2013, showing a balance due to me in excess of GBP200. Not only had they made no attempt to repay this by 3 January, they took another GBP200 direct debit on this date.Phoned them on 4 January, waited over 10 minutes for the phone to be answered and was then told it would take 5-6 days to get me a refund - funny when I can make an immediate transfer from my bank account!Now have several formal complaints with them, with a view to reporting to the regulator, particularly over the direct debit. Their MD talked a good game on breakfast TV, but clearly has neither the resources or systems to manage the business
4667|left OVO after 3 years as they hiked the prices right up, OK until I wanted my overpayment back which they said they overlooked???  the overpayment went from GBP300 down to about GBP105, I was promised this back in December 27th 2013, still no sign of it even though they have clearly removed the amount I am actually owed on my final statements, I have the emails from them and final statements and will take it further, this company is as dodgy as the rest
4668|"OVO pitch themselves as being particularly customer-friendly.  This is completely untrue.  This is my experience of them.1.  They set the monthly payment FAR too high for my previous usage - my fault I guess for not querying it.2.  Now they have GBP1000 of my money, and, now I want to change suppliers, they are being awkward about repaying it.  They have been through verification of the gas reading, but not yet the electricity meter.  They are insisting on retaining a full month's payment (GBP245)until they have had verification from my new supplier, even though my electricity expenditure has never been above GBP100 per month.3.  I spoke to them on the phone, and they agreed to repay all but GBP100 if I sent them a photo of the electricity meter.  This I did.  They then went back to their previous position of holding on to GBP245.I'm still arguing with them.....Recommendation:  avoid ""customer friendly"" OVO."
4669|"1.Cheapest prices on the market (for a 12 month contract) 2.When in credit there's a 3% reward credited to your energy account when your bill is taken. You can get the 3% reward of up to 12 x (YOUR DD per month) *(=GBP144 max for me - would need GBP4800 in account)Any credit refund should take 6 days.DON'T withdraw it before 6 months in credit or you'll LOSE the 3%!3.5% off your energy bill with flexible direct debit that YOU CAN SET!*(I'm only paying GBP12/month currently because I'm ~GBP2000 in credit)4.You can use ""stoozing"" (a promotional 0% interest credit card) to load up the account.5.Your conscience is clear because Ovoenergy is backing renewables!You have a choice of 15% or 100% renewable energy.(Would be nice if there was a sliding scale here & the interest reward on more expensive 100% renewable energy was greater - maybe 5% perhaps)"
4670|Whilst a customer ovo we would say they are very good with bills communication etc, however when you switch away from them and your account is in credit its a nightmare to get your money back. We switched on the 15th Sept 2103 and are still waiting    
4671|Just switched to ovo energy as they were cheapest on a comparison site agreed GBP118 over the phone . Welcome pack came , boom GBP148 ???? Are they mad .. So I cancelled policy before it started ,phew looks like I dodged a bullet there
4672|Having switched away from OVO for a cheaper deal and having left my last direct debit to be processed (as they requested on learning of the switch) my account (electricity only) was in credit (GBP80). Anyone in this position should be aware that although OVO is anxious to take your money automatically it does not repay it automatically on switching and account closure. YOU HAVE TO REQUEST THIS!!! They then tell you it will take 5 to 6 working days. When asked why because bank transfers now take one day I was advised that it is because they do none of the cross checking to confirm that your account is to be closed until you request repayment and as the advisor told me it has to go through several departments internally before the refund is instructed to their bank. FRANKLY FOR A COMPANY THAT SEEKS TO TAKE THE HIGH MORAL GROUND THIS IS SHAMEFUL. 
4673|I am now switching from these lot as my dual fuel tariff has increased by 38%. I saw the chairman on TV criticizing the big energy suppliers for their 10% increases. What a joke! Ovo have again increased my DD even though I'm over 2 months in credit (which they acknowledge). Ovo state that they like customers to be 2 months in credit - why? Even if you are in credit they still want to increase your monthly payment.
4674|I just moved in to a property where OVO supplied previous occupier. Told them I wanted to switch but they have objected because of debt of previous occupier. It looks like I am tied in to them for at least as long as it takes for them to recover the money from the other guy and possibly longer. They refuse to acknowledge phone calls I made to them on earlier occasions and pretend like its the first contact I have had with them.Nobody there will give their proper names so you can complain and all in all their customer service is completely non-existent.How their CEO has the gall to stand up and criticise other power suppliers when his company is probably the worst in the market is beyond me.Don't get me wrong they are all as bad when it comes to hiking bills but at least let me be the one to choose who robs me.
4675|This is my 3rd year on a fixed tariff with OVO. I have not had any problems in this time. Contacted customer service once and found them to be very helpfull and efficient. They do insist on keeping your account  in credit and will reduce your direct debit if you get too far overpaid.They of course will also increase it if your account falls in to arrears. I know other companies balance your account over the whole year but Ovo do not.   
4676|as an ex customer following your chairmans apearance before energy committee how do you justify 25% increase in your prices in february 2012
4677|Like many others, OVO put up my monthly payments despite joining at a lower tariff and a falling consumption. Now, 2 years on my meter has failed as has their economy seven timer that switches it, they are telling me that I will have to pay GBP700 to restore my electricity supply! That is 1.5 times my annual bill. Both EDF and the network suppliers say that I should not have to pay this. I am also having big problems in trying to get a response from this company and have now emailed the CEOI have been without heating for 3 weeks now!!! When a company starts playing tight money games, is it a sign that they are struggling to survive? Be warned
4678|Have one case against them with ombudsman and looks like I'll need another. They have wrongly billed me, overcharged, avoided replying to emails and been useless at just about everything.
4679|Been with this provider twice now and would recommend them at this point. Good communication, pleasant customer service staff, deal with your issues personally not just standard email responses! and green in lots of ways!Like this company alot!
4680|I've been with OVO for nearly 3 years with a rather mixed experience. The switching process and the first 18 months were great but halfway through the second fixed period they found out that they had been charging me for the wrong type of gas meter and I ended up with my direct debits nearly doubling.  Once the second year had finished they offered me a new deal but I wanted to check out the market before confirming the renewal. I hadn't read the small print which told me that the prices were only valid for a few days. When I came to renew they offered me a worse deal so I declined and went onto their standard variable tariff. I decided to switch suppliers about 6 weeks ago and the switch apparently went through on the 23rd of September. I sent in my meter readings to the new supplier which seemed to be accepted but I've just found out that, despite being in credit, OVO have taken another direct debit after the account was switched. They blamed the way their automated systems have been set up. They offered me a partial refund which would take 5-6 days to come through but I would have to wait for a full refund until their systems have confirmed the final readings. That's the sort of excuse I'd expect from a large unwieldy utility company - not a small company like OVO are supposed to be.
4681|This is the worst switch from I have ever had I have now been waiting over 3 months for GBP350 owed to me by this company - they have not taken my final meter reading though it has been provided - I have spent hours on the phone to them - useless. To add insult they are now sending me bills for GBP450 based on a reading they have completely fabricated - disgusted with this lot - stay away
4682|"I sent them an email asking ""please supply me with the following info if possible. My total spend on energy for a year e.g 3rd May 2012 - 02 April 2013 and please give me total Gas and Electricity units consumed in a year"" Their Response ""Good Morning / Afternoon XXXXX Thank you for your email and taking the time to contact us. If you have any other questions, please feel free to get in touch. We???re also keen to hear about your experience with us; would you mind answeringthree quick questions for us? Kind regards, I have since email asking for a reply even sent an email to CEO and nothing - I am now waiting for them to answer the phone 5 minutes so far. I will not stay with them when contract is up. Disgrace. "
4683|I inherited Ovo and objected in priciple to paying for a paper statement so decided to move... what system, despite submitting final readings, they will cunningly come up with an estimated reading that shows you owe them money - clever eh? Ergo you are not allowed to move until you have cleared the ficticious debt and since it all takes a very long time you will find the debt increasing.  It took nearly eight months and only today have I paid the final theoretical bill, lets hope they don't find another reason to keep me! Verdict - total rubbish. 
4684|We have been with Ovo soon after they commenced business.We have always stayed on a fixed tariff and each month send our meter reading to them the day prior to last day of month. They add the percentage to take the extra day into account and twice a year our meter is read. One time we thought the increase in DD was greater  than necessary to pay the higher yearly amount but an exchange of emails produced a satisfactory result. Several times we have phoned them and every time a friendly,cheerful voice has answered.
4685|Easy way to deal with them, I get  prompt replies, able to agree direct debit amount each other, getting % interest back my account and somehow friendly. 
4686|I could write a novel regarding the amount of problems I have had with this company.  Here's a short summary:1) They routinely mixed up my DAY and NIGHT readings (I have an Economy 7 meter);2) They routinely failed to take my direct debit, then sent me a threatening letter, then apologised, then failed to take the direct debit - etc. ad nauseum;3) They allowed their meter reader to leave a card pinned to my apartment's door entry system so my personal details were visible from the street;4) Their estimates and rationale for setting my direct debit is bizarre and non-sensical.  They seem to want credit balances all the time;5) Their website and mobile app is clunky and often doesn't work;6) They have exit fees - which I accept.  But they also insist that you fully pay up your account before you leave - i.e. they won't allow you to be sent a final bill.Overall the company seems to be trendy, flashy with no substance.
4687|I moved house and the last tenants were with Ovo so we gave them a go. Worst mistake!! After paying GBP60 a month with British gas for electric, Ovo said we had used GBP328 in 6 weeks!! Thats just Electric!! I emailed them saying I wanted a check done on the meter before I payed anything and heard nothing back. Today I have a letter off Ovo saying they had been in contact with me and I have ignored them (not heard a thing) so they are in the middle of court proceedings to gain entry to my home to put in a repayment meter and the cost of this to me is another GBP340 on my bill! Stay well away from them. 
4688|I was initially pleased with moving to Ovo. I switched to them on a deal which pegged my per unit cost of energy at 2010 prices (just before they went up massively), and those prices were considerably cheaper than my previous provider could offer. A year later, however, it transpired that they had accidentally been under-billing me via direct debit, and that I owed them nearly GBP500. However they accepted this had been their fault, and apologised it had taken so long to correct, so they allowed this to be paid off at GBP20 a month, which on the basis that it was their error I felt was reasonable. However after the fixed price aspect of the contract finished I saw my prices rocket above any other supplier. I was paying GBP60 a month more than N Power now charge me for gas & electricity. They seem to rely on people joining on these cheap deals then as soon as the initial period is over, charge far more than anyone else and hope you won't notice.My main gripe is the saga of switching. For reasons known only to OVO Energy, they have been billing my account long after I have switched to N Power. Alas getting the GBP350 owed to me from their admin department is akin to getting blood out of a stone. 
4689|Claimed to save me GBP200 a year they are in fact costing me about the same extra a year. They now want to charge me GBP60 to switch suppliers.I intend to refer them to Ofgem. Their customer service is equally poor they promise to ring you or contact you but rarely do. You have to email them at least twice.There is absolutely no redeeming features of this company 
4690|Very disappointed with this company. Found out recently that after 6 months of being with them they increased my Direct Debit with them from GBP113 to GBP156 a month solely on the basis of estimated meter readings.  In this time they never took a reading, or requested one from me, but surmised that 'because of the particularly cold winter we have had ' (their words) that they would have to increase my bills.  The reality is, from a meter reading taken today, that in 6 months with them I have averaged GBP95 a month (having started with them at the end of November this period includes the winter period), so really they should be dropping my bills, not increasing them to GBP156 over the summer period.  Come 3rd of June I will be GBP275 in credit with them but they will not drop my direct debit beyond GBP120.  Mightily hacked off.  They say that they aim that all their customers have at least 1 months bill credit in their account (and they do apparently pay 3% interest on this#), so be warned - they do operate very differently from other energy providers and in my experience they are not very transparent about this.
4691|Despite me giving them my previous years energy profile, they have raised my direct debit by 50% without either explanation or my consent, just at the point when my energy consumption has dropped by 60%, i'm paying GBP297 per month. They neither answer my questions or provide justification for their actions, they grab money because it suits them. Wont be using them next year and suggest you don't either.
4692|Ovo is very mixed. Cheap when I moved to it, independent and helpful. But their 'statements' are useless estimates (guesses) of my usage, their 'we're the best, we're so happy' tone on the web site is really irritating and when I sent a reasoned email about these, I received a fob off reply.
4693|AFTER BEING WITH BRITISH GAS AND SWALEC SEEN A BIG SAVING SINCE BEING WITH OVO FOR 6 MONTHS. EASY TO SUBMIT METER READINGS ONLINE AND CLEARLY SHOWS HOW MUCH GAS AND ELECTRIC YOU ARE USING CUSTOMER SERVICE FRIENDLY AND SUPPORTIVE. 
4694|Started with Ovo after moving into a new flat, they were the energy suppliers to the at the time so I used them to save time and they promised me a low monthly D/Debit, Which I questioned at the time as it seemed too low! But I was assured that what they had quoted was correct. 6 months later they more than doubled the D/Debit...their excuse was they had under estimated the usage. Last month they contacted me again to tell me I owed them over GBP900 because they had again under estimated AND also had been using the wrong meter readings for the 2 tariffs??????I Have now contacted the ombudsman for Ovo's failures, at the end of the day if you think you are in line with their quote/estimates you are going to continue to use the same energy amount, if they had got the estimates correct and the right way round I wouldnt owe them this huge amount as I would have made cut backs. I am a single parent of 2, disabeled due to an accident, now they want GBP196 p/month out of my GBP275 p/month spending budget?? am afraid they are going to have take me too court as you cant get blood out of a stone, and my kids come first.
4695|I joined Ovo about three years ago and I have to say, I'm baffled by the comments I see here. Ovo Energy is a company that puts the interests of its customers first. Take the Direct Debit review as an example: they initially overestimated my monthly payment so after 3 months, they decreased it by 20%! So clearly, the DD review works both ways. I had to change my meter because it was faulty. They handled everything brilliantly and even recommended me to change to an Economy 7 meter, based on my previous consumption. All of it, FOR FREE! Today, even if wholesale prices have increased tremendously, I pay less with Ovo than I did with my previous supplier! GO OVO!
4696|So contract states 'your direct debit will initially be set 25% higher. This temporary increase will make sure your account doesn't fall behind from the start' Well people my bill just went up by 50% DO not use Ovo they pester you for meter readings even though I am on a fixed price tarriff. Duping customers into thinking their deals are cheaper than other providers. DO NOT USE. You have been warned. 
4697|I don't usually write reviews on companies because i always allow for a bit of bad service with things. However this company is awful, i regret the day i signed with them. They were in fact a few pound more than the cheapest ones so we thought well, green energy pay a little more thats fine. Oh boy, were we wrong. They estimated us a figure that was fine and then three months later we apparently owed them more money than we had even paid them in total those three months something due to an error that was not our fault. Before signing with them i looked all over their website and seemed as though they were a very nice and understanding company unlike things i had heard of their rivals. All their statements on their website saying about fairness etc and valuing their customers is absolute rubbish. I went through a long long process of complaining and investigating into the error we are now paying for. I hate this company with a passion and wish i had NEVER signed up with them they are incompetent and useless. Makes me upset thinking about how we are going to pay back the money we now owe them because of their error. Please keep away from this company for your own mental health and bank balance. 
4698|Like most people I was attracted to Ovo by the cheapness of their tariff prices. However I have had nothing but problems with them from start to finish and they have taken over a year to resolve my transfer from NPower and still have not completed it.They set their Direct debits up so that you are always in credit. My account is now GBP500 in credit and they are still taking almost GBP100 per month from me. I keep trying to phone them but I have more chance of winning the lottery than getting through to their operators! Apparently all their operators are busy at the moment!Avoid Ovo, they may appear cheap but you will pay more in the long run! I regret the day I heard of them.
4699|AVOID OVO AT ALL COSTSBe very wary of OVO, they alter DD's upwards and use other very sharp business scams.I will be leaving as soon as possible and use a company that is honest in their dealings with customers.Pros- UK basedCons- Deceitful and devious.
4700|I joined OVO December 2012. DD of GBP129.00. As this was an amount that should balance my account over 12 months is was obvious that I would owe them money until the summer, the same as any other company. I have ended up owing them around GBP150.00 for the first 3 months, as one would expect. They have contacted me and say my direct debit should be increased to GBP181.00.Previously I was with southern electric and my DD was GBP122.00.They say they are cheap because they recoup any money owed over the next 3 months.I am a pensioner and find this increase to be difficult.There are also questions about what happens in 3 months, will it decrease to below GBP100, then back up just before winter?I am sure they are a good company, but they rely on positive cash flow to keep prices low.
4701|I switched to OVO after the other companies were forever increasing my direct debit to cover my 'increased useage'. I use an electricity meter so I know this is a lie and it is just to cover their increased wages. I found OVO to be cheap and chearful in a good way. there is no Nectar points or clubcard points to increase the cost of my power used. They do however give 3% intrest on credit balances. They do their bit for the rainforest by buying a space of rainforest per customer. This does two things. It saves that part from being cut down. And it also ofsets my personal usage of CO2. I have had my DD increased once but that was only a pound a month. I recommended OVO to my dad but he mentioned all the bad reviews online so I thought that I would come and write a positive review. Each time I submit a reading it is lower than the esimated reading. I can not imagine how much money I have saved by not using any of the big names
4702|decided to switch to ovo after looking on comparison site, big mistake, they messed up my transfer meter reading and blamed my previous supplier, the result being I ended up looking at a humungous,terrifying gas bill, after contacting the ovo customer services over the phone and being told countless times that they understood how upset I must be and they were doing their best to help , I was told it will take up to 12 weeks to sort this matter out.I contacted my previous supplier to ask them why they had submitted my closing reading to ovo in the wrong format, they could not understand what the problem was and worked out my approximate bill which should be about a tenth of what ovo said.I would never recommend this company to anyone.   
4703|Without going into too much detail, the main gripe is the amount of money they hold in credit. I have had to constantly press for this to be reviewed/refunded and my account has been in credit since I first started my contract. Despite always sending accurate meter readings, the amount taken has never been anywhere near sensible.Replies to emails seem to be very selective and very standard - skirting round the more difficult to justify issues.Finally, I am leaving them and they have stated that should my final statement be in credit, I will not automatically be offered a refund, I will have to ask for it! Sums up their policy on holding excess funds very nicely.
4704|i am into my second year with ovo energy and i can only commend them for their excellent service and cheap price. Their prices are consistently low compared with other providers. I had no problems with their switch over team. Everything went without a hitch. Their online only service takes a bit of getting used as it is a drastic change from the old fashioned postal bills and home meter readings but after a while u realise the website is a breeze and online bills only clutter your inbox. Would happily recommend them. 
4705|Joint company in April 2012 and worst mistake ever,would not use my opening meter reading until I cancelled my direct debit. Made payment directly into their bank account and they tried to say these payments were not made and not credit to there account(scanned receipts to them)they still denied payments.Payments were credited to account nearly over two months later and in the meantime received letters from debt collection agency. They take ages in replying to emails and you never get a proper response.Would not use again even if there tariff was half that of other suppliers.AVOID AVOID AVOID
4706|I've been with many different energy companies but OVO energy takes top on customer ripp-off. They do not stop your DD after your supply has changed and you need to hassle them for any refund or over-paid money. If you are not good with keeping your paper work in order, stay away from this company because you'll definately loose out.
4707|Having never switched and bills escalating over the years, I had a few moments and did a comparison. Ovo Energy came up as a good deal and, in trepidation, I signed up. It's clear from the beginning that this is an online account so it's not fair for other reviewers to complain that they don't get a paper bill. The switch happened as planned, I was informed throughout as to progress. My only problem came from my previous provider who overcharged me for the final account. (This was eventually sorted out but took several long phone calls)Ovo energy advise you to submit an online meter reading and, if your monthly payments mean that you are in credit, they give you interest! (Mine was 12p last month!) I've been giving them reading regularly, by putting a reminder on my phone and, so far, I have no complaints.Gone are the old days of loyalty discounts; you just have to shop around every year. I shall put a reminder that my tariff expires in November and go back to the switching site to compare again. 
4708|I felt I had to comment on my experience with OVO having seen the poor reviews here. I swapped to OVO in April at which time they were the best deal for me on the comparison sites. I love their website which is so friendly,helpful and simple.(Without all the baggage of the old faithful utility companies and I think I have been with all of them over the years!)They do like you to post meter readings monthly which is a pain, but it keeeps you on top of your usage which has a lot to be said for it. And you get a monthly online bill available. They have upped my DD quite a lot, but I assumed it was to make sure my payments covered my winter bills and I don't really mind as they pay 3% on credit balances.Am reserving judgement re the fifth star on the rating until a year is up. Will report back then!
4709|Having researched all the cos and deals, I switched to Ovo a couple of months ago and so far (fingers crossed) I am really impressed: clear communication and easy-to-understand bills, switch took place effortlessly as advised, estimated readings spot on, receiving 3% interest on amount I am in credit (lot more than the bank!). 
4710|Having read all the reviews below I don't really know why they have had problems. My experience with OVO has been brilliant. I have jst signed up for my 3rd consecutive fixed 12month contract. Whilst OVO require at least 1-2months credit balance they do give 3% interest on that credit balance. That means that they pay about twice as much in interest than most high street banks!The comparasion sites make OVO one of the cheapest around. The telephone answering is good.They do prefer e-mail billing which cuts costs for them but I do understand this can be a problem for some people.The account is always on line, you can input your meter readings at any time  and you can get a statement when ever you wish.I WOULD RECCOMEND OVO TO ANYONE.
4711|I was attracted to the supplier by their relatively low electricity unit prices. Initial impressions are favourable, the staff appear efficient and helpful but be aware of the problems I have encountered. Firstly it is a condition that a customer is one month in credit on their account. This is done by increasing the monthly direct debit amount in excess of the cost of energy used.Also, OVO will adjust your direct debit in the most unusual way. My energy bill is approximately GBP90.00 per month and I am GBP137.00 in credit. I have just been notified that they wish to increase my direct debit to GBP167.00 per month. This is so ridiculous that I have to assume that every attempt is being made to build up an unnecessary credit on my account. I will call them and they will probably adjust the amount of the direct debit but this is third time in as many months that I have had to call them to stop an automatic direct debit increase.Go with OVO but be prepared for sneaky direct debit increases.BE VIGILANT!
4712|"I chose OVO because of the environmentally friendly tarif (forgot the name) and arranged connection over the phone. At that time, the person must have get my email wrong.Well, next OVO subscribed me to ""email only"" billing which obviously never came but started to deduct money via direct debit.I contacted them via email to (a) first send a proper bill and (b) fix my email in their system.Now begins a very long story - basically it took me 30 mails and phone calls to somehow get my account fixed and receive a proper bill (they came up wit rubbish like ""this is sensitive information"" when I asked them to send a bill to the registered account of address XYZ etc etc). At that point I had cancelled my direct debit, so I wanted to transfer the money via online banking - just to note there is no bank transfer information anywhere on their bills ... and was in for another tens of emails to make them send me the account information (another piece of apparently sensitive information). Total joke. I cancelled after that experience.I overpaid, so they send me a bill to tell me they owe me money... without the cheque or any other indication how they actually plan to give it to me. You guess: another few emails.PS I very quickly stopped using the phone as that leaves only them with a record of the conversation, but not yourself - when I said I'll record the conversation they put the phone down. I can only recommend that to anybody dealing with companies like OVO. Hard to say whether it's incompetence or a attempt to deliberatly misleading the customer."
4713|I think some of the reviews on here of Ovo are rather unfair, and relate to a few limited circumstances. I signed up with Ovo just over a month ago, and whilst you could consider myself a relatatively new customer, their service so far has been brilliant, and their tarrifs, fair and well priced. Whilst I have found i pay a little more on the daily service charge with them, their lower price per KW works out that they are still cheaper than my previous supplier, who made nothing more than broken promises to me, especially on being concerned in helping me save money, with an iplan device which never turned up in the end... need i say more. These guys, whilst still new in the market, deserve a fair chance, and are at least trying to do their bit in being green, and protecting 1-acre of rain forest per customer. That's more than most other companies do. Thumbs up from me for now at least.
4714|"I joined ovo at my old flat and then when I moved, I used them again as they originally had been excellent. There was some discrepancies when I moved which should have set alarm bells going. I closed my account, and was issued a notice about my new account at the old address.For my new flat, the meter address was incorrect (it was inconsistent with all other addresses) - contact your new supplier I was told.Numerous calls, escalations, emails, letters, etc had to be done, and only the eventual escalation to Ofcom resolved the issue. I estimate I spent about 30 hours trying to resolve this. I have lost count of the number of promises that never came.Because of the address issue, new neighbours upstairs attempted (accidently) to take over my supply. When I received notice from Ovo, I called immediately to have it stopped, I received a second notice, I called to have it stopped, and was then told the supply had been transferred and was charged a GBP30 penalty, even though I was told that the supply had not been transferred when Ovo looked it up (oh yes you were transferred from Ovo to Ovo - that was the problem apparently). It seemed it was my fault for the transfer even though I told them to stop it immediately and non of it would have happened if, during the five months between moving in and trying to get the address changed they had actually done as they were told!I changed suppliers, and was in credit. Several months later, still no refund. Contacted Ovo and then forgot about it. (It was GBP60 and after the man days of effort to change the meter, I could live without the stress).Today, ELEVEN months after transferring I receieved an email saying it would refund it. I have changed bank accounts now. Even though I was told only one working day ago, the transfer has taken place to a closed bank account. I asked about the wait. It is because when the transfer takes place it is up to the customer to ASK for a refund of any credit. Their promise of interest on in credit balances stops when the contract is terminated (very convinient). Now I have to wait for the monies to be returned so they can send it by cheque. Why when DD instructions are set up would a company not automatically transfer back a balance. Even the meters had been ""officially"" read a couple of days after the transfer.Sorry Ovo you were good but somewhere in your success, you have become my worst nightmare."
4715|changing to ovo was the worst mistake they got readings wrong from the start blamed me & previous supplier took 12 months to correct their mistake absolute nightmare
4716|Similar to everyone else. Since starting with this company they have misread the readings, pretended they hadn't received any for two years, then accepted they had and just couldn't manage to input them at all. They will then blame every other company involved from Transco to Nasa to my bank for their own faults. It took eons for me to clawback the amount they had incorrectly charged me and when i finally ended the contract they continued to take DD's from my account even though i had emails from them specifically cancelling the contract. I'm now in yet another battle to reclaim money. How on earth Which? managed to give them awards is absolutey beyond me! The Ombudsman has advised to steer clear of the company because they can't keep their promises. Look for smaller greener companies that know what they are doing! The Energy sector has a bad name and these are fast becoming the worst of a bad bunch.And if i evere meet the team on their website i'll knock them senseless with their own, borrowed windmills...
4717|At first I was very impressed with these people.  Not too difficult to get hold of and very polite.  Easy to understand statements etc. I liked the idea of paying more in the winter and less in the summer.  I initially paid GBP90 dual fuel for winter, this was reduced to GBP60 in the summer.  I built up a credit of GBP100 (actually GBP160 but as per their terms, you have to keep one months DD amount in the kitty) So I asked for GBP100 back.  They duly obliged.  Days later I get a letter saying they have reviewed my account and are putting my bill up to GBP103 per month.  I assumed that this would have something to do with the refund and once the matter had been cleared up, the DD would continue at GBP60 (for the summer at least) Oh no, I have been told I have to stick to the GBP103 to build up a 'summer credit' of two month's worth of DD. This seems at total odds with their summer / winter charging policy.  After threats to leave I had this reduced to GBP90.  After submitting my actual readings I am GBP40 in credit, yet my bill is increasing by GBP30 per month. Work that one out, particularly when my bill should in theory increase again when it comes to winter.  In summary, I believe these people are running an intrest scam on their customer's money.  Avoid like the plague.  I won't be renewing my contract then it expires next year.
4718|At first site these people seem nice, new, Green and generally the good new guys on the energy block. I moved to them some months ago as it seemed a good idea and would produce a useful saving on my electricity bill. It was a mistake and I should have stayed where I was. I have been incorrectly billed since I signed up as I was put on an incorrect rate from inception. My monthly statements from them are horrendous. OVO have admitted the mistake but seem incapable or unwilling to rectify it for some reason in spite of numerous complaints. I am not even sure that the original estimate of saving on my electricity bills I got before I joined them was correct anyway. Beware of these people.
4719|"Ovo Energy was recently voted the UKs top gas and electricity supplier in the ""2010"" Which  Switch Consumer Satisfaction Survey only company not to put the prices up as ther wholesale price gas/electric has dropped "
4720|Hi all, just wanted to share my experience with Ovo with your selves and the nightmare continues, I have copied an email I sent to them which should fill you in below...I attach the last of my un-replied to emails to yourselves outlining the problems I have been having and your inability to resolve the issue with my account. I also left a phone message at the weekend and have had no reply to that. Phone calls to you are useless as all I ever get is  the dispute is still being looked at this is not a dispute but a provable mistake by yourselves which I have already proven but you don't seem to be able to rectify. I have lodged a complaint with the ombudsman today not only about the fact you can not resolve my problem but the fact you do not reply to any contact from myself and as a customer I have no way of being able to rectify your mistake. As I mention below I have Kept all correspondence from myself to you as proof and will be providing this to the ombudsman. HelloI have received an email saying you will be doubling my monthly direct debit from next month. The figures this has been calculated from are not correct. there is a dispute open at the moment since March as the statements have no real meter readings on even though I have supplied them and the figures are the wrong way around so the night and day rates are the wrong way around. I have sent photos and 2 sets of meter readings, The meter has been read by a meter reading company to prove this but still nothing has been sorted out. I called last week to discuss reducing my direct debit as I have worked out that I have been paying more than is owed using the correct meter readings and when they are applied the correct way around. I was told that it could not be reduced until the dispute was sorted.I have now received an email saying you will double my payments which has made me very frustrated with your service and if this is not resolved shortly I will look else where for my energy and am looking to speak to watchdog about how impossible it is to get any sense from phone calls to your company, The billing department will not make any changes to the account even when I have proved you have the wrong meter readings and they have been recorded the wrong way around. I have done all I can do and proved the correct readings and I refuse to pay double for your mistake on my account.I hope you resolve this as soon as possible, The miss managing and billing of my account is your fault and I expect you to rectify this and not for me to keep chasing you and stopping you from making further mistakes. I have been logging and saving all my calls and correspondence to your selves to use in the off chance you do not sort this out and will supply this to the ombudsman, watchdog and any other consumer complaints association and will not be leaving very negative reviews online to reflect my experience with yourselves if this is not rapidly rectified.End of email.....Today I received another statement saying I used GBP300 of electricity last month! 1 bed flat, economy 7, no heating since starting with Ovo, washing machine, heating water etc... done at night, no energy used during the day.
4721|Appalling customer service and continuous errors for the duration of the time I was with them. I left first utility in July 2013 and they are still billing me every month. I ring them and they promise it will be rectified so no more bills then next month I get another bill. Totally infuriating and when you ask to speak to a manager not one will speak to you. Awful company do not use them!!!!
4722|When I switched to FU my old supplier supplied incorrect details of my electricity meter (which had been replaced by a new one). It has taken over a year to stop FU charging me on the basis of estimates and to accept that I have a different meter. This has only been possible by contacting the Energy Ombudsman, whose instructions FU at first ignored, and then my Member of Parliament, when they finally took notice. I fail to understand how customer service can be so utterly terrible.
4723|This energy company needs to get its act together.   If they can't deliver they should not be in business.   I have had threatening letters that say I owe money when they owe ME money from nearly a year ago.   I have gone over to another provider which is very good but still I get letters saying I owe FU money.   I have given them meter readings by email, phone - which incidentally is a very expensive phone number as they do not have a local one and they don't answer (last one took over 25 mins ringing) and I gave up to be charged over GBP3 for one call.   I am constantly ringing them and being passed over to one and them the other person.  No one knows what they are going there!!    I have written to them only to be told that there is a technical issue with my bill.   What - after over 8 mths still cannot resolve this.   They estimated my bill and tell me I owe over GBP70.  All I used was around GBP6.   Anyone reading this do not - I repeat do not go with these clowns.
4724|I joined FU because of their supposed low prices and more importantly, the promise of a smart meter. My house was empty because of  refurbishment for 8 months. However the meter reader only took an initial reading from one of my meters, although he took a note of the other at my request. I also photographed meters. Then the fun started. My first DD was taken while i was on holiday and was incorrect, I kept being given estimated bills, FU refused to accept my meter readings because they were lower than their estimate and sent their own generated ones. Hours on the 'phone and many emails later they refused to accept the house was empty. They ignored my letter.They promised to send a meter reader, I am entitled to this because of my age and sight problems I had at the time. I was then told they never send out meter readers, which is a statuary requirement. Eventually I stopped the DD. I was threatened constantly with bailiffs, by phone and email. I wrote a long letter to the ombudsman with all my evidence. It took two days to collate. Meanwhile I changed to another company who seemed to be aware of the sort of problem i was having and sent out a meter reader. After weeks they found in my favour and I was promised compensation within a time frame. nothing happened so I called again to be told I still owed money and the threatening letters restarted. I wrote to the ombudsman again, Eventually this got sorted, i owed them nothing the first DDs had covered the standing charge I owed.I was sent GBP40 compensation. Months later I was called to ask how the recent smart meter installation had gone. I felt sorry for the poor girl who called. Incidentally my Big Six company's charge for fuel and SC is the same as FU's SC alone. A fixed amount, they have sent a rebate and lowered my DD recently without being asked.
4725|Put simply, great prices let down by amateurish office operations. Cant answer simple questions, don't have supervisors, don't have managers, don't have team leaders, and don't have much interest either. Didn't know who was the MD, or the CEO. They both need the sack for presiding over such a mess. Public scrutiny on the BBC WATCHDOG  programme doesn't seems to have any impact at all. The top echelon of management needs clearing out in order to get this company sorted out. Customer services is beyond repair and nothing gets done to deal with complaints or queries. Advice to senior management....get off the golf course and sort this mess out.
4726|"First Utility = WORST Utility provider - No online bills available from Nov 2013 to Oct 2014, then they changed account number due to an internal accounting issue, and I now can't get access on line other than to see the old account details. Despite over two dozen phone calls/emails over last 6mths and moving house in December, I still have not had a bill. They do of course have my money! I have disputed my final meter readings which they told me they take from a national database (?!) despite me phoning and submitting them on email the day I moved out. I've provided photographic evidence and they have ""escalated"" my complaint......so why am I still waiting. I have spent hours on the phone and sent so many emails but even when I finally was given a name for someone to deal with my complaint from their Customer Care Team (hilarious use of the words here!) when I phoned to talk to them nobody knew the department number or person, so suggested I log in and take it up on email......exactly what I've been doing for months and months without success. Someone, somewhere should be able to audit this disgusting and incompetent behaviour and total lack of customer service, and put a stop to it."
4727|To whom it may concern @ UswitchI would like to log a complaint about First Utility. As you can see from the email below I requested a changeover to them about 6 weeks ago (05/01/2015). On the 19th Jan 2015 I received a confirmation email from First Utility about my registration details. I waited for the changeover, yet received no further (email) notification. Hence, I have since been billed heftily, twice by my current supplier - British Gas.As you can imagine, I changed over to specifically save money. I have this evening (13/02/2015) contacted First utility. They had no record of an account actually being set up properly. This is because I apparently 'failed' their credit check. This nonplussed me as I pay my B/Gas bills through d/debit and have never had a failed payment. Apparently, they sent an email...Oh no, they did not (they admitted on the phone) notify me that the check had failed - on the 19th Jan. Hence, I have been waiting in limbo on the progress of the changeover since (almost a month!). All rather shambolic, and they did not offer much of an apology.They could offer no further information as to why I failed their credit check, but said I could switch to them immediately  - if, I pay them a 'security deposit' of GBP300 which I can NOT get back as either a credit or put towards my bills, until after they have billed me for the next 6 months. This all seems rather preposterous  - other to the tariff/s they actually  advertised through your site, and I will now have to look elsewhere for a new and cheaper fuel supplier. I would appreciate if you would further look into this company's practices to save other people the time, inconvenience, and yes ,money - in case they were to incur the same problems as I have. This GBP300 deposit clause should have been stipulated on their T & Cs and this was not advertised through uSwitch. I will be further contacting an ombudsman or official regulators  on this matter.
4728|First Utility are totally inept.  Totally messed up my account never answered emails, or letters.  Try to call them first night 82 in queue, next 92, in queue next 45 in queue.  Finally they sent a debt collector company to me even though I had asked time and time again for a final account.  Paid the debt company there and then, they gave me a GBP50 discount for all the inconvenience.  Three month later received an email saying that I owed GBP50.  Tried to email, with details of refund by debt collection agency, someone emailed back having not read the email saying I still owed the GBP50, spelt my name wrong on email. Finally called on hold 20 minutes, explained my situation then transferred to Credit control, left again on hold for 15 minutes.  Then gave up.  Written to Directors, no reply.Do not deal with this company, they say that they have invested thousands  in staff and training but the only thing they seem to have been trained in seems to be how to apologise, which is obviously needed.Now with Ova, although paying the same amount I have been in credit ever since I went with them so is First Utility the cheapest?
4729|I joined first utility as they were the cheapest on the market however I have now left them due to the awful customer service provided and completely messing my account up. I had so many problems with First Utility regarding my meter and each time I rang customer service I was told different information last time. I evencually wrote to Head office to which they responded and rang me to discuss further. I got that fed up with them that I moved over to OVO. They seem a lot better. I have not been with First Utility since May 2014. On the 23rd of December 2014 I receive an email from First Utility with the heading of the letter 'Payment Due' and that there records show that my energy account is now overdue by GBP110.54 pence!! At first I wondered if this was a final bill so I ring up First Utility to query this to which I was put through to the moving house team and asked why you had sent me this random letter and to also query with them why they keep continuing to send me emails and texts to tell me that my bill is now due! I haven't been with First Utility for 7 months... and they decided to send me this letter.  The moving house team apologised and said that I was still being billed as it looks like my online account hadn't been closed down to which she said to ignore this letter chasing payment and that she would also closed down my account. I asked about the final bill and her response was, yes I will try and find this for you! A couple of days later I receive and email from my current supplier (ovo) to say that they are sorry that I am leaving them. I was like what? so I email ovo to query this to which they said that they have had notification from energy supplier 'First utility' that they are now taking over my energy from the 20th of January..!!! I can not tell you how frustrated I am with this first utility. How difficult can it be to close an account down.. Please please please do not join first utility. Absolutely shocking.  
4730|Went with First Utility as they came out cheapest, what a mistake that turned out to be!I originally opted for monthly set payments as with my previous supplier. Of course this never happened despite numerous attempts at getting this set up. I've now been with them 18 months and have never once had an accurate gas bill. Each month they email asking for a reading, which I immiediately provide. Few days later I get an estimated bill which is wildly out from the reading provided (of course it's VERY overestimated). As a consequence I'm now around GBP800 in credit despite many calls, and many many more attempted calls, (they are rather adverse to answering the phone to existing customers) it's unresolved, as is my monthly payment amount. Avoid at all costs, they treat customers with utter contempt.
4731|Changed bank details over phone and online still kept taking money from old account and insisting that it was being taken from new one, every phone call on hold for at least 15 mins still not sorted out my problem all i want is to change bank detail surely not that hard is it, it is for first utility 
4732|This company does offer better than average energy prices but their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced during many years of dealing with utility companies.I have now left them mainly because I got a better deal elsewhere but I was strongly influenced by their dreadful customer service. It is almost impossible to reach them on the phone unless you have an hour to spare waiting for an answer. My final confrontation was when I left and I required them to refund GBP250 credit. After a month of no action I emailed them but four weeks later no reply. In between times I had written , put in three complaint forms, and tried to phone many times but gave up waiting. If you read their website they make all sorts of promises about customer services but it's all lies. They are far worst than the big six in my view. After two months I finally got through on the phone and hopefully will now get my money back but I still have to wait a further week ! Keep away if you value your sanity.
4733|Beware you will be charged GBP30 per fuel if you want to leave this outfit. My experience to date. Started off ok. Then I needed to make a change to my direct debit.Did the necessary on their site, and cancelled my existing arrangements. Nothing happened.No payments collected. It took 4 very irate telephone calls to get it sorted. Now,they have altered my direct debit from GBP64 a month to GBP89 per month without even asking me,even though Im GBP180.00 in credit. Not the way to keep my custom First Utility. I will be paying the GBP60 to get rid of you.
4734|There is not a tariff low enough that will make up for the absolutely horrendous customer service provided by First Utility.
4735|"We've been with First Utility since January 2013 and were very pleased originally. Any queries via email or the website used to be answered very quickly and the telephones used to be answered quickly.This is now a thing of the past. Now they are not even meeting their own 5 day target for answering queries submitted via their website. On submitting a complaint, they hint at 'delays' due to higher than normal demand! which is a concern.Around 400 homes lost their Gas Supply for several days in our area during September and we all got a letter from SGN (responsible for maintaining the network) stating that we would receive compensation via our Suppliers. Having heard that our Neighbours very quickly received a cheque from EDF (their suppliers), I tried to enquire of First Utility when we could expect to receive our cheque. - After 20 minutes waiting to speak to Customer Services at First Utility, the phone still wasn't answered. - On 19 October I sent a message via the website, this still hasn't been answered, I sent a further message after their five day target of answering messages. - That still hasn't been responded to. - I have now escalated that to a Formal Complaint via First Utility's dedicated complaints handling email address and that hasn't been answered either. - We have since received a bill (long after our neighbours received their compensation cheque from EDF) and the compensation does not even appear as a credit on our account!First Utility - ""What have you done with the money that I have to assume that SGN have paid you in order to compensate us for our loss of Gas Supply back in September?"" ""Why aren't you answering my queries?"""

4738|i joined this company in January and have had nothing but problems ever since. I have found it so hart to contact them and have spent around GBP60.00 on phone call trying to get through as every time i ring it says i am at least 30 in the queue. I have sent several emails and am not getting a reply. On the rare occasion i have got through by phone i have asked to be called back and this has never happend. I would not recomend that anyone uses this company as the customer service nil. It has got to the point it is making me ill because every day i am waiting for a email or a reply from them and never get. they have now changed my tarif without consulting me in person and i hope to god this has not got an early exit fee as i will be leaving asap. Total rubbish
4739|"The initial switch to them was fine and they may be OK if they get the bills right and you never need to contact them. But...........no replies to emails sent in desperation because they don't answer the phone. Eventually after much chasing an inaccurate reply arrived without a correct explanation for billing errors and they took the money anyhow. Still sending me round in circles and I don't need to know they are a ""fast growing company and they are recruiting new staff"". Too late for customers already suffering poor service. Hopeless.     "
4740|This company provided the gas and electric at my property when I moved in. Three months later I received my first bill, when I paid I gave new readings as the estimated were much higher than I was using. 9 days later I was issued another bill suggesting I was owing almost GBP140 that disregarded my readings. I rang and waited an age before speaking to an agent who took new readings and confirmed I was still in credit and he would annul the bill so nothing was to pay. I have since received several letters suggesting I owe money, the latest threatening me with a credit agency.  I have tried to ring, email and make contact through email to resolve the issue but no one will answer.  The irony is I couldn't pay if I did owe money as no one answers the phone.AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS
4741|I am writing this while on hold which has been over 20 mins and I have just got past half way in the que.And I am calling due to one of there errors for the second time.
4742|i joined first utility online, then cancelled next day, thought that was the end of the matter. 2 weeks later i get an email welcoming me to them.rang them up and waited 60 minutes on the phone to speak to someone, after 10 minutes they hung up on me, really angry that they did that.emailed them countless times because i was not going to ring back again after that and i can tell you now they did not reply to one email i sent them.they were quite happy to send emails when it suited them.the only way out is to apply to join another company and go through the process of leaving them, and i refused to pay their leaving fee. their emails get nastier and nastier as time goes on, but they will never reply to one of yours.if you think the big six are bad then you have seen nothing yet with this company, the stress this company put you under is unbelievable.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!! 
4743|This company is awful, we have been with this company more than six months that have not claimed direct debits thay have not gave us any bills paper or online, I'm fed up with ringing up chasing everything, it's always a technical problem over the phone no idea what we owe etc etc awful company stay away only good thing is the low standing chargers
4744|I have used other companies in the past where the service was very poor. while first utility gave me the best service. I will definitely recommned to my friends. 
4745|When we joined they agreed GBP94 per month direct debit. For last three months they've been helping themselves to GBP340 a month,  making annual bill for 3 bed house over 4K!!!!1 Cant get through on the phone. Did once and the guy was rude and unhelpful Where do I go now? this is 3rd time I've moved. 
4746|My first 6 months with this company seemed fine. BUT they increased my monthly payment by GBP40 per month, after which I was always in credit.  I left them and cancelled my direct debit, which was a good thing since they hadn't told the Billing section I'd left and they continued to charge me as normal at the end of the month.  I was still in credit but it took 3 emails - useless, slow responses, and 3 phone calls to get them to refund my money, by cheque, taking 15 days.  I was told they had to recalculate my bill as I had been overcharged, which meant another month to get another bill with the corrected amount.  A further credit was due which once again I had to email and call about to get them to refund it by cheque again - another 15 days.  It has taken them 2 months to refund my money - and only at my request.  Having read the other reviews here, I was lucky.
4747|This company cannot set up a direct Debit.  Four attempts.  You will end up with huge bill and lots of threatening letters.  You can't call them as you will be 66th in line.  Emailing the CEO will get a promise which will not be fulfilled. They will offer you GBP75 and then forget. Customer service and credit control do not communicate with each other Do not use 
4748|I have had endless problems with this horrible company, since I returned home from a holiday three months ago. My gas smart meter had stopped communicating with them and my bill for April was estimated. My new meter (not a smart meter) was installed by National Grid on 22nd May. Ever since then, they are refusing to accept my gas meter readings and charging me for gas I haven't used. I phoned in my reading for June, but the figure on my bill bore no resemblance to my reading. Obviously, in this weather I haven't had my heating on for more than two months and I haven't had my gas fire on, so I'm hardly using any gas at all, just a bit for my hot water. Thus, my meter readings are very low; too low for First Utility's liking. They are accusing me of submitting false readings. I emailed a photo of my gas meter reading yesterday and tweeted it. Guess what, First Utility still doesn't believe me! I cannot find words to express my disgust with this vile company.
4749|I have read so many  negative and bad experiences regarding First Utility and can only support this with my bad experiences of their so called customer care service. Do not allow yourself to be added to this list of bad experiences and stay away.
4750|Changed to First Utility from BG.They told me that they had not been given my readings by First Utility.Asked First Utility to submit them on Wednesday morning and was given the readings by First Utility by email today.British Gas contacted me before to say that,in fact,they were given the readings at the right time.Having read so many negative reviews of First Utility saying,No customer service,Don't reply to emails,Could not care less attitude,I must say that the email that I received was pleasant in terms,helpful in that I was invited to contact them should I have any further problems.To have experienced this level of service has given me confidence in the company whereas,due to a lot of negative reviews,I was full of trepidation.
4751|Cunning company KEEP AWAY from themWorst ever company .i never regretted a decision in my life like when joined First Utility. Joined them more than 2 years ago. Supplied the initial reading for the first 2 months with no problem. Failed to supply the 3rd month because we were away. They hugely overestimated my gas consumption . We have repeatedly supplied the right readings for almost two years, sent several emails, spoken on the phone several times to no avail. Left them 3 months ago thought they will refund me following my final bill but I was wrong . Put my complaint in writing and they promised to investigate in two months period but now more than 10 weeks and heard nothing. They owe me more thanGBP3000 . Now decided to take them to court and reported them to Watchdog Programme. People be aware of this cunning company and see the very bad public reviews
4752|If you are thinking of joining this company based on their price tariff then don't! Once they get you hooked in they will ramp up your direct debit. Mine increased from GBP54pm to GBP88pm when my account was only GBP14 in debit and it was going into the summer months. That's a 60% increase. When I rang their customer services (when you can actually get through!) they told me there was nothing they could do. There is too many other complaints to list as the whole 12 months I was with them was a complete nightmare. I've now changed suppliers and 3 months down the line I'm still chasing a final invoice from them. Totally incompetent.
4753|"It seems that energy companies either ""forget"" to take direct debits so we are then indebted to them and then have to set up a repayment plan or keep taking direct debits but won't produce a bill. My last bill was 26th December 2013..I have chased and chased and even got their Executive director for Customer Satisfaction involved but still no joy even though they appointed a specific person to deal with the problem...lots of nice words but no action. I did get through to a customer service rep and they told me that their IT system was designed for 500,000 customers and they had exceeded this and it had now broken which is why they could not produce any bills...their customer help line number tells you due to competitors price actions they are very busy recruiting new customers and can't answer the call to existing customers..this has been going on for 6 months. Basically sums up their attitude..keep getting new customers in , don't worry about the current ones and make sure you miss bill so they can't leave...don't know why this lot have not been fined by the ombudsman"
4754|First Utility are the worst company I have ever dealt with. After being with them for nearly a year, they still haven't collected anything from me by direct debit. It is impossible to get through to them by phone and emails to their support get no reply. I filled in my bank account details when I signed up, and I can see my bank details correctly entered in the billing area of their website, but nothing has been collected. I finally got through to them using their Twitter account, someone called me back, and told me they would set up the direct debit again. Three months have passed since then, and still they haven't collected anything. I have also discoverd after looking at my account that they withdrew the cheap tarrif that I originally signed up for, and moved me on to their really expensive everyday tarrif. I have started the process of moving to another company, but I know there is going to be a huge bill to pay before I can do that. If you're tempted to sign up with them, try ringing their support number first to road test how feels to be a customer. Prepare for a long wait.
4755|Without doubt the most woefully inept company I have ever had the mispleasure to deal with. You can never get through on their customer service phone number (unless you're prepared to wait about 45-75 mins). You submit queries via their online webforms - they never respond.I for one will never ever use them again and would encourage others to pay that little bit more for your energy in return for a company you can actually contact and who have some semblance of customer services dept!
4756|I know the internet is full of complaints about a lot of providers, but trust me, First Utility are the absolute worst of all. Their customer service is almost invariably unavailable unless you are happy to wait 30/45mins and they DO NOT REPLY TO EMAILS (I know it sounds an absurdity but its the truth). If you are with First Utility I would strongly recommend to change provider sooner rather than later (read: before they take their licence to operate in this country) and triple check your final bills as THEY WILL try to guesstimate your consumption even if you have provided them with meter reads every month. Just to give you an idea, in the last 6 months of operation the complaints to the Ombudsman went from 6k to 20k!FIRST UTILTY AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.
4757|It is virtually impossible to get through on the phone.I have been trying since January to sort out my accountbut they still cannot get their figures correct.Unfortunately cannot transfer until account is clear I amtold.Avoid this company at all costs
4758|I switched my dual fuel account to First Utility in November 2013.  They have efficiently taken direct debit payments monthly since then but I have yet to receive any bill from them at all.  I have no idea if I am over paying or under-paying.  I have sent numerous emails via the contact page on their web-site.  I have queued for hours to speak to somebody only to eventually get an insincere platitude about known problems that we are working on.  How is it possible that an energy company is allowed to trade without having the basic necessity of a viable billing system in place?
4759|I am still waiting for first  :utility to transfer my electricity back to british gas.3 month ago they told me they would return my gas and electic back to British Gas my gas was transfered but not my electric.i have  sent e-mails rang so many times i have lost count, no ones listening.I have never gave a reading,never paid.customer service is really bad they promise to ring back but don't.if you ring you will be on a neverending queue 50,40 if you are lucky 30 people in queue before you.
4760|I. Have been with them over a year now I have never been asked for a meter reading  and the website hasent been updated since February I am going to cancel my payments and go elsewhere after weeks of trying to get in touch with them
4761|Unable to contact anyone over the telephone even when waiting a considerable time after initial  meter reading was incorrect.  It took 5 months for this company to rectify the meter reading.  On closure of the account I requested a final figure to ensure that the account would be clear again, after 3 weeks no response, except for a threatening demand. Although I am a Chartered Engineer I have been unable to understand the continued muddle which was presented  as a statement of my account.  I would be my recommendation not to use this so called company
4762|First Utilities are inefficient and understaffed, consequently it is impossible to get in touch and emails to customer service remain unanswered .They stopped my direct debit  last August when I finally managed to contact them they agreed it would be reinstate. This they have failed to do. I have now been contacted by a debt collecting agency. I spent twenty minutes on hold to day and finally the recorded message advice I should HANG UP!!!!!!! 
4763|The litany of issues I have had with First Utility beggars belief.  Billing issues/DD issues.  I pity the poor sods working in their customer care team - it must feel like being a main contact for the Jimmy Saville Appreciation Society. I stromngly recommend people not to be lured by the prices and tariffs that First Utility offer.  You pay in many more ways.  I can only hope that the Board of Directors at First Utility are bribing OFGEM apprpopriately because I can see no other reason why First Utility should still be in business.  Utter rubbish. 
4764|We transferred over to this company as we hadn't received a bill from our current suppler in over a year. All seemed to go smoothly until we tried to submit a meter reading.  It has now been over 6 months since the transfer and still we are unable to submit the readings and mot received a bill.  I have rung on numerous occasions and been on hold for over half an hour each time.  The representative always say they will sent an email to the appropriate department to get the matter resolved but nothing has been done.  We have emailed our concerns to the complaints department and still nothing has been done.  We are at the end of our teather and don't know how to get the matter resolved.  For the sake of your sanity, use a different provider!!!
4765|Cannot believe they are still in business. Not collected my DD since July 2013 it is now march 2014. Hardly get bills, maybe two a year if lucky.Cannot get any replies to emails or letters.Go somewhere else there are cheaper and better companies than this.They may be cheap, but so is there customer service.FU, FU.
4766|I believe there is something seriously wrong with the management of this Company which requires official investigation.  They appear to be unable to calculate bills and send out - nothing has been update since January 2014 on line.  If you call you could be 20.21st in the queue.  When you get through the answers are not sufficient to solve the problem.  I changed to Variable Direct Debit as I was GBP500 in credit.  Now they cannot tell me how much to pay and there is no likelihood of being able to for another month. No wonder people get in to debt.  After a 15 minute call I still have no answer but was promised a call back in half 30 minutes.  Watch this space.
4767|Be prepared to wait an hour before your calls get answered. Be prepared to never get your email messages returned. I left as soon as I joined because they messed up my change over and never responded to my enquiries. Despite cancelling my account they have informed my new provider to transfer back to them. Nightmare! Don't do do it. Its worth paying a bit extra for a better service.
4768|We have not had a bill now since November last year.  We are pensioners and need to monitor our costs so it has been impossible to gauge if we can afford to switch the heating on. We have sent money each month just to ease the shock when they finally get their act together.  This is very distressing.  Their customer service department and communication options are all poor.   Don't know who to turn to or what to do next.  I feel that if we try to switch we could head towards even more hassle and stress.
4769|Mistake made with meter reading in December; still not fixed# despite an email saying it was.Have written 11 emails and left numerous messages over 2 months.  Not a single response.Phone calls just ring and ring.  After 2hrs 34mins I gave up waiting.I will change to some other supplier at the first opportunity.
4770|Called to ask advice Re. Switching suppliers, was on hold for 53 mins, at a cost to me of GBP5.53 ! Obviously will not be switching will be staying with my present supplier who uses a 0800 number thankfully!
4771|AFTER ALL THE BAD EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAD. THEY PROMISED TO REFUND IN 7-10 WORKING DAYS FROM 5-02-2014 TO DATE STILL NOT SORTED.SENDING WRONG BILLS,PROMISED COMPENSATION,REFUND OF OVERCHARGING.ITS BEEN ONE MONTH TODAY AND STILL NOT SORTED WHEN ON 5-02-2014 THEY SAID ALL WAS SORTED.
4772|I have been with First Utility for three months (was switched to them automatically on moving house). They send me letters addressed to `Mr Owner Occupier', chase me for money that I have already paid them, and ignore letters of complaint. They are impossible to get in touch with on the phone (always No. 40 or more in the queue when I try); now they are threatening me with monthly `processing fees' if I don't pay again money which I believe I have already paid them (last demand was sent without a bill or acknowledgement of my previous payment). 
4773|Transferred away from them beginning of November. They owe me about GBP150. Can't get the final bill. Can't talk to anyone who can give me answers. They don't reply to email or answer letters. My next step is the Ombudsman Services Energy and OFGEM. Wonder if the Small Claims Court might be an idea? Why do I have to waste my time with these people. They are useless. 
4774|try speaking to someone!!! have been between 28 and 51 in the queue! a joke!
4775|After being hit with repeated price increases I finally used a comparison site to change suppliers. I really wish I had not bothered. First Utility do not have customer service; forget the phone, you will never get through. They do not reply to emails. My tariff has been changed 'To reflect a simpler price structure' i.e. a price increase of over twelve pounds a month. They are not giving the full refund after the government cut costs by GBP50 either. Nothing I do gets a reply, so time to go again. I should have come here and read their reviews rather than just use a comparison site.
4776|be warned don't use this company.Customer service is abysmal virtually non  existent  we were not put on the tariff   we were quoted and after 3months still not had a bill but they keep taking my money every month returning to my old supplier asap these people do not deliver what they promise  I will be contacting Ofcom to complain be ware !!!!!
4777|What on earth is going on at First Utility ?. I requested to transfer my energy account to First Utility in October 2013. It took 3 months to do so. I received no communication in that 3 months barring an email request for further information and confirmation of Direct Debit. I have sent numerous emails requesting further information on how to log on to my account and requesting details of how I proceed with the changeover such as submitting meter readings etc.  I did not receive one reply. I have made numerous phone calls but have only been able to get through to a representative once and on that occasion the computers were down and nothing could be done. I eventually got a reply to an email on 7th January but all it said was sorry  no replies to my queries.I replied to this email, again requesting information on logging on to my account etc. I have today received an email saying sorry to see you go.  I have never requested to 'go' I have just tried to phone to sort this out but 37th in a queue to speak to a representative is unacceptable.British Gas (my previous supplier) sent my Final Bill with meter readings lower than on my previous bill because First Utility supplied false readings (in their favour).The changeover eventually took place on 17th January 2014. (info from British Gas)I have paid 1 Direct Debit to First Utility but I am sure they will obtain a true meter reading when they send me my final bill. I am now without a supplier - what do I do ?
4778|After moving house and entering final meter readings on old address and entering new meter readings on new address I presumed that would be all that was needed. 3 months later and several phone calls in between , each lasting over an hour and never being less than  27 th in the queue, I still haven't spoken any of the customer service personell that can confirm if I am still even a first utility customer. They appear to have not processed my bills since last October !  I  have been lied to on each phone call and told to register now as a new customer, even tho I hadn't any intention of leaving them in the first place. They are the cheapest provider of gas and electricity but  definitely massive compromises are made on the managemement and the worst customer service you are ever going to experience. I have cancelled them now  and await the credit they owe me but I certainly won't hold my breath that I will not have to call them again to find out where my credit payment is. I would not advise anybody to use this company regardless of the savings they think they might make, they really aren't worth the trouble.
4779|First Utility are the worst company of any type it has been my misfortune to deal with, imagine your worst nightmare, this will turn out worse, they only have one department that you can get through to by phone, they will not transferyou to the correct department, they will not let you speak to a manager, they do not answer e-mails, they will not phone you back when they promise a return call, they have not answered my posted letter as yet after 15 days 
4780|Never experienced such terrible customer service  The wait to speak to one of their agents? Never less than 43people in the queue with a minimum of a 40 minute wait.  Agents utterly incompetent or tell blatant lies.  I ended up with threats made from their 'partner' debt collecting agents for an error of First Utilities making.  Nasty, upsetting and un-necessary.  Why does the Ombudsman not come crashing down on these companies to stamp out such behaviour, it's a disgrace.STAY CLEAR OF FIRST UTILITY.  
4781|Immediate service very good but last two months even though the meter readings have been sent in no bills have been sent out or money taken. They have been emailed twice and have never replied. Two phone calls and it took 45 minutes to get a reply on both occasions and they still have not sent a bill!  Initially much cheaper than big six but it seems that that customer service is compromised in order to keep costs low and it does not suggest that they can cope with the demand. My time with them is up and I will not renew even if it costs me more as at least I will know where I am up to with my bills! Be wary of the cheaper option as you get what you pay for!
4782|AVOID FIRST UTILITY LIKE THE PLAGUE - they claim they'll save you money on your tarriff, but when you factor in the cost involved in trying to make contact with them (last time on hold for 1 hour 9 minutes) and they completely ignore your emails so you have no choice but to try and ring,what you would save on your energy bill you more than pay for with your own time, phone bill and sanity.  I'd rather live in a field than have these fools supplying my gas/electricity. Oh and in addition, after 8 months or so they'll contact you to tell you that you owe them money and that if you don't pay it, it'll be forwarded on - so you're then back in the vicious cycle above of not being able to speak to anyone - they managed to churn out their reminder overdue bill letters no problem however.......... are the positive reviews on here made up by first utility themselves???????  
4783|Without doubt the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Transfered to another company SIX months ago FU completely messed up the final bill and yes you've guessed it OVERCHARGED GBP100 Frustration frustration frustration waiting hours on their dreaded telephone call system and met with the most incompetent and inexperienced staff on the planet!! Apologies,promises,excuses one after one after the other still nothing being done virtually abandoned hopeless - give up! KEEP WELL CLEAR IF YOU WANT TO RETAIN YOUR SANITY AND SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. 
4784|Automated phone system is awful - distorted and disjointed. When you get past that expect a long wait - today (7/1/2014) queue is approx 80 and yesterday it was 107 and took and hour.Maybe cheap, but seems the customer service is also cheap.
4785|Wedid not start well with this company as they messed up our first bill, not down to previous supplier. Have only been with them for a year but they messed up another bill by double counting the meter readings! Have tried to contact them by phone, 1hr wait if you are prepared to pay for expensive phone call. Thus Emailed them instead, after three weeks they gave me a credit note with no hint of an appology just a number of warning letters for not paing my bill, cheeky lot. Awful experience with their customer services. Their cut price fuel is not worth the extra effort to check and correct their billing, hence we have move to Co-Op energy, see how that goes!
4786|The customer service for First Utility leaves a lot to be desired.  After phoning first utility to change my Direct Debit to another bank, they failed to set up the new DD, then they try to charge you for there mistake.Although a large amount in credit they have now increased my DD against my wishes.  My contract is up in March, so I will be looking for a supplier with better customer service.
4787|If you want to suffer then go this energy supplier, stay away, the worst customer service. They only care for new customers, once they get you, they will not want to know you, Customer Service really terrible, you will be talking to someone who has been about a month in customer service, who knows no head or tail. He will shove you to diff customer service if he cant take the heat of any complain.
4788|Avoid, avoid, avoid...... I have sent F-U two moving home notifications, a final gas and electric meter reading notification, a few comment emails to customer service (if you can call them that) a complaint form via their website and an email from my personnel account complaining why I have heard nothing and guess what I have had off them?A computer generated reply saying they are sorry I have a complaint and a computer generated reply saying they will now bill me monthly as they have been notified by my bank that I have cancelled my direct debit.I cannot get through to them by any means, 53 minutes left on hold last week on the phone and I am calling them from Spain as I am here until March. Nobody replies to your emails and nobody picks up the phone, ever. They have GBP322.00 of my money sitting in their account and I cannot get through to anyone to try and get it back. I have given them until today, 18/12/13 to get back to me before I take matters further. I may consider the small claims court as the Ombudsman scheme is useless anyway. I will also be putting in a claim for costs through the courts, these companies need to be closed down as they are not meeting any customer demands at all. Just so frustrating to deal with it is untrue, I definitely know which company I will not ever deal with again so at least that's one plus point to finish on. 
4789|Switched to a competitor which appeared to offer better value effective 29th October 2013. Up to that point First Utility had been fine. My October 21st invoice showed a credit balance of GBP247 most of which I assumed would be returned. On 28th October (just as my scheduled switch away was about to take place) they took a further GBP130 by direct debit (careless of me not to cancel it - be warned). My usage between 21st and 29th October would have been modest. So they hold over GBP300 of my money but despite reminders have not refunded it. Poor form.  Leaves a sour taste. My recommendation is to deal instead with firms that treat customers properly. 
4790|"The switchover to First Utility has been a nightmare. Joined by comparison site and quoted GBP34 a month for dual fuel (single occupant, one bedroom flat). They have not given me a start date or asked for my meter readings, yet they seem happy to attempt to take at least GBP94 a month via direct debit. I question the amount but they make excuses such as ""it's based on an average."" Then they claim they can't do GBP34 a month as it is GBP50 a month direct debit minimum. Nothing in their terms and conditions about that, highly misleading. Speaking to customer service is an ordeal, assuming I get connected that is. Sent written complaints, but nothing is being answered. They claim that if a payment is in dispute, they won't take the direct debit. Good job I cancelled, as they did attempt to take payment. Here's the best bit - I apparently have two direct debits, both at GBP94, but no-one has explained why I have two accounts, just that there should be one direct debit. Asked my ""supplier"" to requote and they gave me a deal worth taking. More than what I was paying them at the point of leaving originally, but worth taking considering this hassle. First Utility have yet to acknowledge that I have left. Disgraceful company."
4791|"The ""Distance Selling regulation"" Rules appear flouted in my case. I applied to join F/U on 30th October, then read some online reviews which caused me to have second thoughts and change my mind regarding joining, so two days later I formally Cancelled my Request on 01st November (well within the legal 7 day cooling off period)... I fully followed First Utility processes to cancel, even sending a separate email to Cust Services requesting confirmation that my enquiry had been cancelled and asking to remove all my details, to which they replied stating everything was cancelled and my details wiped and confirming my exit. Now four weeks later on the 28th November, it subsequently emerges that First utility had disingenuously taken-over my supply, setting up the direct debit, contacting my last supplier etc.. they also have the audacity to now refuse the transfer of my electricity supply over to my prefered new supplier (SSE) ~ First Utility now send notice requesting my first meter readings, and explaining how my transfer is progressing nicely blah blah blah!. My personal experience of trying to telephone this company and getting my situation resolved has been truly dreadful, getting through to somebody has always taken around 35/40 minutes, and when one does speak to a representative, you find you're either not understood, the person appears not able to deal with your request, or the call needs to be transferred to the 'correct department' thus having to reque for another 30/40 minutes, or end up being put on hold for 10/15 minutes while 'they investigate' only to be told ""sorry, there was a glitch in the system"" but everything has now been sorted! ~ I have discovered anything they say, do, or promise should NEVER be relied upon!. My troubles with this supplier are still ongoing, new emails inform me I shall now be billed monthly and am required to pay bills in cash since I contacted my bank to cancel the Direct Debit mandate. I honestly regret making contact with this Company....it always leaves one with a sinking feeling when any online Company shatters your trust!.... yet I am glad and somewhat relieved that I had the foresight to cancel my application within 2 days of signing up... even though their Computer System blatantly ignored my legal request to cancel, I feel First Utility has been given the opportunity to rectify my situation in a satisfactory way on numerous occasions ... yet had they acted professionally once first contacted I would not have needed to write this unfavourable review. From reading other online reviews, this ignoring requests to cancel appears to be a somewhat regular recurring situation experienced by others too. ~ So a formal complaint to the regulator may be required. ~'First Utility'.... more like the 'LAST UTILITY' I shall be using... Remember!... once they take hold you can't get rid of them that easily! "
4792|It is impossible to get through on the phone, I spent 40 mins on hold costing me a bomb. Emails are never answered and they have upped my monthly payments because they didn't take monthly direct debits when they should have done, cannot wait until my fixed period is up and I can move to another supplier.
4793|This firms customer service is very poor and frustrating.  I have tried to contact First Utility for the past month via phone or email.  They never answer the telephone or their emails.  They have upped my payments from GBP83 to GBP130 per month with no explanation.  It is impossible to speak to anyone regarding this matter.  There is no customer care involved they are happy to take your money but offer no after care at all.  I am totally frustrated and angry.  I feel like changing my power suppliers but this costs if you move within the first 12 months.  They have got you in a no win situation. 
4794|My bills at always lower than when i was with British gas and I get 10%money back every year. (Don't know if they still do that BTW) Never had any major issues and only heard people winge about customer services. Get out of the big six and no fee for leaving first utility if you get fed up of them 
4795|First utility are a nightmare. Have had a number of issues with them in the year we have been with them. The most recent issue  was caused when they demanded that we have smart meter installed. This was duly done at the end of September. Thankfully, I took a meter reading when the engineer came to install as a little over a month later we had a bill for over GBP202 for less than one months usage. Our average for both gas and electricity is around. GBP80.  It's quite clear that the  error is based on the meter reading taken from by the engineer and it is clear to see from all of our previous bills that the usage presented in the bill was incorrect. We contacted first utility and finally got through to an advisor after four calls and a number of emails, none of which were responded to. Once we actually got through to someone he agreed that the meter reading was clearly incorrect and we provided with the meter reading we took. He promised he would arrange for a revised bill to be sent out within the week. This was due two weeks ago and this was still into received. We did in the meantime have an email from them saying the meter reading had been revised but still not bill. So we chased it up, again with customer services and still nothing.That is until today when we received the next bill. Hoping that all issues were resolved in this bill, we were soon disappointed. The error filled bill from October still remains on our account and is now joined by a monthly usage consistent (at least) with our average usage.One is not amused! Needless to say, we can't get through to anyone at customer services- question sometimes if anyone is actually there. Have emailed them again today as well but doubt will receive a response based on their previous lack of acknowledge,nets.All we want to do is pay our bill! be honest are disgusted with their customers services or lack of. We have also had lots of issues with not receiving any bills and strange bills being added to our account online, one of which which even showed we were GBP1300 in credit! Needless to say we did not receive this either and only realised we have 4 random bills on our account from September when we started investigating the fine mess they seems to have placed us in with the bills.As soon as someone actually calls us to address is issue which should have already been resolved, we will be leaving first utility at the first opportunity! 
4796|I complained to the ombudsman about how bad they are. I am waiting to see what the ombudsman will do. I moved out of the previous address on the 30th june and promptly informed the company of my move and intention to close the account. They continued to take GBP100 per month out of my bank account everymonth. So far GBP500 has been taken. I complained on the 17th september about this through their online messaging system and I got a reply confirming that My Account was in credit and they will refund and close my direct debit. This has never happened and they direct debit remained active. After multiple further complaints (some of which were not answered), they said that they will send me a cheque. I find it strange why they should send a cheque while they can just pay the money back into the bank. This was the only reason why I kept the direct debit open. Anyway, I got a cheque in the post today for GBP200 exactly. Clearly I am overcharged more GBP500 but they picked this GBP200 out of thin air treating me like an idiot. I am very concerned with this behaviour which is pretty much fraud. Imagine if I was a vulnerable customer who never noticed the discrepancy. Firstutility would have just pocketed the money. The cheque had no apology attached. There was no explanation of how they arrived at this amount. This is extremely rude and inconsiderate. I believe I am Owed the following. Overpayment: GBP465.74 Interest : GBP10 Admin charges: GBP210 (7 complaints at GBP30 each) Compensation for the trouble: GBP200 Total Owed by First Utility: GBP885.74 I would be grateful if you could sort this out for me. Many thanks,
4797|I received a letter from First Utility informing me that I had to have a new electric meter fitted as was required after ten years and they would install a smart meter at the same time. The first thing the installer did was check for a signal and guess what there was none even though every mobile phone imaginable works perfectly well with no signal problems, the installer eventually admitted this is a ploy to gain entry to your property to fit the new electric meter only I`m just waiting to see how THEY benefit from the new meter. 
4798|This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. I joined them about a year ago and have had nothing but pain.They can't produce a bill from their system, but are able to keep taking money from me every month.My meter was replaced April 2013, which they have still not been able to update on their online systems.Lots of emails and phone calls but they just seemed not to be bothered to fix anything. I have had various excuses ranging from back office processes and IT system failures. I could have implemented new processes and systems for them in the time I have been waiting for them to fix issues.The Board and Management team needs to stop wasting time advising the Government and ofgem, or criticising the big 6; they need to spend time looking at their own organisation and fix the mess it's in. If I was on the Board, a few senior heads would have rolled by now. 
4799|JOINED FIRST UTILITY IN JUNE. PREVIOUS SUPPLIER (NPOWER)COULD NOT AGREE MY FINAL READING FOR A LONG TIME DESPITE FREQUENT CALLS.GOT AN ONLINE BILL ON 12TH JULY FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET ONE SINCE. I HAVE EMAILED AND RECEIVED HOLDING MESSAGES PROMISING AN ANSWER BUT NO ANSWER.TRIED CALLING THEM 30TH OCT. WAITED 32 MINUTES, WHEN AN OPERATOR EVENTUALLY ANSWERED, SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT HEAR ME AND PUT THE PHONE DOWN!THEIR WEB SITE HAS A LIST OF NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO WILL HELP WITH PROBLEMS, BUT NO CONTACT NUMBERS!!!I HAVE GIVEN THEM 7 DAYS TO REPLY TO MY LATEST CONTACT EMAIL, BEFORE I REPORT THEM TO OFGEM --- NOT THAT THAT WILL HELP MUCH!!   
4800|My last meter reading was sent on 25th September and today 21 Oct there is no sign of a bill . I pay by fixed Direct Debit and three months ago my account was in debit after the winter period . They said that I need to make a payment in addition to the sgreed figure as they cannot allow an account to carry on with a debit . They simply were unable to grasp the concept of more usage  in the winter and less in the summer averaging out over the year . at one point the guy suddenly said right I am going to change you to a variable debit so that the debit balance will be paid off . Sticking to my guns I argued my case and after the guy talked to his manager they agreed to leave the direct debit alone but would put my account on watch (whatever that means ). Some while later  I took a call from another guy who calmly announced that my account was in credit and that I would build up some more credit in the next few summer months  to set against the winter higher usage .
4801|"Do not consider this company if you enjoy sleeping at night. Due to their incompetence and total lack of customer care, for the first time in 33 years I have a debt to a utility company. Shortly after I joined them in 2009 my electricity meter stopped working. It took them 5 months to replace and a further 18 months to bill me for the electricity they say I used. In the meantime they collected and refunded wildly differing amounts that have left me in the red to the tune of GBP900 +. This has been going on for four years and even though I have arranged to repay the outstanding amount on a monthly basis they have refused to allow me to switch to a more efficient customer orientated company. First Utility or ""Worst Utility"" as it is better known are the utility company from Hell and should be avoided at all costs! "
4802|I would never recommend them to anyone, They don't seem to want to take their money as they never go in to my bank account for it even though a D/D is set up, they keep saying they have problems with it and this just leaves me with a growing bill, they are also still billing the previous occupier for the same period of time, in other words sending out two identical bills for the same gas usage. I got fed up with it in the end and six months ago I switched suppliers to EON and have now saved myself an estimated GBP300 a year, only problem is that I still have First Utility billing me for both gas and electricity although they are no longer my supplier.
4803|Had an issue with a bill with them since June, and still cannot get it sorted out, I send reams of emails with lots of details about the problem, but it seems no-one really reads them or gives a damn. I still have not got sorted out and have now had to contact Ombudsman ~Services. they are trying to charge me GBP800 for gas and elec over the summer months from end of feb to beg of aug, even though the house was left empty for 4 of those months, and they just won't budge on the price, in fact they have increased it by GBP100 and said they need to charge me again from aug to sep now!I would definitely not recommend them.
4804|They are simply unable of doing a correct bill.In my case it got worse because I had a prepayment meter that they had to change. That confused the hell of them, even if I explained them the problems every single time they did a mistake. They always answer saying sorry, and that they will fix the problem, but they never do.Recently I got billed GBP370 because they were counting *THREE* different gas meters when I obviously only have one.
4805|I closed the account due to a move and they first botched closing the account, then sending the final bill, then sending the refund... Resolution centre has you talking to lovely and polite people but nothing gets done. Everywhere you look they are having egregious reviews yet when you go on their site, customer reviews are great...albeit using the same jargon they use in their marketing so no brainier that they are faked. This company should be closed down by the government. I am taking them to small claims court bypassing the regulator and claiming the interest on what they owe me. Worst company ever. 
4806|"The fact that they take a minimum of 20 minutes to answer your calls is just the start.  I am a combined gas and electricity customer of First Utility.Since I switch to First Utility 11 months ago they have ignored every single meter reading I have made because they have been ""outside industry standards"".  Basically I don't use enough gas or electricity so they inflate my readings and put through their own estimate!  I did manage to get a refund back in January but since then I have been fighting to get them to accept my readings.  First Utility in their wisdom decided that as my readings were so low that I must have a faulty gas meter.  That was fine, at least they could see that my reading was accurate as you do feel like they are accusing you of faking the readings but then the really big problem arose.  On my next bill,  June 2013 they combined the previous bill reading using my old meter with the reading with my new meter and came up with a huge bill.  I rang yet again and got through to someone who was really understanding understood the problem and would make the corrections and update the bill. I received the credit note which was then ignored on the next bill and the wrong readings were back on my bill!!!  Whatever you do avoid this bunch like the plague.  "
4807|We joined first utility last year and are on a fixed price till march.  Our bills are over GBP40 a month cheaper with them which is a decent saving and their good point. However bills are their downfall. Some bills arrive 4 weeks later than specified. They recently sent an email saying they were changing their billing system and now readings had to be done on the21st of a month a bills will be ready the next day. Well it's now the 1oth of the following month and I still can't get the bill. Very annoying.
4808|First Utility seemed OK at first then hit me with an 18% rise , I changed company's .I finished with FU on 31st May they took a further payment on June 15th two weeks after the contract ended even though we had ample credit to settle all bills , we are GBP300 in cr5edit yet getting it back is a nightmare. Customer Relations promise to repay it in seven days , time after time we have been promised this.It appears the customer services staff are told to lie to customers.It is now September 3rd still no sign of the refund , we are at a loss what to do ,paying our new supplier and yet GBP300 in limbo somewhere in the coffers of this cheating company.Keep away at all costs , you will be sorry if you use these as your supplier. 
4809|Don't use this company, I transferred to another supplier 2months ago and sent them the final readings but received no final bill until a week after the usual date and after the had taken the usual direct debit. The bill included extra estimated energy usage. I queried this but got no reply and this month they took another payment, an immediate phone call got a promise of a refund of all money owed (GBP238)by BACS to my bank account. All that materialised was a statement of annual usage and mail saying because I had cancelled the direct debit I would have to pay mail ash monthly. My next email got the response that they would send a cheque as they don't have my bank details. Incidentally,they took their first payment several days before they actually started supplying me,bit of a liberty,pity they're not as good at parting with money as they are at taking it.
4810|Hi, Their customer service has been good when I've needed to contact them, they are currently our cheapest optionalthough...bills are irregular (i.e. one might be dated the 7th of the month, the next dated the 19th of the month) making them harder to understand useage,requests for meter readings are irregular (sometimes I'm sure they ask every couple  of weeks, meaning I often ignore them, also meaning-though my own fault-that most bills are estimated),if you're always hugely in credit unlike other companies, they don't automatically offer to adjust your direct debit, you have to request this yourselfsometimes when you try to submit a meter reading online it wont let you (this has happened a few times)occasionally your account says you have no bills (so you have to search through your emails to find them)after we first joined it was a few months before we got any bills at all, we only got one once I'd requested it.
4811|I moved into a house supplied by them and contacted them in order to take the supply over.  8 weeks later I had received no correspondence from them nor had they set up a direct debit as I had requested.  My old supplier had contacted me asking if I would like them to take over the supply so I agreed however First Utility refused to transfer the electricity and after several long phonecalls it turned out to be their error setting up the account in the first place.  So now over 12 weeks in my new home I still have had no correspondence from First Utility and it looks like they have eventually allowed EON to take over both my gas and electricity.  All in all very poor customer service.
4812|Ive been with FU since Sept 2010 when I moved into my apartment the smart meters were already in place so had no choice to stay with them and after being told these were the cheapest company around a didn't feel the need to switch.  What a mistake this was my first bill arrived in at over GBP150 I obviously queried this and was told it would be looked into this was not next month another bill came coming in even higher I rang again and was told an engineer will come and look at the smart meter they did but the bills were never looked into I paid the outstanding balance as I was told I would be reimbursed this did not happen and over priced billing continued this has been ongoing since then I've sent in complaint after complaint rang and possibly spoke to every customer service advisor going. I've provided all meter reading when asked and have been cooperative the company however have not ive just been on hold for 30 min to inquire as to why GBP600 has been slapped onto my electricity account this company is appalling  and has the worst possible customer service I've ever come across!  Maybe one day in the distant future I can report back and say it's sorted but after over 2 years I've lost all hope in that!!
4813|"In December of 2012 I returned from holiday to find that my gas meter had gone wrong - it was counting up units even with the gas disconnected.  I reported this to First Utility who said that someone would call and check the meter.  No-one arrived!In January, I received a bill for GBP750 for 1 month's gas (for the month that we were on holiday).  I called FU once again and asked them to explain why no-one had yet called to inspect the meter.  They said someone had but we were out.  I asked what date that had occurred because we have someone at the house most of the time.  They could not provide the date.  Later that day, the meter company did call to make an appointment and I asked when they had visited previously.  They confirmed that they had not called and the first time that they heard about the problem was today.  Someone was not telling the truth and I tend to think that the meter company was quite straight.The meter man arrived two weeks later and removed the meter.  It still clocked up units when removed from the supply.A month went by and I had still not heard anything from FU so I contacted them again.This time they said that they had no record of my having reported a meter problem.  I stopped all payments on my direct debit.Another month went by and I received the report form the meter company saying that the meter was at fault and beyond being testable.  I contacted FU again but they again stated that I had not reported a meter fault.I then used their so called ""complaint procedure' and surprisingly they found my previous correspondence.  They assured me that their accounts would be in touch with me to discus what the amount outstanding should actually be and to reach an agreement.  No-ne called!It is now 6 months since the problem started and I have just received a small credit to my account (without anyone calling).  The credit is a fraction of the overcharge.I have just heard the Managing Director on the television who explains that there are only about 80 customers who have had a problem with their customer services!  Anyone who thinks that they have a problem should email him directly - THATS GOOD.  So I have looked for his email address but the only contact is via (you've guessed it - Customer Services).  I asked Customer Services for their MD's email address and await their reply - what are the chances that they will reply I wonder.As soon as this matter is resolved, I will change suppliers.  Good customer service is worth paying a few extra pounds for.  My advice to anyone looking for a utility supplier is to stay well clear of First Utility."
4814|Whatever you do, do not switch or be tempted by FU's cheap tariffs.  These are truly the most appalling company I have ever dealt with.  Currently I am on hold waiting to speak to customer services, I have been waiting now for 58 minutes.  I moved out of my home over a month ago and have rang FU numerous times asking for my final bill.  They said the landlady rang up and reinstated me as the tenant without even speaking to me!!! So I have asked again for a final bill but I have received an estimated bill for this month.  Probably the most incompetent, useless customer service I have ever experienced.  I have sent emails that they do not respond to and OFGEM seriously need to look at investigating the practices of this company.  Thats it, in queue over 1 hour, ridiculous.  I await debt collectors.
4815|I joined First Utility through the Go Compare webite with a GBP40 cash back offer. From day one they have been terrible.  They seem incapable of setting up the right amount of direct debit and trying to get through to their customer services is a joke as it always takes 15 to 20 mins to get through and then you are told something different each time and there is never any record of previous calls. My biggest issue is trying to get the GBP40 cash back offer from them. At first they said it had nothing to do with them and it was Go Compare who paid it! Then they said it's paid after 3 months supply even though their own emails are stating 30 days! I am now in a battle with their complaints department who point blank refuse to even acknowledge what their own emails state. I am also writing to the Ombudsman in the hope they can help as I'm getting no where. I will be moving from First Utility at the earliest opportunity!!
4816|I searched for reviews on First Utility as I had a very large amount taken our of my account with no notice (I pay by Direct Debit). I was really concerened, Having read the reviews I expected to have a real battle on my hands and end up being ignored, but I found the complete opposite.It took a while to get through on the phone, but no longer than with other companies. The people I spoke to couldn't have been nicer or more helpful,The issue was resolved on the spot.You couldn't ask for more. Added to the fact that this is the first instance I have had for concern in the few years I have been with them - top marks from me.
4817|Awful from day 1 of transfer! Direct debit set up failure, estimates used when meter reads issued, threatening demands for monies owed, debt collector threats, C Services take approx 40 mins to answer telephones, inadequate & incorrect information provided, constant emails, texts & letters demanding money, then when I finally got through to settle final bills (I had requested a transfer to another company) I pay in full to receive a letter saying I still owed full amount paid! Now I have an email stating that I have paid but owe GBP2.10!!! They will not be getting this, I have wasted numerous sums of money trying to contact this incompetent, unprofessional company. Never again can I place myself through such stressful times! I do not recommend!!!!!!!!!! This company should not be trading
4818|"Overall not too bad, but then all I do is send them my readings every month and they send the bill and take the payment by direct debit.  However, trying to get my discount payment from them is like trying to get blood from a stone.  All through the year they put on the bottom of the bill that the payment will be made within 28 days of the March bill.  March bill arrives and it has suddenly changed to being sent out ""the following month"".  We are now at the 7th May and still no sign.  Called in the middle of April and was told it was being sent the following week.  Tried to call again last week but gave up after 20 mins of holding.  Sent 2 e-mails that have not been answered.  Once I get my cheque I will be saying goodbye!!"
4819|since I joined first utility they have NEVER drawn successfully the d/d payment from my bankI continually have to pay manually NOW I have had enoughand am leaving for another provider as there admin is sodisgustingly bad THEY CONTINUALLLY SEND ME EMAILS THAT CONTRADICTTHE LAST ONE e.g one day its NO Monies are due next day URGENT ACTIONWILL BE TAKEN IF BILL NOT PAIDSTAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY TRULY AWFUL
4820|Having been with most of the other providers and now been with First Utility for 3 years I am not sure i would ever go back.  Customer Service has been first rate, billing has been flawless and meter reading submission has been very easy.  Just got a whole lot easier now that we have a smart reader too.  The other providers look so dated by comparison.
4821|After I submitted my initial meter reading to First Utility, they then submitted completely false ones to my former supplier, EDF. I'm not sure of the reason for this but I suspect it involves them making more money somehow. Anyway, alarm bells were ringing straight away. Shortly afterwards, I noticed that my direct debit date was the 17th of the month...and like most people I get paid at the end of the month so asked this to be changed to the 28th. I received confirmation of this from a customer services agent called Jennie via email stating, 'Having reviewed your account, I can confirm that your payment date is the 28th of the month and will remain so going forward' (only Jennie's English and grammar weren't so good). Guess what happened on the 17th? Yes, the direct debit came out causing me to become overdrawn in an unauthorised capacity, incurring charges on my bank account. I was put on hold for over twenty minutes when I called them and then simply told to calim it back via my bank. I have so far not heard anything regarding a refund of my bank charges, and the number of people I spoke to who simply wanted me off the line and transferred me elsewhere...and I am not aggressive and was ever so polite on the phone...is just unacceptable.It's shocking to think I signed up with this company based on Money Saving Expert telling me their tariffs were the best. I would genuinely rather pay more to not have to deal with these clowns any more. I will always read reviews before signing up in the future, regardless of what 'money saving' experts tell me. I actually think I'll be worse off once you take into account all the costs for phonecalls, being overdrawn, and the time I've wasted emailing back and forth.I suggest this company is avoided by everyone, I can't stress that enough.
4822|Send your meter readings in at the end of the month,they send you a reminder by e-mail
4823|I joined in December 2012 and from the start they messed up my meter readings than overcharged me over GBP500 because they billed me imperial for gas when I am metric and it took over a month to get my money back .. Don't bother with their emai service as they just lie constantly. There is an absolute lack of communication and I am just glad I got out of there and gone back to British gas. First utility may be cheaper but it is not worth the stress and hassle.
4824|Unfortunately while using a comparison site first utility was recommended. In nov 2012 I attempted to switch my gas and electricity to first utility. Four months later they had managed to transfer my electricity but not my gas, however they and my old provider both were charging me for gas. In march 2013 I moved and cancelled my service. In April 2013 despite my account being cancelled they still took a direct debit and now owe me just on GBP400. I am still waiting on a final bill which I need to confirm is correct before they will release my money. First utilities processes seem to be set on getting as much money from you in direct debits while making it difficult to reclaim any owed monies. In review of my current bills they are higher than my old provider so I would suggest you need to check any recommendations from comparison sites thoroughly before switching to first utility as I do not believe they are cheaper.
4825|I would not suggest that anyone goes to First Utility. I have sent 2 direct debit mandates and received confirmation of receipt and been assured the DD was set up at least 3 times.  Now I have yet another e-mail saying direct debit has been cancelled and when I speak via live chat (debateable if alive) I am told no bank details on account.Last bill was for GBP97, I made payment of GBP65 by card. Online account 
4826|With them for 3 years so far so good but don't try to leave! We moved 30/11/12 tried to give a reading and pay by both phone and email but was told had to leave direct debit open as it wasn't a convenient date for them, I don't think so! Kept on trying but customer service is useless we must have spoken to everyone that works there! First we owed nothing, then GBP8 now it has jumped to over GBP400. During this we have had welcoming letters, even though we have left!! Now we have debt collectors calling and we are at our wits end. It is now with Citizens Advice and I have contacted the energy ombudsman. Why has this company not been investigated and held to account? 
4827|I joined First Utility about 3 years ago after reading they are cheaper than the better known providers. I am extremely happy with the service provided. I used to have to read my gas and electricity meters monthly but soon had a smart meter fitted free of charge. The bills are cheaper. I guess the other reviews reflect poor customer service but I have never had cause to deal with customer service thankfully. 
4828| for over 4 years I have suffered with this incompetent lot. Where do I start oh yes the inability to submit a meter read for over a year a year trying to pay, the energy ombudsman, full support for my complaint with compensation, First Utility ignore judgement, another year of getting nowhere endless e mails and long waits on phonePayment plans stuck to but still threatening e mails and letters and a fight to get 2 annual discount rebatesI have today paid the final bill having switched to Sainsburys , this after another threatening e mail saying I was overdue despite not receiving an e mail notice for the invoice.I have paid exactly one penny too much so that should hopefully cause minor chaosAnd al I wanted to do was pay what I owedThey are to good service what bush was to world peace
4829|I occupied a flat where FU were the electricity supplier. At the end of my occupancy I provided a closing meter reading and my new contact details.I heard nothing for 18 months when I was contacted by a debt collector. The debt collector was unable to provide an FU bill to support the amount FU claimed was owing.2 months later I was contacted by another debt collector who was also unable to provide an FU bill. Finally in January 2013 I was contacted by a third debt collector who provided 3 bills! None of them made sense with balances carried forward that did not match previous balances.I complained vigorously to FU who have now decided to write off the amount.All in all a completed shambles with debt collectors being employed to cover administrative inefficiencies. 
4830|Do not go to FU it would be less painful to light a fire with kerosene in your living room. I had a gas meter fitted in June 2012 and they didnt re set my readings to zero so all my bills have been out of Sync.It took me months to get my first discount cheque.They actually Lie to you on the phone and E mail and I have proof.DO NOT USE THEMWhat is the point of OFGEM when these people are obviously bending the rules
4831|FIRST UTILITYI have the misfortune of being locked into this company now due to a duel fuel price fix.They gave put my bill up by GBP20 and I wanted to question this.I rang the number, held on for 10 mins and was put through to a 'overflow' centre. When I asked what this was it is apparently a centre where they take your call but cannot help you, only telling you somebody 'should ring you back' within 48 hrs?? I tried again the next morning and got through to the most arrogant customer operator ever.  He preceded to tell me ' only GBP20' and then requested that I show him some courtesy. In the end he sent me a form to complete which is very intrusive asking about all your financial commitments just so they can look into reducing your bill.  This I have never heard of before maybe it's a new thing but I had no problems when with EDF for 5 years, unfortunately I decided to change to a better fuel offer and I wish I hadn't. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!
4832|At the beginning of November you informed me by letter that you would be transfering my supply from Spark Energy in the week starting 26th November and YOU SET UP A DIRECT DEBIT, taking two payments in November and December. No one from your company contacted me to provide an electrictity and gas meter readings at that time but I emailed you about them. I have just checked online my account on your website that there is an information that I have NO ACTIVE SERVICES WITH YOU? DID NOT YOU TRANSFER MY SUPPLY AT THE END OF NOVEMBER? WHY DID YOU COLLECT THE MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT ON TWO OCCASIONS THEN? Furthermore I have received emails that you are starting again transfering the an electrictity and gas supply to you company? Another cooling period has ended? I did have one in October or November. PLEASE RETURN IMMEDIATELY THE MONEY YOU HAVE TAKEN FROM MY ACCOUNT. That is shocking experience I got from you and be sure that I am going to share it on a public forum! I am going to sue you for a difference in charges between Spark Energy and your online tariff (that I chose) starting from the day you were supposed to transfer your supply and YOU DID NOT.
4833|worst customer service everlies lies and more lies from this companyincompetance as standardcheques promised - not arrived in over 50 days - dont bank on your dual fuel discounttake any amount of direct debit that they want - as much as 243 a month for 3 bed house!!!!Call backs NEVER happenPlease dont be as stupid as I was and read the reviews first before you get involved with this company
4834|This is just to say that today I received my dual fuel discount cheq for 157.44 and I am delighted. In the days of negative reviews etc I just thought it right that I say I am very happy with 1st Utility having been with them for just over 12 months and with me reading my meters every month I know I am only paying for what I use so this refund is an added bonus. Thank you 1st Utility 
4835|Please, please do NOT give this company your slightest consideration.I have been with them for around 3 years now on dual fuel and joined them because I wanted to end estimated billing and just pay for what I have used. It took them 18 months to get my smart meters fitted and working properly so was on estimated bills during that period! That was when their contractor eventually fitted the correct meters and my wife having to have 3 separate days off work waiting for the engineers to arrive.When you do complain, you get an automated response from them saying they will look at the complaint within two days. Then you usually get a load of waffle back written by someone who hasn't got a clue whats going on.For example. I havent been checking, my bills. My fault you may say, but I am on 'smart metering', surely it should always be right as it transmits data to First Utility every 30 minutes.This month I did check my bill and found it to be over GBP600. I nearly collapsed. It transpired, they had not charged me in January, but credited my account. But two weeks later they want it back plus what I owe them, and tell me it is overdue. Bear in mind I am on direct debit. This left over GBP300 which was taken yesterday the 14th Feb, and now have another bill for GBP198 which is being taken on the 20th Feb! Absolutely useless.
4836|I have two problems with First Utility:1. The estimates applied to bills are always more than double what they should be. If you fail to provide a meter reading one month you will be guaranteed a bill double what it should be. If you provide a meter reading before the last day of the month, expect the remaining days to be estimated at around 4x the average rate for the period for which you have provided a reading. They are clearly using customers money to boost cash flow.2. They regularly restructure pricing schemes such that exist customers will be left on very expensive tariffs; the names of which are confusingly similar and not all listed on their comparison tool making it difficult to tell the extent to which you are being ripped off. I estimate this cost me in excess of GBP500.
4837|As with many people, I have experienced truly pathetic attempts at 'customer service' from First Utility. I am in the process of desperately trying to get shot of them but can't get them to calculate my final bill. Have resorted to complaining to the energy ombudsman to try and resolve. Please avoid to save your sanity! 
4838|can't imagine a poorer customer service. long wait on hold for customer service (allow minimum 20 mins on a good day) constant errors in bill both for meter readings and tarriff which are always excessive and in their favour.Had four incorrect bills and wrote numerous letters pointing out errors which are not corrected by the next bill or even the one after. Company is a complete waste of space, gives nothing but grief. Would rate them -5 if possible.
4839|"I used First utility for over two years, making the mistake of not cancelling the moment my dual fuel discount was credited (at the end of the contract year). In September, they suddenly decided to ""rebill"" for a lengthy period without any reason or logic, as I have provided meter readings every month. Funnily, the rebilled amount they mysteriously decided to charge me, was nearly exactly the amount I got credited for the dual fuel discount. As the meter readings were correct and up to date, I'm still mystified as to why I was suddenly charged an additional GBP289. In December, I finally got an apologetic email stating that there had been mistake and some amounts would be credited to my account. Firstly, those amounts didn't really make any sense as they were different from the disputed amounts, but secondly (and more importantly) to this date nothing has been credited to my account and when my final invoice since moving at the end of October arrived today, the disputed amount was still stated as outstanding. I've been on the phone to them for hours and hours, sent endless emails etc etc, all to no avail. "
4840|In Oct 2012 I was looking at all my bills using Uswitch for my energy bills this company come up, all looked good saving GBP270 a year. After a few weeks the emails came saying which date I was switching, then I got an email saying they were going to take the first Direct Debit on the day I switched, I wanted to query this as I still had the NPower bill to pay. Being November and now looking at having to pay two energy bills the month before Christmas.I tried to get through to First Utility. This is when the fun started. Tried phoning a few times but hung up after 1/2 hr as this is a not a free phone line, sent a few emails. Finally got an email back after chasing the first one, but they did not understand my problem or answer my question. Rung one evening got through on the phone, they said their system was down and they would ring me back...guess what they didn't.  Still have not had any answers to my questions so this weekend I went back to NPOWER and asked them to switch me back. They offer me a slight more expensive contract but at least I can talk to them if I have any issues. I know that first utility will try charge me GBP60 for leaving the contract and this has been a very expensive lesson 'read reviews of the company before you switch'.  
4841|Do not go near this company as they are impossible to get hold of and some of the estimates for bills are unbelievable. I have just recieved an estimated bill for GBP280 for December for gas and electric for a 3 bed house. Everything sent is by e-mail which for your heating bills is too easy to miss and also if you sign up for direct debit they will take as much as they want and not the agreed set amount. Wish I had stuck with EON hell of a lot better than First Utility.BEWARE 
4842|This company is awful!  Their customer service is deplorable and they have a don't care attitude. I joined up with them in the summer of 2012 and I have had to call them on a monthly basis because of the constant mistakes to my bills. I have not received a bill for gas or electricity for the last three months even though I have sent monthly reading which they acknowledged they have received and the keep saying its being prepaired but nothing happens! I am getting into debt because of this pathetic company and due to no fault of my own. DO NOT MOVE OVER TO FIRST UTILITY, IT WILL BE THE BIGEST MISTAKE YOU WILL EVER MAKE!!!!!!!!!!!
4843|It takes 20 minutes to get through to anyone in customer services and this is on my phone bill.  I switched after being disatisfied with the high level of monthly DD charges and finding a better deal.  Because I was being overcharfed, the final bill showed GBP728 credit and any reasonable person would expect this to be automatically refunded.  Not so!  The sytem is that you have to repeatedly contact First Utility and ask for you money back.  I have phoned 3 times and also put in a written complaint and 8 weeks after my account ceased I still have not receive the money.  All this company does is con customers into keeping their money to earn interest on it. 
4844|"I've been trying to sign up to the First Utility iSave account for gas and electricity. Web site has been crashing all weekend. I sent an email to seek assistance and got an automated reply saying try using the web site! Phoned and after 15 minutes on the sales line got a rude and incompetent young lady who just wanted an easy life. Asked for a manager and she said ""they are all busy"". Asked when they would be available and she said ""they don't speak to customers"". Makes me laugh how one of their sales ""features"" is UK call centres! I'd rather have an Indian one than this! DREADFUL DREADFUL DREADFUL. Don't waste your time. "
4845|Same issue as some others:- Sent them DD details- They failed to put them on system and started sending me reminders then threatening letters (bailiffs / surcharges)- I have called them FIVE times to say that they were not taking what I owe them and give them my details (again) - with the first call before they had even sent me their first late payment reminder as I noticed they had not taken the payment on time- They have still not fixed the problem- Average call queue 25-30 mins each time- I despair!Undoubetedly the worst utilty service I have ever encountered. Strongly recommend you avoid First Utility as all cost.
4846|Shockingly incompetent company. They wouldn't send us a bill for almost a year despite my repeatedly begging for one. Then they billed the whole year at GBP250 a month for a 3 bed house with 2 occupants. My bills are wrong! But FU don't care. Even the Ombudsman service don't care. They are now demanding GBP300 per month for an empty house!For Goodness sake, don't sign up with them. It's no mistake that their initials are F.U.
4847|My meter readings for yesterday are not showing up in my account. I telephoned, but hung up after waiting more than 20 minutes for someone to answer the phone. That is UNACCEPTABLE! Especially on. A premium rate number. I submitted my enquiry on line, whilst waiting for the phone to be answered, but First Utility NEVER adequately deal with on line enquiries, beyond an acknowledgement email with a case number.  In other words, you can't have any dialogue with them. 
4848|"I wish I have read this reviews before. I just switch from BG to FU and straight after cooling time everything gone wrong. First they changed direct debit time than they asked for more money than BG, they supposed to be cheaper. Trying to clarify everything but no service available, no respond on emails.... Complete rubbish. They bridged all point of contract which I will you against them :-))Get your a... ready, I'm kicking really strong.To all newbies: avoid this company ""FIRST UTILITY"" - USELESS RUBBISH UTILITY"
4849|Dont waste your time with this company.They never answer their phone unless you select the option saying you are thinking about joining them.(This option are unable to help with anything other than this) Any other option and you just sit in a que waiting for an operator.They don't answer their emails either...Just an automated response.Unless you have a lot a time on your hands that you would love to waste getting no-where... STAY WELL CLEAR OF FIRST UTILITY !!!Recommend this company to all your worst enemies :) 
4850|"I selected First Utility using Money Supermarket as they came up as the cheapest. Having signed up I waited 2 weeks and heard nothing. I therefore logged on to their web site to check on progress, entering my email and postcode as instructed. Having logged on I got a message saying something like .... ""we are really sorry but we are not able to supply your property as it uses an Independent Gas Transporter (IGT).""I was annoyed that they hadn't informed me of this fact directly but decided to go ahead and select another supplier. In the event the cheapest was a different tariff with my existing supplier so I moved over to that.I emailed First Utility to complain that they had not informed me of the problem and that I had decided to stay with my existing supplier. Despite this I have had several emails from First Utility and at least 2 letter s telling me that they are progressing the transfer. They have even set up a direct debit with my bank. I have emailed them several times but they are either deliberately ignoring my emails or are totally incompetent as they have not responded.I have now formally written to First Utility to complain. I have instructed my existing supplier not to transfer my supply and have cancelled the direct debit with my bank.Be warned. Do not deal with these cowboys."
4851|We used Uswitch to move to EDF for a year from Scottish power. Nothing really wrong with EDF, but sometimes the bills felt a little opaque. When the year was up we moved back to SP and I felt that the online billing was much easier to understand. 
4852|We changed over to First Utility around January 2012 after 2 sales reps came round and assured us that they could get our energy bills about GBP10 lower that British Gas (around GBP75 a month, duel fuel) Needless to say we signed up immediately.The first bill was GBP80, a little bit more than stated but we were happy enough. The next month however the bill which arrived was for a whopping GBP200! Now we couldnt use GBP200 in gas and electricity if we tried! We phoned them and phoned them, eventally got through to someone who said we were but on the highest tariff and said that was what we had signed up for....i don't think so, why would we pick the highest tariff after all? We paid the GBP200 after they promised to put us back to the tariff we signed up for but cancelled the Direct Debit anyway and went back to good old British Gas.A month later we recieved our final bill for GBP133! Now personally i think we were even as they owed us about that much. So we ring up again to tell them this, they threaten us with debt collectors. We asked for a callback from someone, 8 months later still no callback, just lots of phonecalls asking for money. They then had the nerve to send us a letter saying they had resolved the problem and we just had GBP133 to pay...RESOLVED??? I think not. Then came more threating letters about court proceedings and disconnecting our gas and electricity, good luck with that seeing as we've been with british gas for 8 months! So another phonecall was made (think they owe us money now considering the number of times we've called them up) The bloke on the phone basically called us liars and they had done nothing wrong, we'd managed to find the paper work the rep had done all those months ago and told him his name and work ID, surprise surprise he told us there was no one with that name or ID work for them, YEAH RIGHT! Asked once again for another callback, he told us he could request one but couldn't promise anything, as to why he couldn't i have no idea!So a warning to all considering changing over to First Utility....DON'T!!! Worst mistake we ever made, should have Googled them first, that would have told us all we needed to know! They are nothing more than a bunch of Charlatans!! We are now contacting the Energy Ombudsman.
4853|I agreed to change via a comparison website, but was contacted to say they couldn't move us because we have an economy 7 meter. They confirmed in writing and by phone that they would not take our account.A couple of weeks later, I receive a letter from my current supplier saying that 1st Utility are taking over our account.Tried to phone, but kept waiting for ages (again). Utterly useless customer care.
4854|Their Customer Service is truely shocking! Their incompetence is only matched by their Regulators. Despite giving them the closing and opening meter readings after I had switched suppliers, 18 months on they were still billing me incorrectly. Even letters addressed to their Managing Director went unanswered. Avoid.
4855|We decided to give this company a try after some reps called round in feb this year we went through all the paper work asked questions as you should my main concern was were we entering any kind of contract we were told no ( a bare face lie) we were promised a smart meter after about month of being a customer of first utility this has to date not materalised and today after ringing to provide meter reads isn't likely til next year and was told that my best option for now is to ring meter reads in every month I didn't sign up for an account managed in this way and am far from happy but after making a complaint to the company in the begining about the way in which we were mislead I am certain any further complaints would be dealt with in the same way that being an advisor rings up makes promises and these are never followed through I have given them long enough to prove they are true to what they claim but after my own experience and most of the reviews I have now read that nothing will improve so have already enquired about going back to my previous supplier and there I shall stay
4856|I have been trying to get a revised bill for seven months because they estimated my usage to be GBP700 for the first three weeks when i moved into my new house. I sent them the correct readings in April and im still waiting for a revised bill....a totally and utterly useless company.Michael from Kidderminster
4857|I first became aware of the company by a cold caller at my door promising me much lower rates and a smart water meter. After an hour and a half he eventually left and as far as I was aware I had not signed up for anything. A month later I recieved a letter from British gas expressing apologies about me leaving them.I promptly phone BG and was told both my gas and electric was now provided by FU. I explained to NH and they transfered me back again. I then received a bill for 140 pounds from FU a few weeks later for the short time I had been with them.I refused to pay.Two months later I have now received a letter from a SCAnclaiming I now owe 451 pounds and I will be going to court if I don't pay! Don't touch with a bargepole!!
4858|First:utiliy have messed everything up from start to finish. The wouldn't install the the smart meter until I sent 12 complaints - it was finally installed 5 months late, but not working. After broken promises, it still isn't working. They promise to call back and don't. I pay by direct debit, but they don't take the money and blame me (they did apologise). I have queued for 4 hours and 20 minutes only to be cut off before I talk to anyone. When I do get through they promise to do something and then do nothing. 
4859|I switched using the MSE website and duly received my case of wine, FU provided smart meters, I now pay for what i use and I can monitor my gas usage per day and my electric for each half hour of every day. All presented in graphs that are easy to read, I can also download the data to excel to manipulate exactly how I want. The price is cheap and my experience of the company has been first rate. Am I just lucky or is it that the only people who write reviews are ones with negative experiences?
4860|We signed up in January 2012, they required readings every month, they send you an email requesting them, all very efficent until it comes to the bills. Every single electric bill we received was estimated. Every month without fail, even though we had provided readings, they were always estimated. We moved out in June and gave them final readings, they sent a bill in July with ESTIMATED readings. Absolutely appalling customer service, no one calls you back, no one can give you a straight answer, even when you request a manager calls you that even fails.It is now August and we are still waiting for a bill from the 11th June. (They did send one at the beginning of August which was supposed to be the final one but an email came straight after explaining they had got it wrong again so we would have to wait until September)DO NOT SIGN UP TO THIS COMPANY. IT MAY BE THE CHEAPEST BUT THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS!!!
4861|Have tried to transfer to them for last 3 months. They have lost 4 applications, I have msde numerous phonecalls to them and they say they have no record of my application even though I have phone messages from them. They promise to phone me back, managers promise to phone me back, they dont respond. Gobsmackingly awful - stay away. 
4862|"Firstly, we are not First Utility customers ! However, about 6 months ago we started receiving bills from them to our address, but addressed to a different personWe contacted your company straight away & were assured that the bills would cease. How wrong ! The bills demanding payment got more and more. I wrote and phoned & everybody has been very understanding @ the call centre. However, then came another bill ""ACTION REQUIRED"" followed by the threat of legal action i.e putting it in the hands of a debt collecting agency. By this time we were fuming saying if we had anymore letters or threats we would take our own action by handing this matter to our Solicitor. Well, so far no more letters have been received - a whole week has gone by. But still no apology!!! So much for customer service. We would'nt go to First Utility as a provider if they were the only choice! Beware, if you are thinking of joining them. "
4863|How on earth First Utility is still trading is beyond comprehension.  I don't even have gas and electric from this dreadful company but they insist on billing me every month for seemingly random and often astonishing amounts.  They are never able to explain what the charges are for and each phone call ends with some dimwit apologising and promising to sort it out.  They never have and eventually referred me to a debt collection agency for money I don't owe them.  When I asked FU what the money was for they still didn't know!  Eventually I had to refer them to the Ombudsman and this action got them to call off the debt collection agency and I am waiting to hear what will happen next.  This has been going on for just over a year and I dread to think how much money I have spent on phone calls with the amount of time I spend on hold.  The stress has been unbearable at times with whole days being written off chasing FU to sort out their unbelievable incompetence to no avail.  I have never come across a company like this before and I know I never will again because it would be impossible for another company as bad as this to exist.
4864|This company is the clown school of the energy world. In the 18mths I was with them they twice decided that my monthly electric usage had gone up 10 fold. Helping themselves to over GBP400 out of my account on both occasions. The answer I got back, 'It's up to you to check the bills!'. I asked why this hadn't flagged up to them, I was told, 'because it had happened before!'. So screwing up once gives them an excuse to try again? To add insult to injury, 6mths after I left them they decided I owed them money and starting sending debt collectors after me. The staff are extremely unhelpful and at points damn right rude. PLEASE learn from my mistakes and avoid these clowns.
4865|i came over to first utility in may 2012 what a mistake they did not take my meter reading estmated them i have given six set off reading not one as been acted on there customer service is a joke rude ubhelpfull i have not had a right bill just estmaited all the time which are way out you ring up your on the phone ages they do not answer e mails after only 2 months i am off back to british gas these are cowboys and will rip you off big time i am left with a large phone bill trying to sort my bill out  avoid this company at all cost
4866|I now qualify for my DFD. My on line bills for gas and electricity told me last month I would receive cheques within the next 28 days!  No cheques came!  Last Friday, I was told that a BACS payment would be made straight to my bank.  Still waiting!  Just been on the phone today.  It's in the system apparently.  Do these Duel Fuel Discounts exsit? That's what I want to know!
4867|Awful company. They always come up close to cheapest in comparison sites, then a few months later stop that tarrif to new customers and set up a new one, up to v11 at last count. In the meantime they increase the price mid contract on the now closed tarrifs. Funnily enough the new tarrif they set up is cheaper than the one you're stuck with. You get the option to move company when they increase their prices of course. But by only paying the dual fuel discount at the end of the year, if you leave before then, you get no discount, which of course was the only reason they were so cheap in the first place. Shocking behaviour.
4868|What a shower of c***.Harsh you may think, then switch to First Utility and experience your very own mind blowing bulls**t.First Utility are still chasing a bill (GBP483)from me from mid 2010 when i switched from them to scottish power.This is all down to their own screw ups,when I switched I phoned them up and settled my bill over the phone and was assurred this was my final bill.What a joke for some reason I thought the person I was talking to knew what thay were on about.After coplaining to THE Onbudsman and wining. I had to get all my old bills and work them out( I think that First Utility were to busy rehersing for the new muppet movie at this time).I finally worked it all out and agreed I owed them.Only the start of it I havn't refused to pay them but refused to deal with the debt collection agancies they keep sending the bill too.The Onbudsman have contacted them on my behalf so many times now I think they have taken on extra staff.I veiw this as their balls up for under billing for so long.I have just written another email to them today offering a payment plan I have a funny feeling yet again they will pass on to another agancy whom once explained too that this is ongoing soon wash their hands of it.SO EXPERIENCE YOUR VERY OWN CR** AND SWITCH (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE LONELY PEOPLE OUT THEIR)
4869|First Utility i am not going to go in to great detail about the company but do yourself a massive favor and stay well clear Outline - brought a new home oct 2011 First Utility were the suppliers told me 3 different tariffs so left in Dec 2011. 55 emails sent no reply - Its now the middle of June the ombudsman have been involved gave them 28 days to sort out - yep you got it nothing took 7 weeks still got the bills wrong they even had the cheek to charge me GBP4 a month Extra whilst they sorted out THEIR MISTAKE I am 45 years old and i have NEVER come across a company as bad as these STAY AWAY YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED 
4870|"We bought a new build a few months back and the First Utility smart electricity meter was already in place. It went downhill fom there. They got the name on the account and only put it in one name (they can't put joint names on accounts apparenty!!??!!?). I then engaged in a series of emails with them due to the length of time I was on hold everytime I rang their customer services trying to sort it out. Everytime I asked someone to ring me, everytime they just sent another email as vague as the last. They couldn't even accurately describe their own website!Eventually the solution to resolve the issue was to get my partner to ring them, pretend to be the phantom woman they'd added to the account and get the details corrected. Note that she had to ring them, they refused to ring her on a number I provided as they ""couldn't be sure who they were talking to"". Of course her ringing in on a number that they have no record of yet is perfectly fine and much more secure!! My partner works abroad so it will no doubt be an expensive busines when she does summon up the enthusiasm to ring these people.As an aside they issue a bill to start with which includes all the additional fees for not paying by DD, paper bills etc. before they've even clarified your preferences.All in all a shambles of an operation who we can't wait to get away from at the first opportunity."
4871|This company will normally featured as the lowest price BUT BEWARE if you ever need to complain or interact with customer service all you will get is empty promises and failed commitments,this will cost your time , telephone calls , postage etc etc. I was due a credit on the 1st Dec 2011 and as of today still nothing . Countless calls , countless promises but nothing. When you FORMALLY complain all they do is leave a voicemail saying will be resolved, I month on Still nothing.  They have no complaint process that offers a formal apology or any corrective action .  I think they have far too many customers and no staff to action issues.   I have no idea why OFGEM continues to  let this company to continue to trade. And finally forget a smart Meter , Mine has been promised since June
4872|One of the people at First Utility told me the only way to get your issue sorted is to raise the issue to the Ombudsman. You can call them on 0330 440 1624. Apparently once you go to the Ombudsman First Utilty get fined nearly GBP400 even if the Ombudsman sides with First Utility. Also you are likely to get GBP200 compensation. With energy companies always stealing from customers its about time we got some back. Hey it worked for me. I got GBP180 and all my issues resolved in 6 days !
4873|A young man came to my door explaining that you only pay for what you use. I had a smart meter fitted with excellent online reports. I'm saving money and I even got a 75 pound chq with my first bill for signing up at the door. These guys are different than the usual wrath that used to come knocking, you can just tell..My duel fuel discount is 180 pounds in another cheque! I love it ! Well done !
4874|Smart meters are a wonderful thing, when they work.....and so started the trouble. My gas meter stopped transmitting its readings, and so I recieved estimates, I dont have the option to read them myself, at least not with FU.  The company just doesnt appear to be able to deal with anything apart from the normal routine, if anything moves away from the norm then they just aren't very good.  I'd avoid them until they either go bust or sort out the service.
4875|"THEY TRIED TO CHARGE ME 2 YEARS EXTRA OF ELECTRIC HIDDEN IN A MISREADING ON THEIR BEHALF, IT TOOK ME 6 MONTHS FOR THEM TO ADMIT THEIR MISTAKE AFTER I WORKED OUT THE ERROR FOR THEM... YES ME!!!. THEY ONLY HAD 6 MONTHS TO READ THEM FOR ME!!THEY DENIED IT I TOLD THEM I COULD NOT HAVE USED GBP180 A MONTH THEY DID NOT LISTEN, EVEN AFTER ME WORKING IT OUT FOR THEM ON THE PHONE ON A 17 MONTH CALCULATION OF READINGS. I""M SORRY SIR BUT WE HAVE CHECKED YOUR BILLS AND THEY ARE CORRECT , THEY IS NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO!!!AFTER A GBP2500 BILL (I WAS TOLD TO IGNORE THE BILLS AS THEY WE'RE RE-CALCULATING), SOMETHING THEY LOVE DOING BECAUSE THEIR PRICES GO UP QUITE OFTEN. I THEN PRINTED OUT ALL MY BILLS AND PAINSTAKINGLY WENT THROUGH THE LOT, THEN... THERE IT WAS AFTER A CONFUSING RECALCULATION I GOT IN DEC 2011 THEY TRIED TO CHARGE ME 2500 UNITS OF ELECTRICITY EACH MONTH FOR A PERIOD OF 7 MONTHS!!! (THIS WAS NOT OBVIOUS BECAUSE THEY RECALCULATE ALL THE TIME TO CONFUSE YOU, THEN THEY HIT YOU WITH IT.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!, I PROMISE YOU YOU WILL REGRET GOING WITH THEM"
4876|We were switched to First-Utility as a result of an offer in a national newspaper.  After reading the reviews on this company, we thought better of it and cancelled.  First Utility are now denying they ever received the cancellation and are trying to force us to switch.  We know from speaking to the newspaper's agents that this is not an isolated incident.  This is certainly an interesting way of ensuring customer loyalty!First-Utility's customer service department is rather inappropriately named as their attitiude is appalling.  The few positive reviews on here can only have been writtten by First-Utility themselves.  If you wish to avoid spending time getting legal advice, dealing with trading standards and regulators then you really, really, want to stay away from this company.
4877|I had a nice young man called paul come to my home and explain what the smart meters do and how to save money. As i am a single mum with 3 teenagers our bills were through the roof i decided to join first utility. The smart meters came within 7 weeks and they have been a god send. I can moniter what i am using and cut accordinly my average bill has been about 30 pound cheaper each month. When december comes back round the GBP264 they give you back will be nice for christmas. Looking at other peoples reviews some seem harsh for me they have done exactly what they promise and i have recommended to a couple of my friends so so far so good.
4878|I changed to First Utility as at the time their prices were comparitively low. With hidden charges and a high standing charge theyt weren't that cheap after all. Then like all the others they wacked up their prices and I changed. That's when the trouble started. They took out all of their estimated bill from my account even after I had told them not to and was told that my account had been frozen. It took weeks to get my money back and I went overdrawn in my bank. I thought that that was that until now. They are now billing me for some energy they say I used up to my changover but won't send me a breakdown (meter reading) even after emails and phone calls (which nobody answers as they are experiencing a high volume of calls) yeah right!!. Insufficient staff more like. Next I receive threatening letters and they STILL won't reply to my emails. WARNING -Don't use this company. 
4879|AppallingApplied to join in January, now  in July and still no smart meter, the customer service is non existent, they simply do not care and are very expensive to boot, steer well clear...........
4880|AFTER A YEAR OF TELEPHONE CALLS AND EMAILS THIS COMPANY HAVE STILL YET TO BILL ME CORRECTLY. THEY INSIST I HAVE 2 ELECTRICITY METERS WHEN I DON'T , AND THE FIGURES THEY USE FOR ESTIMATED BILLS BEAR NO RESEMBLANCE WHATSOEVER TO MY USAGE. EVERY MONTH I PROVIDE ACCURATE BILL READINGS WHICH THEY COMPLETELY IGNORE, THEN CHARGE ME FAR MORE THAN I HAVE ACTUALLY USED. ON ONE OCCASION THEY CHARGED ME, AND TOOK FROM MY BANK GBP500 FOR A BILL OF GBP90! IN DESPERATION I HAVE A COMPLAINT LODGED WITH THE OMBUDSMAN, BUT CANT WAIT ANY LONGER, AND AM CHANGING SUPPLIER. UTTERLY INCOMPETENT CUSTOMER SERVICES REPRESENTATIVES WHO SEEM TO KNOW NOTHING WHATSOEVER ABOUT THEIR JOB. I CAN'T SPEAK LOWLY ENOUGH OF THIS COMPANY, AND IF THEY WERE THE LAST PROVIDER OF ELECTRICITY AND GAS ON EARTH I'D REVERT TO FIRE AND THE WATERWHEEL. 
4881|Please please keep away-quite frankly the worst company i've ever come across-incompetent doesn't begin to describe these cowboys. The list of complaints is endless- rude useless so called customer services, wrong readings, overcharging by hundreds of pounds and a year later i'm still waiting for a rebate -horrible horrible firm KEEP WELL AWAY!!!!!!!!!!
4882|Worst customer service ever experienced.  Do not return calls or e-mails. They have incorrectly billed me for over a year and each month I am told it would be adjusted next month.  Ombudsman ruled in my favour and yet still after 5 months the issue has not been resolved.  They are now preventing me from switching supplier.  Avoid at all cost.
4883|First have had 2 massive tariff increases in the last 8 months, the latest increasing my electricity tariff on isave v1 from 8p per kwh to 12, or an increase of 50%. Even theie current preferred tariff (isave v7) is an increase of 25%,m and in addition, the dual fuel discount is reduced by GBP40 if you change to this tariff.. When I rang them to query it, the staff did not seem to grasp the size of the increase, and clearly had not been well briefed, or may be, First themselves have not realised the impact of their increase. I would not expect them to be still in business in a few months, as people will leave in droves when they realise how they have been fleeced.
4884|Absolute disgrace!, they refused to take payments for the first 6 months and even sent us a red letter threatening the bailiffs!!. They then decided to charge us (a 3 bed semi) GBP180 a month!, when we queried this amount and worked out our own usage, we were barely touching GBP90 a month!! What worries me is some people will just pay the extorniate estimations and think no more of it!. Robbing amateurs.
4885|Worst company I've ever dealt with.  Rubbish 'customer service', bills seem to be plucked from thin air, didn't respond in time to my Ombudsman complaint (Who ruled in my favour!)  I spent a year of my life to undo the fiasco this company created and it is now my mission to spread negative reviews around the internet so you don't fall into the trap...!  Its not just me, check out others' reviews and DO NOT MOVE TO F.U
4886|WOULD NOT RECOMEND TO MY WORST ENEMY. aM UTTERLY HACKED OFF BY THEIR INEFFUICIENCY. COMPANY INCAPABLE OF CORRECTIBNG ERRIRS. MY METTER READS IN CUVBIC METERS YET THEU UBNSIUST ON CHARGING ME IN CUBIC FEET. RESULT HUGE BILLS AND ACCOUNT FROZEN.
4887|I joined this company when they promised to fit intelligent meters........ Guess what? It never happened. After 8 months I left them to go to Utility warehouse. For nearly a year First Utility sent me bills that were incorrect and tried to take money from my bank. After many threats from them of bailiffs I explained I had all their errors and communications and I was taking my file to the ombudsman. I then got a correct bill and a compensation payment of GBP150.  How do they survive?  And by the way, Utility Warehouse is great...
4888|We have been with this company for 18 torrid  months.   They NEVER deliver anything on time.   They NEVER write in response to a letter.   They soft soap you if you call and then put your complaint in the bin.   Avoid this company like the plague.              
4889|Started with them early in the year.  Everything was fine (except that a promised 12.5% discount stealthily became 10%. Then, suddenly, they said I'd been on a 3 month variable tariff - first I'd heard of it.  Their new tariff (wrapped up in talk of average bills) amounts to an increase of 23.5% against the rate which I signed up for. I'm off and they won't see me again
4890|After 3 months - price rises of up to 157% - this Company had no intention of being competitive.
4891|First Utility is the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. They promise easy online account management and accurate monthly bills, but didn't send me a bill for 3 months, then refused to collect payment after the 4th. After dozens of phone calls, all of which they tried to make it seem like their systems problems where my fault, I had to resort to paying by cheque. Then, to top it off, they refused my switch to a new supplier. The staff are rude, unhelpful, and incompetent. They take weeks to respond to email and absolutly never bother to return phonecalls. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! 
4892|I spoke to someone today to pay any out standing balances, he gave me quite a shock when he told me the bill. He broke the down in a good and understanding way.He was very patient with me has I did put him on hold for a bit.Cut a long story short, this guy VERY GOOD at his job. I want his team leaders/managers know that.It was good talking mate,have a good day,
4893|From day one I experienced awful service from this company. Switching energy providers should not be that complicated. Eon had, upon opening a new account, taken down my details wrong. Opened my account in the wrong flat, even after numerous times being informed we were in fact an upper flat, they put our details down as a ground floor flat. This meant that this flat was already registered to EON. living alone, receiving bills for a family of 5 living beneath me.I am 22 years old and felt as though i was received sexist comments for being female when asking how to check which gas mains run into my property. The whole situation was a mess. We were billed wrong, then informed that eon could not supply our energy at all. Why were we not informed this of day one?.Having provided all of my readings accurately on time, and when told to leave by EON doing so, i switched to NPower who i have received excellent service from. I have called eon on numerous occasions to be greeted by rude misinformed staff, only one adviser i found helpful. The notes on my account (which is now closed) must have been very lengthy. We were going around in circles. I was told to ignore all correspondence from EON as my account was closed, having been informed they were unable to provide energy into my property. Following this I received an outstanding bill of GBP20. I instantly phoned through to EON where an adviser told me I do not need to pay the bill, and to ignore all further correspondence my account was now closed. I have now just received a bill for GBP89.00. I have no only been misinformed by a member of staff, I have been charged for electric payments which i have already paid with N-Power my provider. It is an absolute scandal. The complaints team and customer services have not replied to me. This stress has been ongoing since september 2014. We are now in late March 2015. I have stressed emotionally and physically by this ordeal, and am now receiving debt threatening letters. What more can I say, save yourself the stress of under experienced, misinforming money grabbing company and go with a company who actually know what they are doing in terms of providing energy to your property. 
4894|"we contacted various occasion and informed why you are using estimated GAS meter reading when the tenant run out and damaged property. They are are unable to answered it and even while the property was empty they charging high bill to landlord. They dont have any evidence for the opening meter reading of the period. they are just using ""ESTIMATED METER READING "" TO CHARGE LANDLORD. WE DON'T MIND TO PAY STANDING CHARGES AND ACCURATE SUPPLY WE USED.  They have passed our details debt collectors rather then come with accurate meter reading.Worst service from eon never recommend to anyone I advice consumer to stay away from eon."
4895|I found Eon & Gas Electricity to be extremely helpful. They give the right meter reading that pays the price. They also agreed with my monthly commitment. I can stick to an accurate monthly bill. Their bills show the correct figures. Apart from it, I saw that my balance was calculated outstandingly. The advisers gave their best assistance to us and they are by far the best supplier Ive ever met.
4896|I can say that I am satisfied with their service. Eon Gas & Electricity simply amazed me because of their assistance. Apart from it, they provide the electricity that meets the needs of my family. They are ethical in a sense that I get what I paid for. I am amazed because they are a dependable supplier. Just by consistently paying the bill, you get to have the best service.  
4897|After switching to EON Gas & Electricity, I believed that it is the best company Ive ever dealt with. They also give the best value to my money. They helped me every step of the way. There is no need to be confused because their products are absolutely excellent. They are great for us. 
4898|my mother is 94yrs old &  suffers from Alzheimers and has lived with me for the past 3yrs - her own property was some 100miles away - once she had moved in her utility bills were redirected via mail service, after 2yrs this ceased so I asked the companies to send her bills to her at my address- British Gas & Anglia water had no problem with this, but E-0n refused to do so quoting Data Protection, so the past year I have driven 200miles to take meter reading and pick up her e-0n bill - despite not being able to discuss my mothers a/c with me , they were quite happy for me to pay it. On the 20th Dec 2014 I phoned E-on with a final meter reading and told them her house was now sold, on the 22nd they sent a bill to my mother at my address ( data protection!!) I received this on Christmas eve 24th Dec - on the 24th Dec they sent out a final bill overdue notice which was received 30th Dec - on phoning them that day to complain that there was only 2days between both Bills ,they at first apologised and offered a GBP15  payment, when I asked to speak to customer services about the way they had treated a vunerable customer - the GBP15 offer was retracted and custmer services REFUSED even to talk to me, quoting Data Protection - 2 further Bills have been sent, 1 on the 7th Jan received on the 10th and the last one sent on 17th Jan receive today the 22nd Jan this one threatening Debt Collection Agency. I will pay this huge bill of GBP21 for my mother today but I feel the way E-on has treated her is disgusting - but I can't complain because of their view of data Protection which thet seem to change when it suits them.Yes I do have POA but refuse to send the original documents to them whena copy should suffice
4899|E.ON is indeed an excellent company to trust. It provides surprisingly great energy and electricity solutions that only the top power and gas companies can provide. Their strategic goal is to offer better and cleaner energy and I can say they were able to accomplish it through delivering innovative energy technologies and services tailored to meet the specific needs of customers and through helping people across the United Kingdom to be energy sustained.
4900|The bills they send to you are ridiculously high and bogus. Apart from all that, the service rendered is a nightmare. I asked them to fix my boiler and they did not respond for 72 hours!
4901|Being one of the leading gas and power companies in UK, E.ON has proved that they are worth considering with their great services and exceptional customer services. I was able to easily contact the company through its contact us section in which a range of recipients are available. This enabled me to easily and directly send my enquiry to a specialist. Also, they have a separate help section when it comes to customer enquiries about electricity or gas usage in their business or home.
4902|When it comes to providing information about the installation of solar panels, I found E.ON really helpful. Not only have they provided useful information to customers, but also great energy solutions perfect for the demanding needs of consumers like us. I also get to use the E.ONís locator tool, which helped me significantly in finding the closest top-up site using our prepayment meters.
4903|Irrespective of the deal offered do not go through the painful, time consuming process of switching to Eon.  The reviews you find on line are correct and they offer a truly appalling service.  By far this is the worst energy company I have dealt with.  Although trying to wrongly blame my incumbent utility provider, Eon have failed miserably to deal with the switch of my gas supply.  The has resulted in additional costs with both my incumbent supplier and Eon as I have been unable to benefit from the duel fuel deal promised.  Every step has been painful and time consuming and I sincerely wish I had not been tempted to switch to this supplier.  I have wasted so much time already trying to sort the problems out that the last thing I want to do is spend ages on a review site typing a long message.  However, although I do not normally provide feedback on such sites I felt it important that other people should be aware how poor the service Eon provide is.
4904|E-On are attempting to charge GBP270 for two months electric. We live in a 3 bed house - with normal appliances (no tumble dryer, dishwasher etc). We are careful with lights and TV's etc. It's rare there is more than one light on or one TV and there bills are ridiculous! There complaints team was less than helpful. My advice - take them straight to the Ombudsmen who fine them instantly. I am now going through the process, as I know that they automatically get fined a hefty sum for the investigation! Do not use EON!
4905|After waiting 5 days for an engineer to come out to fix our boiler we were told we would have to wait for a certain part, he assured us it would be a priority as my husband is just out of hospital and the house is really cold, that was on Friday morning.. We heard nothing from them, we had to ring and ask if they had got the part and we were told they cannot get any parts at all over the weekend so they will order it on Monday, we phoned again Monday 'today' and were told the part is being collected later today but they have not got an engineer in our area so we will have to wait until tomorrow and it could be as late as 8 pm before they can 'fit us in'  IF they do turn up tomorrow it has taken them 9 days. absolutely disgusting I am fuming...not to mention freezing. GBP21 per month we pay for this!! I would advice anyone thinking of taking EON Central heating cover to DO NOT DO IT they are crap!! 24 hour call out is just a complete lie.
4906|I have dual fuel & a Feed in Tariff ( Solar panels ) with E.ON. They require a 2 year meter reading from a meter reader on the FIT account to check you are not giving inflated readings, so far so good, they asked for permission to read, I gave them that, on the same day they read the meter they suspended my FIT account & payment because they had not gained access to read the meter !!!! they reinstated my account but told me I had to wait 3 months till next reading to get may payment, completely out of order, the exchanges I had with them demonstrated sheer contempt of their customer. My advice would be ( the opposite of what E.ON want ) put your FIT account with E.ON but move or keep away your fuel accounts, their actions add up to trying to force you to move your FIT account away, so don't concede.
4907|Our boiler has died and looking at energy websites indicated that we could a grant to replace our oil boiler. A call to eon confirmed this and an appointment made to conduct a survey. Survey day and two people arrived and spent nearly three hours writing notes and taking photos. When,two weeks later ,we contacted eon we were told we did not qualify because we were A rated for efficiency in our house. When questioned that the boiler wasn't working their reply was that it was an a rated boiler even though it wasn't working. All in all an absolute waste of time from a company that tells you one thing then changes it's mind. Personally I wouldn't ..... On them if they were on fire. Incidentally the two surveyors left here with jars of home preserves,hope they choke.
4908|Eon alleged they were providing my electricity and that my account was in several months on arrears, so they sent a man to disconnect me (2013-2014).  My  real supplier was British Gas where I paid with Direct Debit, so I had no arrears.  The man insisted, I had to call the police.This was the beginning of a nightmare that lasted almost a year, ending with demands for payment of over GBP1500!  finally they seemed to stop.  but guess what....today 26/06/2014 they nightmare is starting again, with a letter from Eon dated 22nd June 2014 welcoming my new account! I have just been on the telephone with them, and they tell me in order to stop any further bills, I need to change supplier....therefore accepting I have an account and a debt with this crazy, unethical company. DO NOT USE EON!
4909|Unfortunate enough to 'inherit' Eon when I moved here. My first action was to change to a reliable supplier but until that happened have had to endure Eon's dreadful service.Been trying to pay the 'final' bill on line since I received it on 19.6.14 and despite daily attempts it still will not allow me to do so. they sent the bill to my new address but it is not listed so I cannot pay he bill or even email them because that also requires the new address to be entered otherwise it keeps returning to the same page.I am not about to use their 0345 tel number again after waiting 15 minutes for nobody to answer, last time. Seems I shall have to submit a cheque in an UNSTAMPED envelope.No wonder Eon are so unpopular.
4910|Avoid like the plaque.. Annual service cover totally rubbish.. First engineer left the boiler & radiator with the same leak that he surposingly came out to repair.. After waiting over wk for them to come out even after telling them leak on radiator really bad water all over floor damaging flooring..!!!! For another engineer to be sent out nearly 4 days later to sort it... Mmmm, sorted the leaks, but cos he was largely built couldn't get up off of the floor so pulled on radiator & nearly pulled it off the wall which caused my wall to crack...!!!! Phoned eon to complain & was told someone will be in touch...well no one been in touch.. Complete waste of time complaining.. U just don't get any where.. Only to be told to make a claim on yr house insurance... For damage caused by there engineer...!!!  Boiler broke down again so had to phone them as got no heating or hot water.. To be told yet again nearly a week to come out.. & this is there priority service as  have a sever disabled daughter who has to be showered 2 - 3 times a day.. They really do not care, all they care about is taking yr money.. & giving a really shabby  poor long waiting time service... I've told every one I know never to go with them... It's share hell....!!!!
4911|I switched 2 E ON about 2 years ago and I have always found them helpfuland very quick to act
4912|Overcharge on DD month after month and then money sits in their bank accounts gaining interest.  They do not allow you to reduce by much when you try, dont tell you about the overcharged amount and take days and days to refund when you do ask. I telephoned last week to get refund which I was told would be done the next day, telephoned today only to be told she didnt do it and it would take more time!  Completely rip off merchants.
4913|GREEDY    EXPENSIVE   NO VALUE MONEY   ABSOLUTELY A RIP OFF
4914|"Last month e.on sent me a bill showing a GBP23 credit on my account, I subsequently rang and confirmed the bill, gave my meter reading and asked for my Direct Debit to be reduced to reflect my usage. Fantastic!!! They agreed and reduced my monthly commitment. Thought nothing more of it and built my household budget for the next six months.Bomb Shell through the post a demand???? A demand for GBP181, estimated bill, must be a mistake? No the figures are correct and the balance is outstanding I am informed when I ring the Nottingham Call Center. How would you like to settle the account sir, I am asked????? Well I can't really I haven't budgeted for it.e.on have acknowledged the error but seem unable or unwilling to assist with a reasonable resolution.I am more than happy to honor my commitment for the DD for the next half year but e.on want to increase it by nearly 100%. They have offered a sum equal to 20% of the debit in recognition of their mistake but do not seem to understand that if I ""ain't got it I can't pay it"" So rather that collect an agreed amount they now are unwilling to collect anything???what a crock!!!"
4915|Found Eon very helpful with regards to getting information regarding my solar panel install, also confirming everything that was told to me bybtge company that carried out my install. Iqbal Mohammed
4916|IM only 23 and a single parent in.using eon pre paid and for anytime ive went to top up there taking half my money and leaving me with a few quid in my electric my gas is fine my electric is now in now sitting in the dark right now with no money the shops have shut and i have a baby to look after she's scared of the dark and i cant do nothing because eon have made me use o much money that i cant do anything i need help herer
4917|Bill doubled from pay as you go to direct debit Stay away from eon my gas has gone from 80 pounds a month in the coldest month on pre paid meter to 160 pounds a month within the first month of changing over to direct debit. This month they are quoting for is February where it's been the mild temps for 10 days reaching 17-20 degrees! They are now forcing me to pay this bill cos their meter is 'correct! Rip offs!
4918|went to change over from british gas was told they would take my per payment metres out  next letter in post two keys for me to use as not removing my metres not passed a credit check didn't say anything about it on phone now sat here with no heating cos not let british gas no that i was not stopping with them and not one of my gas cards r working for me to top up with had to put 1 star on cos wouldn't go though without it 
4919|EON are ridiculous!I have only been with them for a over a year and they have messed me around more then ever! They do not have a clue themselves who is actually living at the property or what name the account should be on, yet somehow that is my fault?The customer service advisers are rude and do not help at all! They are by far the worst supplier I have come across in my life. 
4920|I was with E-On for about 6 years. To be fair they performed reasonably initially, but over the last two years the quality of service has dropped significantly. They seemed to lose the ability to send me a bill by either post or e-mail, and preferred just sending my final demands through the post. They then removed the ability to talk to a real person, even if you are prepared to wait half an hour in a queue. Instead, they set up a system so they would call you back at their convenience. Having left E-on for Ecotricity, they now continue to try and bill me. They are clearly utterly incompetent and have no clue who owes them what. An utter disgrace -avoid.
4921|SCUMMY COMPANY RUN BY TOTAL IDIOTS JOINED WITH THEM IN OCTOBER 2013 from B/GAS AND THE NIGHTMARE JOURNEY STARTED TRIED TO PUT ME ON A DIRECT DEBIT TARRIF when i told them i was a paying customer on demand i was then told i would be on another tarrif then got the estimated bill...and the the demand from there call demand centre via my mobile and the bill hasnt been finalized told the girl NEVER TO contact me on my mobile all the usual ballocks that you would be taken to court bla bla... ...paying bill and going back to BRITISH GAS....WHAT A TOTAL BUNCH OF LOW LIFES AVOID WITH YOUR PERIL...jokers
4922|You might as well declare yourself bankrupt if you decide to use eon as your energy provider. They overestimate most of their bills, I have been in debt with them from the start, now currently owing GBP181 after 2 years of trying to pay it off. JOIN AT YOUR OWN PERIL.
4923|"I tried to create an account  but the site would not accept my email address no matter how I tried it autofill, small or capital. So I tried the auto help but it did not recognise ""email"" the next step contact us and guess what I could not contact them because it did not accept my email. My next step was the phone to dedicated complaints dept. but today they were not the complaints but enquiries. Sorry to say but the poor girl took the full force for the shortcomings of Eon Why is it never easy!!!!"
4924|Had my meters read at end of November, all up to date with payments got electronic bill compared usage to last year and over all usage is on the way down year on year.In fact it was the lowest November Bill ive had in a couple of years.Then a couple of days later I get a letter stating that EON's super computer had decided I was going to use much more gas and electricity between December and April and in order to cover this I would automatically have my direct debit increased by over GBP100 per month above my current payment.What planet are you living on EON?Next I receive a letter saying that their charges are increasing in January 14 and they are removing the 6% discount paid for using direct debit in favor of a GBP70 yearly standing charge discount.So if like me you annual dual fuel bill is GBP1400 6% equates to GBP84 per year and now cleverly in the small print this will be a GBP14 a year saving for EON now multiply that by its many customers and tell me we are not all being played due to the lack of competition in this industry.
4925|We can't believe the way we've been treated by this company.  We bought the house we're now in back in May 2013.  The previous owner rented the property out, and his tenants from last year appear to owe a lot of money - we get constant mail for them, which I send back unopened and marked not here.  They owe money to E.on, who have employed a debt collection agency to find them and retrieve it.  A few weeks ago we had a letter from the debt collectors, addressed to the legal owner of the property, so I opened it.  It was requesting the money.  I phoned the debt collection agency, explained that we're not the people they're looking for, and gave them contact details for the previous owner of the property to see if he could help.  I asked them not to send us any more correspondence, and they agreed.  But yesterday we had a very upsetting letter from them, again addressed to the legal owner of the property, demanding the money, threatening court action, and saying that the lack of response regarding the issue is not looked upon favourably.  I phoned the company and complained.  I also phoned E.on, explained the situation, and asked them to contact their debt collectors and explain that we aren't the people they're looking for.  (We have an account with them for our energy supply, which we always pay in full, so it should be obvious to them that it's not us.)  The helpful chap I spoke to in the complaints department tried to put me through to their dispute resolution team, who apparently deal with such matters.  But they flatly refused to take my call, said they won't deal with it and we need to sort it out with the debt collection agency.  I couldn't believe it.  A while back we also had a rather scary looking debt collector at our door looking for the ex tenants.  I don't know whether he was employed by E.on or someone else, but this is frankly getting frightening.  I've written to E.on today saying we're going to pass this on to the Energy Ombudsman, but in the meantime I'm getting nervous of opening the post or answering the front door.  Shame on E.on for putting us in this position and then washing their hands of it.  We've never been in debt in our lives and now this has all come to us.
4926|"We received text message from e-on yesterday (27.11.2013) to say to engineer could be with us to repair the boiler between 13:00hrs - 20:00hrs.  We waited and waited until 19:00hrs still no call or engineer turned.  So eventually we rang the service call just to be told that the part's they order were damaged.  Surely you would check this product before you accept it and then to be told it would take another week before anyone can come out to repair the boiler.Hence, we have been without heating, hot water for over a week and half now.  How do you accept one to prepare meals without hot water?  Keep young and old members of the family warm who have health problems.If the private ""engineer's "" can put a new boiler within a day why does it take e-on engineers over a week to fix a problem?"
4927|Eon profess to be customer friendly in their literature. But there breakdown service experience is otherwise. Very poor time keeping, parts are always incorrect no one engineer knows how to value the customer. Planner does little of coordination skills. Come the new year I will switch and take my custom back to British Gas.
4928|I contacted EON Central Heating Care today (26 Nov 2013) to report a defective radiator. The earliest engineer appointment they could give me is for 4 February 2014. That is a 70 day wait. COME BACK BRITISH GAS ALL IS FORGIVEN 
4929|I would not recommend eon to anyone! They over charge and their customer service is the WORST I have ever experienced in my whole life. They are VERY rude and do not help what so ever. They charge you for electric you are not even using and up your prices without even informing you. NEVER go with eon if you know what is good. Only giving one star as I have to.
4930|We are covered for parts and labour.This month we have been without central heating and hot water for 8 days whilst a new board was fitted.We are now without central heating and hot water again in the same month, so far it's been for five days and they won't have the parts / be able to visit for another two days.They have a 24 / 7 / 365 hotline and when you ring it they can get to you to look at the issue within three days, unless it's an emergency.An emergency in their eyes is a visible water leak that could damage your property or a gas leak.So if you buy this service from E.On beware, a 24 / 7 / 365 day a year hotline does not mean your boiler will be fixed any faster.It just means you will be able to report it any time you want, then sit in the cold for days whilst they get round to visiting you, then do it all again whilst they order a part.When the engineer has arrived, mistakes have been made causing further damage to the boiler. 
4931|I pay monthly by direct debit. Had agreed a monthly payment with E ON a couple of years back which they changed unilaterally without informing me. Discovered the other day that I have a credit balance of nearly GBP800 on my account. Called and told them I wanted it back in my bank account. Operative said she could do this. Asked for interest. Refused. Call and e mailed again. Was told it would take 10 working days (WHY?) Asked why they had increased my monthly payments and was put on hold. And on hold. And on hold. Gave up after 25 minutes as the operative had clearly gone off on a tea break. Promised return calls do not materialise. I hate this useless outfit 
4932|terrible company. they only have to supply electricity and bill correctly and have good customer services. they can`t get any of it right. been with them for years and when you have a problem, that is when you find out how terrible a company it is. 
4933|Switched gas and electricity to E.ON.  Found customer service very helpful
4934|I received a letter from E-ON which stated that my annual central heating service is due.  In fact, they carried it out only 8 weeks ago so I rang them (got straight through amazingly) to a very polite girl who apoligised as the letter should not have been sent out.  Whilst speaking to her I questioned the fact that during the 5 years that I had contributed to the Annual Service Plan I had only had 3 actual services.  She said, according to EON's records that I had had 5 services and she gave me the dates.  However, not one of the dates was anywhere near the three dates of the actual services.  Obviously EON's records are inaccurate and show a failing in their computer systems.  Also, if you have an annual service plan you must notify them to carry out the service or they will carry in over to the following year (they call it a contract year) so don't wait for them to contact you.
4935|I have rung Eon every night for 3 nights and waited over 20 minutes.  No one picks up the phone.  Terrible service.
4936|I had a terrible experience with eon. They are not helpful and they try to rip you off as much as possible. Specially I had a worst experience on the last time I called them. I was closing my account and the girl picking up phone was so rude. She didnt even talk to me properly. She hung up the phone while I was still talking. That was so rude. This will be the last time I use eon. 
4937|I moved into a new property and gave my first electricity meetings over the phone to E-on and everything seemed to be straightforward. Amidst the chaos of moving I left it a couple of weeks before reviewing energy charges and then deciding to move to EDF (I wouldn't recommend EDF either BTW but that's another story!) so the next time I heard from E-on was for the final bill from the date I moved in to when I switched to EDF. The only problem was they'd recorded my first daytime reading incorrectly so that the 1st digit of the meter was 1 less than it should be (which equates to 100's of pounds as opposed to about the GBP10 I had actually used since moving in). This should have been relatively easy to resolve but over the space of 6 weeks, about 15 phone-calls and various letters from them(including one threatening to pass my details to debt collectors which would affect my credit rating)they could not seem to understand or resolve the problem. It took several phone calls for them to grasp what the problem was, then at least 4 times I was assured the issue had been resolved and that I would get a revised/lower bill through the post, only to receive another chase up letter for the wrong amount. I was promised someone would phone me back and they didn't, and each time I had to speak to a different person and start the story all over again. On the plus side (hence the 1 star rating!) they were polite and attempted to be helpful on the phone, but there seems to be a major problem within their company when it comes to the promises being made on the phone translating into action that helps the customer. It seems like the call centre has no influence or effective communication with the electronic system (or the people that administer it) that produces the bills. If you have a problem with one of these big faceless corporations, my advice is to record the date/time/person you speak to each time you call and ask them to make notes on their system and read back to you what they've agreed to do. Ask them to e-mail you the actions so far and what they will be doing to resolve the problem.
4938|"I have just telephoned the ""Welcome to your New Home"" helpline for the very first time. My very first experience of EON was less than satisfactory. It took 16 minutes for the phone to be answered and the insincere repeat messages about how they cared about my call and were working hard to answer really got on my nerves. This level of wait for a response implies either incompetetnce or arrogance on EON's part. Zero points for customer satisfaction. When it was answered, the woman who dealt with my query was polite and helpful. But then, it's never the foot soldiers' fault is it? It's always the generals who define systems and strategies!"
4939|I have my gas and electric with E.ON and my old price control plan is about to come to an end. Just got two letters saying I will be on the standard E.ON energy plan with:Gas at 27.395p standing charge per day and units at 4.334p eachElectric at 27.395p standing charge per day and units at 14.07p each.Taking a look at my last 3 quarterly bills the difference is as follows:Gas old plan     Gas new planGBP83              GBP91GBP279             GBP372GBP569             GBP753Elect old plan  Elect new planGBP335            GBP365GBP246            GBP279GBP365            GBP462So will I be switching - you betcha!
4940|I WAS WITH e.on for gas for about 2 years and found them ok until my tariff came to an end. As I was a single fuel gas customer the only tariff e.on could offer was their (Energy Plan standard tariff. Due to this I decided to switch to SSE who allowed single fuel customers to sign up for capped/ fixed rate tariffs. When I signed up to e.on in 2011, there electricity prices were too high for me but their gas tariffs were more reasonably priced which is why I went with e.on for single fuel (gas).I now get 2 years capped gas prices with SSE for roughly the same price as I was paying with e.on. 
4941|I always dread ringing Eon since they take so long to answer the phone each time I have had to wait at least 30 minutes and in between the irrating automated message keeps say theua re so busy ! I have tried to ring early in the morning just after 8 and the same wait issue, I have tried to ring them during the day the same issue and I have also tried to ring them in the evening and again the same issue.Rubbish Rubbisg company - you should move away. I also deal with other utilitiy companies and never this sort of problem !!!!!
4942|the flat i lived in was a tiny flat, about 300 sq foot max. it is under 10 years old and well insulated. Several times over the course of my contract e-on tried to double what i was paying, out of the blue and for no reason. When i left the sent me an bill for 4 times what i was paying a month, saying that i had been underpaying based on estimates. the person i spoke to said that if i was only using what my estimate was i would only be running the pilot light and using no gas! basically the final bill is outrageous, i have no way to dispute it, i know they've ripped me off but there is nothing i can do about it. also their staff are bloody rude. NEVER use this company for your energy, they are on a mission to rip you off.
4943|my aunts gas meter took the money from her card however wouldnt actually go on to her account.. also her pilot light had gone out. rang e-on and told them about the problem and also that we were going on holiday in the evening, and within 2 hours they had sent out an engineer and the problem was fixed. amazing customer service and fast response!!!
4944|eon never answer phones,avoid like the plague or you will regret dealing with these clowns
4945|Called these guys to sort a query get my question solved so have to call up tomorrow.. another 30m mins wait then?What worse is my uncle has decided to change supplier and they where straight on the phone to him asking why he's leaving etc!Rubbish!
4946|Its a joke I have tried them since yest and and left 7 messages for a call backthey dont want to know. But its different if we owe them money  they would be  straight on the phone.You customer services need to call custoners back. Seriously thinking of another supplier
4947|eon tried to double my annual bill with their rediculous renewal charges, would definately not reccomend
4948|Back in 2011 I switched from Scottish gas and Scottish power.I was told I would save money.Ever since my bills have rocketed and I'm using the same amount of electricity and gas'if not less.Since I've joined they've tried to increase my direct debits.I live on my own and use little electricity and gas,plus they are full of promises which they dont deliver, like me getting the electric monitor I've been waiting for years which is now discontinued. They are beyond a joke, as soon a I pay them the amount I'm supposively in debt.I'm leaving and going back to my old suppliers. Stay away at all costs.
4949|One Star is too high. Terrible to contact. Took over 1 hour to speak to someone. Reduced my payments by 60% a month without consultation and based on an estimated reading which was grossly underestimated. No wonder people end up in severe fuel debt. 
4950|Tried to contact E-on by phone to have account credit transfered to my bank account.  Gvae up after witing 15 mins. to speak to someone?  Need to invest in more call centre staff.  Customer services very poor.  
4951|Over the last 12 months my elderly parents have had nothing but hassle with the Central Heating Care package with EON.Each time there is an issue, all EON's call centre staff are interested in doing is to get my parents to agree to a GBP400+ powerflush of the system.Last 2 instances have been for a) sticking thermostats on radiators, resolved by gently tapping the pin on the thermostat and b) bubble on one radiator - yes, a PAINT bubble.Apparently, both of the above were caused by sludge and the desperate need for a power flush.Would not touch with a barge pole, totally unprofessional and really do pressure sell.
4952|Never send paper bills, usage estimates too high, do not register payments promptly on their website, cost exceeds other providers. Terrible company, use British Gas. 
4953|Just received my annual review - gone up by GBP100 does anyone know the bank details for Eon so that I can set up a standing order as opposed to a direct debit as want to control my own payments. Can't face another 40 minute wait on the phone only to speak to a unhelpful and rude so called Customer Service Agent! 
4954|After moving in to my new house--- yes you guessed I get bills for the previous owners. When I contact EON they tell me to tell them where the previous owners are. I don't know where they are. So I am told that I will keep getting demands for payment until the dept collectors sort it out. What sort of outfit is this? They are rank amateurs and I will never ever recommend such an intimidating bunch of threatening people. I have told them I will gladly inform whoever wants to know about their threatening practice but all i got was a telephone answerer argueing about their company policy. Who trains these bunch. If I have my way I will more than gladly see them in court. Don't don't go to EON for anything. Further don't bother contacting them unless you like grief.
4955|It has literally been a nightmare dealing with this company. How they can have the nerve to be so rude and unhelpful on the phone is beyond me. I'm currently in my third year at uni and live in a flat with two friends. In the space of ten months, we have been charged over GBP2500 for our electricity. I'm not being funny but unless we were powering half of our apartment block, partaking in some illegal activity or helping to light Blackpool illuminations, I really cannot get my head around the absolutely ridiculous bills that we have been receiving. What has really upset me about Eon is that when I called to explain our situation and asked for help from them to resolve the matter they shouted at me down the phone and demanded that I pay our monthly bill (which had come in at GBP750, then and there) I was threatened with debt collection and extra charges to our account even though we have had little to no correspondance with the company and when I asked for copies of our bills the rude, obnoxious woman on the end of the line again proceded to shout and huff about the three pound charge to receive said bills. Now we have been left with little choice but to hand over a ridiculous sum of money before we have had the chance to investigate our case. If we have some how miraculously used the electricity that they have charged us for then fair enough but it is absolutely inexcusable to be rude, demanding and ignorant down the phone when speaking to a customer. I do not recommend eon and I never will, the staff we have had experience with have been unhelpful and rude. I can only hope that I get to speak to the same woman who practically shouted at me down the phone when I'm calling to get my money back. Terrible.
4956|E'on play this game with you if you pay by standing order. If you accumulate money during the summer months (as you use less gas and electricity), they reduce your standing order, despite being asked not to. So, come the first bill in winer, you are in debit. Then comes the next bill and you owe them huge amounts of money, so they increase your direct debit. It then takes you the whole year to pay it off, without accumulating any spare in your account, so the next winter you end up in debit again. I have worked this out to be a ploy to stop you from switching to cheaper companies, as they constantly keep you in debt to them. Oh, of course they put the prices up just before the really cold spell this year. That was well planned. I am not an excessive user but I was shocked at my bill yesterday, compared to what I paid in the same quarter in the last two years.
4957|This company should be avoided , my daughter moved premises 6 months ago and we infomed eon . They continue to send bills to her inrelation to her old address stating she is responsible until the landlord changes her details off the account. They are now making all kinds of threats if she does not pay up. The customer service promise to sort the problem and call us back, we are still waiting. Absolutely disgusted with them. 
4958|If you want unhelpful customer care, move to eonIf you want the product you moved to eon for to be changed by the time they've moved you across to them - thus rendering the move pointless - then chose eonIf you want to be charged for using your credit card ( when other suppliers do not), then move to eonIf you want them to charge you monthly, when you have specifically asked for quarterly and then for them to take four months to change to the right billing method, then chose eon- all the while saying that's how how long their 'system' takes (are we in 2013?)Personally, I will be moving from eon the moment I am out of the penalty period (which I am in even though the product had disappeared during sign up and sign on) and quite frankly, I am not giving them a penny more money for their totally underwhelming performanceIf I could give a minus score, I would. 
4959|"I am a buy-to-let landlord with multiple properties. Many of these properties have EON as the provider. This is not my choice, just what is there already. I have to phone the utility provider when I have new tenants move in and out. The wait time for EON on their customer services line is DISGUSTING! The average call time is 30 minutes! Sickening! On the other hand, British Gas is VERY QUICK. For this reason alone, I would pick BG over EON. In this day and age, I am sure there is no need to have such a long waiting time for customer call centers. It is just another dirty way that these utility providers take money from the hard working consumer. That the offer an option for you to go online instead is great. But when they say you are able to submit meter readings online and then once you do this, get a message saying ""we are unable to process this reading on your account, please call our helpdesk"" rather defeats the purpose.Please sort out your waiting time with customer services. "
4960|I've been with Eon (formerly PowerGen) for many years and at two properties. If I ever had any queries I could contact them very easily and cheaply, and they always listened and were happy to discuss things with me. They're also pretty flexible when I queried monthly payment changes. I don't understand why there are so many complaints on here.I'm tempted by the EDF Blue 2-year fixed deal, but I'm reluctant to switch away from a company that I like, even if I have to pay more as a result.
4961|rude, unhelpful and ignorant . WILL NEVER USE HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE, HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND CONSTANTLY CHECKING WITH PEOPLE WHEN ASKING QUESTIONS.THEY HAVE NO CLUE !
4962|ive been on eon for the last 3 years and i have never had a worse provider.a week after moving into my property a bill for GBP90 came through,rang them up and got told that they werent our provider.3 months later another bill this time with a warning from eon arrived this time for GBP500.rang them and explained we had only been there 3 months,all they were interested in was getting the money and not sorting the problem out.only when we threatened them with court did they arrange a home rep to call.he turned up on time took my details and the meter readings from when we moved in,left and said we would recieve a bill with the actual amount we really owed at the end of the month.the end of the month came and no bill,i rang them again and got told that they had no record of anyone from eon turning up.we requested a pre payment meter and was told to hold the line while they directed my call to the correct department only to have them hang up.i thought if you want to play it that way then i refuse to pay them anything.months later i recieved a letter saying they were taking me to court to have a pre payment meter installed and i would have to pay court costs.i rang them yet again and told them i had requested a meter months earlier so i would not be paying any court costs and to my suprise the only thing they did right was clear the court costs.i thought that having a pre payment meter insalled would be the end of my troubles but alas it was not to be as i found out the other week when i ran out of emergency credit to find the meters debt still rising.they are now charging me for electric and gas that is not being used.they put me in extreme debt with them by not sorting this situation out when i first moved in and i promise eon that once my GBP300 debt is cleared i will be switching provider.i have already stopped my mother switching to eon and i will be letting all my friends and their families know what a mickey mouse company eon really are.i urge anyone who reads this DO NOT SWITCH TO EON
4963|"Terrible company. I moved into a rented apparent Eon were the energy provider. It was my first time living on my own so I had no previous dealing with energy providers. I first noticed my bills were very, very high for an apparent. E-on supplied the Gas and Electricity. The bills would cost GBP120 on average per month. I was shocked at how high they were considering me and my partner didnt use the heating for more than an hour per day and some days neither of us would have the heating on. My friends and family run a full sized 3 / 4 bedroom house and had lower energy bills than me. I tried everything I could do to try and save money with e-on, turning the radiators down, turning everything off at night (at the wall) etc etc. Still this had no impact on my bill. They sent me a first bill for 0.50p... at the bottom of the bill it said the amount would be transferred to my next bill due to the amount. 2 weeks later I got a phone call from their internal debt recovery. Telling me I owe them 50p, I had to explain to them it was supposed to be transferred to the next bill? Anyway, I paid them 50p and wished them a wonderful day.The final issue I've got with this company is paying my FINAL BIll. Ive had a final bill of GBP43 to pay... When I phoned to pay the final bill I was on hold for 20 minutes (with that annoying I belong to you music playing.... Well EON I'm doing everything in my power to make sure we don't have any ties with each other much longer) When I finally got through to someone, he was most unhelpful. The problem really started when he couldnt find my account, he took everything... address, postcode, why not just ask for the account number?  Then he said, the final, Final bill was still pending? THE FINAL FINAL BILL.... and the saga continues. My advice... avoid these jokers at all costs. I'd happily sit with candle light and a cold shower than put up with these clowns.Worst company I've ever had to deal with... I've managed to type this review up while I'm still on hold.... sadly the gentleman isn't ""trained to help me"" Don't worry though, I've been assured I'm being transferred to someone who can help.... I'm reluctant to believe it. "
4964|Do not go with this company from the day I moved into my 1st new house they have put me threw hell they put my name on 7 different accounts in 7 different addresses they then sent me bills in my name that wasn't even my bills then they started sending letters in my landlords name to my address every time I called to complain they just passed me around and didn't have a clue what they were doing then I decided to have brand new gas and electric prepay meters installed on the 7th jan 2013 everything seemed fine untill I got a phone call off eon debt managment saying I had an 80GBP debt on my gas meter how? Its brand new they put me threw to prepay and they admitted it was there fault and the debt shouldn't be there as I have no debt now on the property they gave me a pin num to go and get a new card to wipe the debt which was declined 3 times then I demanded someone personally come round to my property to reset the meter and wipe the debt I have had no gas for nearly 4 days because I refuse to topup the meter for them to just take it off me for a debt that isn't even mine I have written a 4 page email of complaint and noone has yet responded there customer service is rubbish there staff are untrained and havnt got a clue what they are doing they will not let me speak to any sort of manger it is a disgrace of a company and as soon as they wipe this debt I will be moving supplier asap 
4965|"25/03/13 16:29:29Magrathea Teleco08446684033NGN numbers01:15:36GBP4.030  - This is copied from my phone bill for my most recent call to e-on and have spent so far Nearly GBP50.00 talking to their customer services department about complaints.  I have had a Energy review done by Norfolk county council who wrote to me and told me my consumption is normal but the costs e-on are charging me are extortionate ""Yes the council actually used those very words"" so I changed my tarrif and now I cant even turn on my Boiler and heating system because I quite simply can afford the GBP1.00 per hour is costs!  STAY WELL CLEAR OF E-ON unless you are a minimum consuption user - I have 6 people livingin my haouse and am electricity only No gas so I use a lot "
4966|False promises made daily and after twelve days of no hot water or heating (and counting) they still offer excuse after excuse after excuse!Absolute joke of a company and I hope everybody makes it known nationwide what a farce this company is and soon they cease to exist.Anybody that has had to go thorugh what this company has put us through will understand. 
4967|I need a new boiler and as I am an E ON customer I consulted their website.There is an online form to submit. One of the questions is about whether you want a payment plan. I clicked yes. They wrote to me and said they do not offer payment plans!When I enquired further they told me that this question is there to weed out people who can't afford to pay up front!!Trading Standards tell me it is misrepresentation and are on the case.I would dearly love to speak to their CEO
4968|In 2004 without consultation or our being aware of it Eon changed our electricity meter to an economy 12 one. So when we wished to try and improve our outlay on energy we were told that it would be difficult for us to get a comparative reading to move and because we were on this particular meter Eon could not reduce our charges either because we were on this meter.Eon agreed to change the meter, needless to say it could not be done with any speed. I then had a think about things and decided that if the meter was going to be changed we might as well ask for a smart meter as these have to be installed in the near future. When I rang back the people at the call centre said that these could not be requested. so it looks as if I will have to have a traditional meter installed and then probably within the year have to wait in and clear my under stairs cupboard again while they install a new smart meter. I think we all know who will be picking up the bill for this unnecessary duplication, still no doubt it will keep the profits healthy. I shall be writing to the chief executive and will let you know the result.
4969|last month my heating brokedown,e on took 2 weeks to send engineer another 10 days to get part.
4970|Shocking phone system. Having entered the selections etc the call was placed on hold then cut off.Very strong irish accent with call handler makes call very difficult to understand
4971|My mother paid her Eon bill  using credit card in July 2012. Eon wrote to her in November stating that the card company has taken the money back and demanded she make payment again. I never heard such an absurd thing before. She contacted the card company who confirmed they did not claim the money back. My mother provided her card statements  to Eon which did not show a credit or the disputed amount. Despite this Eon continue to insist the money has been claimed back by the card company and continue to demand payment from my mother. This matter has not been resolved and I have spent hours on the phone to Eon to request the reference number of the transaction that money was taken back by the card company. They have not provided this information and continue to ask me to contact the card company. I suspect they have an error in their system and are unwilling to reveal the information. Is it possible they have been hacked and the money has been taken by an online criminal?. 
4972|They're a good company, I just don't get home many people complain. You pay for what you use, if there is a mistake then surely this can be rectified, people with no brains would be dissatisfied as they clearly don't understand, you pay for what you use !! Personally I've been on credit meters and pre-payment and I'm not going to complain, fair is fair. Don't be a tramp and pay your bills and you'll have less problems. 
4973|The worst company to deal with, AVOID! 
4974|MY BILLS KEPT GOING UP AND UP DESPITE 2 SONS MOVING OUT, EVENTUALLY THEY WENT UP TO 125 A MONTH, I PHONED TO EXPLAIN I WAS LEAVING THEM, I WAS GBP66 POUNDS IN CREDIT, I GAVE THEM ANOTHER GBP125 VIA DIRECT DEBIT, SO SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER 190 POUNDS IN CREDIT, THEY THEN BILLED ME FOR GBP345.90, AFTER ENDLESS PHONE CALLS, I GAVE IN AND PAID THE BULK OF IT, I WAS 2 DAYS LATE WITH THE FINAL PAYMENT OF GBP45.90 NOW HAVE A DEBT COLLECTION AFTER ME AFTER I TELEPHONED EXPLAINING WHY I WAS 2 DAYS LATE PAYING!!!! THIS IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE, THESE PEOPLE ARE TOTAL RIP OFF MERCHANTS!! MY NEW SUPPLIER CHARGES ME GBP85 FOR BOTH GAS AND ELECTRIC AND IM IN CREDIT, SO HOW THE HELL WAS 125 A MONTH NOT ENOUGH???
4975|I am not happy with the service that i have received from E-on. Firtsly iv had to call them four times to get the right information. I was sent a bill that did not seem right, it was too high as i had been on holiday for 3 and 1/2 weeks. I called to give my meter readings and enquire and only to be told by advisor number 1 that she cant do anything about it. Nuber 2 told me that e-on had made a mistake and my bill would be what it was minus the estimated bill. Only to get the paper bill to find that what she had said was wrong, i was given wrong information by this advisor and i had acted upon that advice. I then called up to complaints to complain about the conflicting information the lady in complaints said there was nothing that she could do. like really?? you are in complaints and there is nothing that you can do? she could not even apologise about what had happened?? Like seriously im a customer and i have been given the wrong info and there is nothing you can do ? Why would u hire someone who clearly does not know their job or hasnt been trained to a good standard to give out right information? I do not recommend anyone to use or change to e-on as their provider. their staff are useless and very rude on the phone. Im an extremely disatisfied customer and i will make sure that i let everyone around me know about how useless e-on as a provider is.I even had a man come to read my meter once only to be told that he read it wrong?? where do they hire these people? E-on im not even going to thank you for your services but just move to another provider that is professional and know what they are doing and value customers.
4976|I have been with eon for 7 years now and I have never had any problems. customer care is good and they answer their phones quicker than other companies. Previously I have been with Npower and they were absolutely diabolical, worse service ever!!  plus my sister is using EDF and is having a lot of issues with them too.I accept that Eon is not the cheapest and yes, I have looked around and found that I could save around GBP20 a year if I switch to EDF, but you know what it's not worth the hassle and going in to a 12 2 years contract. Every other company out there claims that they can save me over GBP100 but when i worked it out i found  that I would only save few GBPs.
4977|Avoid this company. Expensive, customer unfriendly.
4978|After being in the army in Germany we came to uk we were approached by an Eon sales woman , we told her we paid GBP120 per month for fuel and lighting through the army but needed a quote for the move to UK ,we told her there is only 2 of us in the house and its a 2 bedroom ,she told us Eon would do it for GBP79 per month. Great we thought.In November we received a phone cal saying we owed money and from February they would be taking GBP216 from our bank until June so we could catch up ???? When we checked online for February up to the 16th we only owed GBP89 .We do nothing different but according to the online bills we have gone from being GBP168 in credit to owing them over GBP300 , remembering this includes summer when lights don't go on till after 9pm and there's no heating on and the house was empty for 2 weeks with nothing switched on apart from fridge and freezer????????? I smell a big fat rat it's name is Eon ,when I contacted them all they said was the readings are correct and we HAVE to pay
4979|I put 50 pounds on the gas card. Comes up with card fail 38.  Call Eon at 4.45pm. Told the card is faulty, given a number to take to a shop 4 miles away to get a new card issued.  Same thing, card fail 38. Call at 5.45pm.  Lady puts me on hold for the 15 mins until office closing time, where i am cut off.  Call back to be given an emergency number.  Told they cannot action an engineer until there is 0.00 reading on the meter. Had 61p, so call back 1.5 hrs later, when its at 0.00 and i have no gas.  Guy calls engineer and puts me on hold.  Get cut off again.  Call back, speak to the 5th different person, to be told an engineer wont come out til the morning, even though I have a 5 month old baby asleep in bed.  I guess i will wrap him up and keep my fingers crossed eh Eon? Apalling
4980|I lived in a shared house where everyone paid there fair share. We all moved our seperate ways in may/june 2011. We paid the full amount the night before we left. And now i have a debt collection letter stating that we owe alot of money which we dont. AVOID

4982|awful customer service. absolutely inept at keying information. despite being provided with the details both by phone and in writing managed to create two separate accounts with the wrong address details. Don't listen on the phone so even when providing the postal code phonetically they input it wrong. Wrote to get them to correct it and they created a new account instead of correcting the original one. Resulted in two very complicated bills with the readings switching between them and payments being taken and credited which makes it impossible to follow and work out what we are actually being charged for Gas and Electricity. In addition tried for months to get a FIT application pack, requested on numerous occasions on the phone and told it would be sent, builders had requested for us on install and still no pack. Eventually managed to get hold of one 5 months after first requesting and returned with required documents. 3 months further down the line upon chasing up re the FIT (again) told can we please resend the documents as though they can see they have received them they haven't processed them and don't know why not. Can't now find the documents so require us to resubmit before they can look into.Absolute joke!Would rate zero stars if it was possible.
4983|Promised prioty service for disabled household, thats a laugh no heating or hot water and the earliest callout 3 days!!! another mis-selling issue. Dont waste your money on this provider, you will only be let down in your hour of need.   
4984|I wrote to inform e-on of the death of my father, the account holder, and asked them to make a simple change - make my mother the account holder (joint property owner). This appears too difficult for  e-on, who proceeded to send letter after letter to my grieving mother addressed to the execututor of the estate talking about irrelevant probate (three on one day).After the first letter e-on customer services said it was a mistake and would be stopped...
4985|I Have been with E on for gas and electric for years and years. Had no problems at all. Customer services always been helpful and friendly. Have all my bills on line. Only things thats a bit confusing is all the different tariffs they offer. Once i had looked into them all was able to find the cheapest and most suitable for us as a family and found it reasonable. I have recently changed my heating service contract to them as British Gas had offered a disgusting service for the years i had been with them. Recently changed it to Eon. Havent needed to call any one out to any problem yet so cant comment on that side of the company as yet. I am moving house soon and very unsure of what company to go with for gas and electric as i am moving to a different area. Reading reviews on this site,every company you read about gets slated, hence my positive review of eon as they deserve it i think
4986|"I joined with eon when i moved into my first flat 01/05/2012.Everything on paper was looking sweet.You get clubcard points and very low charge on electric and gas.So i signed the paperwork.BIIIIIG MISTAKE!!!My first electric key arrived in the post. DIDNT WORKSo i phoned them up.Second key arrived. DIDNT WORKPhoned again.Third key arrived DIDNT WORK!!!So as any normal person i was fuming.Not an easy straight forward process for beginners and it caused alot of stress.Which is not a good impression to begin with.Well that isnt the start of it!!!I cancelled with eon mid/06/2012.I joined scottish and southern with no problems at all and im still with them now :) being 23/11/2012Eon started the whole ""you owe us money"" sending letters.How can it be when1.My electric is a key reading so i get what i pay??2.Direct debit set up of GBP30 a month for gas.Eon worked out i was using roughly GBP20 a month after christmas winter period.So i should of been due money back if anything.They gave me all sorts of reasonsElectric charge was GBP15.00 (October)I tried phoning them to pay for the electric just so it was out the way and never to hear from them again.Was on the phone 3 times waiting half an hour each time and gave up.They then got uds to chase it up.So it made me feel i was not doing what i should of done and pay it straight away.Saying because they had to wait for a gas reading so there was a charge for that.Which scottish and southern gave them ages ago.They have just charged me GBP10.87 Just near the end of November!!! for what i supposedly owe them.Am i ever gonna get away from eon saying im due money!!!Its been a total shambles and i wish i never joined with them in the first place."
4987|Twice I rang EON.First to help move gas and electric origin.  No help.Second to ask for up to date bill.  They would not give this to me as I did not know my account number.  I replied but you will give me a bill if I change service provider.  No comment so hung up and changed service provider.  No time to talk to idiots on the phone.  Thanks EON.
4988|When I moved into my flat in July this year, the current supplier was Eon.  I made arrangements almost immediately to switch to Scottish Power who I have been with in the past and never had any problems with.  The switch happened in September but time after time I received only estimated bills from Eon.  The final bill was wildly overestimated (electricity meter reading jumped from 615 to 2794! It's not even near 2794 now months later!) I called to correct them but because I'd already switched to SP I was told had to give them my meter readings who would subsequently give them to Eon (seems sort of a roundabout way when I had the reading there in front of me, but okay). I was told not to worry and I'd receive an actual final bill about 4 - 6 weeks.  The other I received a new final bill.  Again estimated.  And only detailed the gas meter readings which were not in dispute.  The amount was slightly less though.  The day after this, I receive a threatening letter from Utility Debt Services for the original estimated amount.  Now panicked, I call them about my dispute with Eon and then call Eon to ask what the bill referred to (as I suspected this was still incorrect given the electricity readings they had previously claimed but now suspiciously left out).  I was told categorically this covered the updated meter readings from Scottish Power and after about 25 minutes on hold I was so defeated I just paid the amount to have the whole affair over and done with.  I don't know if that was the right thing to do, but I don't want any debt services harassing me. I am only 25 and do not want to accrue bad credit.  I feel absolutely sick and would not recomment Eon to my worst enemy.  I did not even choose them myself.  Terrible company.
4989|"I moved into my apartment on February this year and set up an account with E.On. The person told me that the best thing to do was to put me on a fixed price until June 2013, which apparently ""protects any increase over the price of your plan"". I was put on a GBP30 a month charge. I was not expecting my payments to be reviewed until June 2013. This is what they had told me.Yesterday however, I received a notification that E.On were increasing my monthly direct debit from GBP30 to GBP148!!!! that's nearly 5 times the amount they are charging me per month!!I got straight on the phone to them and found out that I had apparently built up a GBP500 arrears sum on just electricity in 8 months. I was livid. After a few phone calls to get the result I needed, I was informed that I was put on the wrong package. The fixed term thing I was on was for over 65 years of age. I am 36. What a mess up. They are now going to send someone out and see if my meter is correct, and then apparently arrange a proper plan with me. I'm damned if they expect me to pay back the GBP500 odd quid in arrears. This has come a month before Christmas. Nice one E.ON!! I am not being made to pay for a mistake you have made. You should have ensured I was put on the correct package to start with. How can you make a mistake when I gave my date of birth as being born in 1976 and you think that I qualify for your package for over 65s???!!! "
4990|waited on hold over an hour customer service was shocking, they sent 5 different gas cards till i made them send an engineer out as i have a young daughter we had no hot water or heating !! i then asked for meter to be changed as hated gas cards i booked day of work unpaid they advised me engineer would be here between 8 and 12 and guess what no engineer!!! ive called they said the company not booked it in, im so livid right now waiting for a manager to call me back if they cant do it today not sure what ill do as i work monday to friday they apparently dont work weekend. dont go to eon its worst company ever i was with british gas for years and wish id never left
4991|Ive been with E.ON for a year now and I can say, without a doubt, they are not professional in any sense of the word. As a business owner myself, I would be shocked to here about any one of the following issues:The first and most ridiculous even took place less than 1 month after acquiring them as a provider  not my choice, they came with the home. I received the Change of Address letter a mere 1 week before receiving the actual bill and when the bill did arrive it was incorrect. I am a very exact person and when something doesnt make sense, I will always enquire, so, I called them up. It took 3 days in order to get in touch with them, as their phone lines were completely busy  which I dont mind at all. What I did mind was what happened next.The E.ON employee who picked up the phone sounded like a decent-enough human being at first. She was seemingly-polite, simply asking me why I had called. I do not like to judge people too quickly, but I soon came to realise that this woman clearly hated her job and/or hated her customers. I explained to her that my bill was not tallied up correctly  that it included a small fee for when the landlord sent renovators over to the home to fix it up before I moved in. I was not bothered about the fee or the amount, however as it was not my bill to pay, I wanted it to be deducted from the total bill  a simple request, you would think.Instead, the woman on the other end of the line began questioning every detail of this very small sum. Luckily I am the type of person who records every detail I can and I prepare for any question I can imagine being asked. I answered her questions of when I moved in, pointing out that even E.ON had the correct date on the bill, yet somehow they still managed to pass on the previous (landlords) bill on to my name. She also asked me what the current meter reading was  something I found quite irrelevant to the question at hand (remember this for later). After a lot of Uhms and Uhs, she finally agreed that E.ON had made a mistake, HOWEVER, instead of simply fixing the bill and being done with it, she decided to THREATEN ME instead.She then told me that she had Updated my account, and that (guess what) I know owed EVEN MORE than the original bill pointed out. Thats right, she even had a tone of complete innocence when she said it. Her reasoning was that because she updated the meter reading to todays amount, the bill now reflected me as owing slightly more than the bill was in the first place, even taking off E.ONs mistake. I told her I was completely fine paying this  because it was my bill  but it was NOT DUE YET. The previous bill accounted for, I believe, 28 days of usage. Calling her on the 30th day of usage caused the bill to go up by 2 days use. She then asked me if I would like to pay the new amount, or if I would like her to revert the bill back to the previous amount  including the incorrect billing amount.Yes, thats right. E.ON condescendingly increased my bill amount only to reverse-blackmail me into accepting the lower amount. I always try to prepare for every event in a phone conversation with crooks such as the Gas/Electric company, but I was completely taken aback by that. By the way, I was not rude  I never am to strangers  and I spoke very politely to this woman. At this point, however, I told her that I would Think about it, and call back later. In hindsight, I know what I should have done: Told her to tell me her name and badge number immediately, and to talk to her supervisor about what she just attempted to do. Instead, I called back the next day, talked with a man who was much more polite, mentioned to him what the previous woman had done and got slightly more off my bill than I originally asked for. Also, by the way, I figured out all the maths to ensure I was asking for the exact correct amounts  I did not estimate as E.ON, themselves, love to do.That is the main issue I have with the service provider E.ON Electric. Below are a few further things worth mentioning over the last year:The servicemen buzz on the door over and over. I actually thought it was a child playing a prank of some kind, but it turns out to be a rather obnoxious E.ON technician. E.ON technicians have left note cards that they will be coming on such-and-such day to take a meter reading. I have purposely taken time off work in order to let them on to the property, only to have them never show up. This has happened at least 3 times.I do not usually answer the door for people whom I was not expecting, so when E.ON technicians show up day after day, week after week, I do not always talk to them as they have not indicated to me why they would send someone over in the first place. They usually do not leave cards or notes of any kind  only after pounding on my door for what is probably the 14th day in a row do they finally write a 5 second card indicating what they want.Well, thats it. Guys, personally I dont like most big-business companies  they are ought for every pound they can swindle and they usually do so without the slightest explanation as to why. E.ON raised their rates within 6 months of my switching to them and the letter said it was only a trivial amount, although (as I like to do the math) it was actually about a 10% increase in overall cost per billing cycle (which are erratic, btw  sometimes 2 weeks, sometimes 2 months, sometimes 4 months.)I would NOT recommend E.ON to anyone I cared for; I would only recommend them to my worst enemies and even then Id have to think about it.
4992|Been with Eon just over 1 year, received only estimated bills, constantly demanding payment. I have not been offered any kind of new tariff to help me save money. Nor have I been offered any way to provide online final bills. Their customer services team is based in Nottingham and quite frankly I've never dealt with a more incompetent energy team. They are rude, arrogant and unhelpful and actually accuse the customer instead of providing customer support. In the past I have been with British Gas, Npower and SSE and all 3 have provided some kind of basic level of customer services. Eon provide absolutely nothing and just demand and expect payment. One good example is that they estimated my summer bill (May to August) to be about GBP600 when we don't even use gas or electricity on during the summer months apart from to heat the boiler.When I refused to pay they sent had a threatening letter from their credit collections Company to my address without warning.  I do not usually write online reviews but can I please advise to all the thousands that will be switching like myself before the energy hikes in December, DO NOT consider Eon as a viable alternative or get sucked in by one of their deals. If I could give no stars I would. Absolutely terrible Company who need practice in basic manners as a requisite.  
4993|E.on are very bad company,we called them to change the battery of my gas machine because I used card for the gas, they came and changed it and opened the gas without telling me about it. Now after I moved they sent me a bill to pay 440GBP, which 290GBP for 4 months and the rest they say we have not paid. We have now paid the 290GBP but when we call and say why should we pay extra they say we have not paid and why should we pay 150 GBP if we always used card.they are real bad do not go on it.
4994|E.ONs new best deal for you thing that they advertise on their new advert is great. Really simple price plans and when I rang the lady I spoke to was lovely and friendly.Thank you EON!
4995|I am fed up of receiving calls from call centre(s)representing eon trying to sell me a cost saving utilities package.  The callers will not listen and just carry on talking over me.The number I am being called on is registered with the telephone preference service but when I call 1471, the callers number has been with held.I have a very busy job and can well do without these unwarranted sales calls.Please will someone from eon contact me by email to planecaptain0@gmail.comto follow up on this complaint.Extremly agitated/annoyed NON CUSTOMER who NEVER WILL BE A CUSTOMER of eon.
4996|75year old gentleman discharged from hospital to find his heating has broken down. Pays a monthly fee for breakdown cover and advertise 365 days a year 24/7 service.  Yet they make him wait over 4 days with no heating or hot water.  Terms and conditions clearly state he should be treated as an emergency!  Disgraceful service avoid at all costs!! 
4997|i am livid with frustration,we can either get heat or hot water with our boiler,e-on send the same man out time after time,he complains that he cannot climb the ladder to the loft ,so i asked for a more senior engineer who can do the job,guess what ,they sent the same guy,he has been in the loft scratching his head for a while now,not much chance of a hot shower this year either,it's disgraceful.
4998|Telephone system, email forms or web-site , none of it ever  works. Even trying to leave a meter reading ends up with bing put on hold for an operator!
4999|I moved out of my flat last month and made it my priority to finalise all my bills in good time. After finalising my last bill with eon, I confirmed with the customer services team that there would be no more payments left. Just over a month I receive a letter asking for the final payment of GBP35 with it also saying if the payment is not received by 28th august they would send a debt agency round. Now this is the first I had heard of it. I could understand that letter being sent if I hadn't responded to calls or emails.. but I had nothing. And the worse thing is, eon credited my account with the GBP35 with me being aware and is now demanding it back and sending threatening letters when it was their mistakeI am not happy. Be very aware of this company. I think they seriously need to consider staff training. Now if I don't pay on time that will go against my credit rating for their mistake. Do not go with eon
5000|Have a broken boiler that is not working and although it is covered, have been told that it will be 7 working days before an engineer will be available to even look at it.  It is not feasible for a family to live 7 days without hot water or heating.  They are useless.  The only justification given was that this situation was not an emergency.  Well - if there were a gas leak, there is a legal responsibility for the service provider to be on site to resolve - so if the boiler is not working - then what else constitutes an emergency?  Misleading use of the term, 24/7 emergency call out.  Never rely on E.ON
5001|"Terrible experience! I signed over to Eon 6mths ago, my bills for the year with my previous supplier were reviewed with the sales rep. She tld me EON are the cheapest and quoted me a price which i was happy with.  All was fine until 6mths down the line i receive an updated direct debit for double the price! Now i stay in a one bed flat! My heating is never on because i am rarely in the house! I phoned up with my readings to query the readings which they had.  Now miraculously the readings seemed to be lower than the ones passed to them by the EON rep who read my meter! Now either their staff arent trained in reading meters or they are trying to get as much money as possible from their customers! The man i spoke to on the phone advised me to clear the outstanding credit of GBP150 and my readings would go back to the previous amount!!! Despite my initial phonecall EON have started taking double the money off me in the form of the updated direct debit!A follow up phonecall to a very unhelpful girl followed in which she said several times, ""well thats what you use in electricity and gas - we dont make it up"" Now to me, they employ dodgy sales tactics, promising what they cant deliver! I am now changing back to my original supplier and  with my new supplier i have full boiler cover and i am GBP35 per mth better off! DO NOT GO NEAR EON! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DODGY SALES TACTICS AND MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER SUPPLIERS! "
5002|I have not used E.ON for my Gas or leccy supply, but I have used them for over 5 years for my Central Heating cover, and I have little cause to complain.The combi boiler in my house is easily 15 years old, but as it is a popular glow worm model, all parts are available and the unit fully serviceable. As you would expect, the boiler has occasionally broken down, but E.ON have on every occasion (but not always on the first visit) been able to bring my boiler back on line. I honestly believe it now runs better and more efficiently than it did 5 years ago!Other central heating cover companies I could mention would I am sure have declared this boiler as 'end of life' due to its age to try and make a quick buck, but not E.ON. After one breakdown call out, they ended up replacing over 5 components with quibble or hassle, and the boiler runs great. I also found the annual servicing easy to arrange on-line.Almost Top Marks to e.on then. The only thing I would say is that some boiler engineers are noticeably more experienced than others, so sometimes a fix has taken a couple of visits.
5003|"I have been with E-On for just over a year, switching to them after they approached me with lot's of promises. In just one short year however, EVERY single one of these promises were broken. Upon switching over to them, I was told that they would take care of everything, this did not happen. It wasn't until over A YEAR LATER, when I called to give them my final meter readings that they smacked me in the face with a bill for nearly 500 pounds, purely because everybody I dealt with, failed to do their job properly and ""take care of everything"". As a result, we hadnt been paying for ANY of the electricity we had been using over the year. It is absolutely disgraceful that a company that large will not take responsibilty for the shortcomings of their staff. Absolute shambles! Never doing business with them, and it has most certainly NOT been a pleasure!"
5004|We have recently moved back into our property which had been rented to tenants for 2 years. The tenants had not paid their energy bills fully and, it has now been revealed, had falsified information about the date they left the property. We then began receiving bills addressed to The Occupier at this address which referred to the period that the tenants were here, but claimed they were not. This has been a great worry to myself and my husband. We contacted EON and their advisers have been fantastic. We were immediately reassured, were asked to provide proof of dates of occupancy, which we did and have been contacted this morning to assure us that the matter is in hand, that we will not be contacted again as The Occupier, and that we have no need to take any further action. We are delighted and immensely relieved. Thank you to all at EON.Also just briefly. We have a contract for central heating care. The boiler was not working correctly and we called out an engineer. Again, the service we received was first class, from the original phone call to the engineer diagnosing and repairing the boiler. Again, thank you to all the staff we dealt with. Wonderful service.
5005|I'm eons customer from about 4 years n I had put premeeter to pay GBP5/week for my dabts from my old flat about 3 years ago. Just recived statement wheres wright that I own alot of more money to them then in time when I got put my meeter! So I called them up with help of my english boyfriend n I found out that I own them GBP2000!!!!! Till now I had 2 pending litigation but for GBP300 n never nobody by this all years never mentioned GBP2000!!!!! Thats big lie made up by eon,I spoke even with manager Dave who put phone on me! Im going to the court with it cos in every letter of eon never bein mention this bill and I got proves on paper n my online account! never ever in my life won,I will say to everybody about it n make them bad opinion cos they deserved it. 
5006|After falling on hard times and trying to arrange a payment plan EON kindly took me to court for disconnection. They said they would charge GBP250 for this! I attended court and gave the magistrates over 60 pages documenting phone calls, letter etc which clearly proved they EON had made no attempt to help or to accept a payment plan. I won the case and the judge ordered them to help. They made no effort to contact me instead they sent another summons, claiming they knew nothing of the previous case. After a dozen or so further phone calls we agreed a monthly payment plan, which I pay weekly. Watch out for there ILLEGAL GBP55 adjustment on you bill for letter they don't send and visits they don't make. Watch out for bullies on your doorstep and record all letters phone calls etc because they will deny everything. Then you try to change supplier and they block you doing it! The moral if you get in difficulty change supplier before you have a debt otherwise you will be prisoner of EON and subject to a mass of ILLEGAL GBP55 charges.
5007|Recently I contacted Eon regarding my account as I suspected I was owed money. After having to wait over 30mins just to speak to someone on their premium rate tariff, I asked if they would phone me back, but they refused. I then enquired about the issue. I was told I would be repayed 14.97 when I was sure from entering my details into an automated service I was owed at least three times that. I was assured this was the correct figure (the manager - whose name was patrick btw, for the record - seemed to pluck the figure from the air and even did some sums on his calculator to confirm???!!!) and told I would be sent a link immediately to my account, so I could check the details for myself.Alas, the link was never sent, and the discrepancy never explained to me. I tried to login but conveniently there was some sort of problem with the login page were down so I couldn't register my account. I then issued a complaint. I was told the promised email had been sent to me (trust me, it wasn't - I received no email) and there was no mention of the amount I was owed, or where the figure 14.97 came from - which was the main part of my complaint.So I finally manage to log in and lo! I was owed 78 pounds and 6 pence, unsurprisingly to me. I have since requested the repayment in full and am waiting (again) to hear from them.So they have essentially lied to me, stolen from me, and then lied about stealing from me. I recommend everyone steer clear of this company, they are exasperating to deal with (to put it kindly), and seem to refuse to give you an honest answer regarding, well, anything.If I can spare one person the stress this has caused me then it will have been worth writing this review, as I hate to waste any more of my life dealing with/talking about them than I have already. I have read countless other reviews mentioning the same type of issues, many on a much bigger scale (we're talking thousands of pounds) and would hate for anyone else to suffer their inadequacies (again, being kind!).I wish all of you the best of luck in avoiding Eon.Greg
5008|"Eon gave me a set figure for my monthly direct debit.  All was well.  A year later when they reviewed my account they informed me I am in debt to them - three times my direct debit amount.  Angry, I paid my debt and left them.  They contacted me during the switch and promised this would not happen again if I stayed with them.  Foolishly I agreed and a new direct debit figure was arranged.  Now a year later, exactly the same has happened again but this time my debt is nearly seven times my direct debit amount!I can't switch to another provider until this debt is paid.  Eon are most definitely experts in ""debt blocking"" customers.Next time I leave I will not be coming back."
5009|"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT CHOOSE EON!EVERY EON STAFF MEMBER THAT IVE SPOKE TO ARE SO UNHELPFUL EVEN THE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT STAFF ARE SO RUDE,CUT YOU OFF THE PHONE AND TELL YOU ITS NOT THE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT YOU NEED??

5010|I have had the misfortune to use Eon in my last two living places, they being the supplier when I arrived at the property. Both places had a prepayment meter fitted so as a temporary tenant I was quite happy to use them. After living for six months in a flat I was making arrangements to leave so I gave notice to Eon. I was surprised to receive a 'final bill' for GBP60 - If I had been paying for gas in advance how could I possibly have racked up a debt at a rate of GBP10 a month? I looked into how the system works and discovered that they had no right to charge me this money. With a prepayment meter, you are doing precisely that, paying for the energy used in advance. The supply company are able to change the price for energy remotely, by adjusting the meter through the prepayment key, and if they fail to do this then legally it is their own responsibility and they have no legal recourse to reclaiming any extra they have failed to charge. Given that I was in the property for such a short period of time, and given that they were attempting to claim GBP60 I was very suspicious that this was just some random number they were attempting to scam me for. However, given I had to demonstrate to the landlord that all final bills were settled to retrieve my flat deposit I needed to get this sorted. So I rang them. I explained that legally I had no requirement to pay as it was their responsibility. The woman on the phone said 'errm, hang on a minute.' She came back and declared the debt written off.Eon were the energy supplier in my new home in a different city and I used them for a year, until realising that the deal with Npower is actually significantly cheaper. So I changed. As I fully expected I was sent a final  bill for the electricity, this time the random figure was GBP80. I rang them and announced that I was recording the call for legal purposes and asked them about the final bill. Without any hesitation I was told I would not be expected to pay it and that it was an adjustment figure which I owed, but which I was not obliged to pay. I asked the operator if this was Eon policy to send prepayment customers a bill which they are not obliged to pay and he claimed not. He also said that they would never take a customer to court for not paying a bill they were not obliged to pay. Despite this, they do threaten court action.Six months later, I receive a bill from Eon, this time for GBP70 for gas. This is six months after I have left them. I ignore it. I have better things to do with my time than play at not paying imaginary bills from Eon.  They pass it on to their internal debt collection agency and threaten increased costs and court action. They also offer me the chance to ring them - on a profit share phoneline - in order that they can make money out of me ringing them. I decline the offer. They ring me and ask me to confirm who I am and prepare to ask me a ton of questions to prove it. I point out that they know who I am as they phoned me, and that it is they who should be proving to me who they are seeing as they have phoned me uninvited. They say they wish to settle my account and cannot without my going through their confirmation spiel. I tell them there is nothing that needs settling and if they think otherwise to take me to court. Whilst in court I will counter-sue for harassment, loss of wages and any other costs I can think of. They put down the phone despite my firm but fair and polite refusal to discuss their ridiculous scam.Despite claiming to the contrary, Eon clearly have a policy of trying to scam leaving prepayment customers with a 'final bill.' Unless you have been put on a prepayment meter to clear an existing debt there is no obligation to pay this bill and in all probability you do not owe anything anyway. If you prepay for a thousand pounds worth of gas and the price goes up whilst you are using it then technically you would owe money for the gas used after the price increase which you have paid for at the lower rate. However, legally you still are not obligated to pay for this. If, like me, you top the gas up each week or month then the period you may be getting cheap rate gas is only from the date of price increase up until the next time you put in your meterkey, when the price of gas gets reset to the new higher rate.I find Eon to be scamsters and having dealt with them a few times now at different addresses it has become predictable what will happen next. They will try and scam you. If they are doing this with prepayment customers then I dare say that those who pay by other means will be having their arses skimmed too. I would suggest Npower, much cheaper and far more helpful. I would like to give them 0 stars. Unfortunately this system doesn't allow it so they get one star through no other reason than necessity.
5011|I have been with E.ON for my full central eating care since 2008 but in April 2012 I telephoned E.ON to arrange an annual inspection for my boiler and was told the earliers appointment was the end of June! I am very dissappointed with the length of time I will have to wait for my boiler to be serviced. Hoever E.ON are still competative on price compared with British Gas, Home Serve and Scottish Power. 
5012|I have been with E.ON for my gas supplier for around 12 months now and since joining E.ON I have mostly been in debit for my gas account. I find their discounts to be less generous than Npower's as Npower give a GBP55.00 discount for gas customers who direct debit their payments with a 12 month unbroken supply. I was never in debit with Npower for my gas and I am only using roughly as much gas as I did with Nopwer. I like how E.ON send me quarterly statementsfor my gas whereas Npower was every 6 months! E.ON are worth trying but are not one of the cheapest suppliers for gas in my opinion. 
5013|i have lived at my address for 16 years and also on a payment meter with eon for my elactric i was told last week that my supply number is for my next door neighbours address and not mine i contacted eon to tell them they have not been supplying me they phoned me back the next day saying that when i changed my supply in december to british gas that it was british gas that had put my supply number as next door yet my letters came to my address from eon and british gas all though when i changed supplyers in december i changed my mind and stayed with eon so i phoned british gas today and told them what eon had said and they told me they dont have access to change my address from my supply number so are eon just fobbing me off cos the owe me money hope you,s understand what im trying to say as its all complicated to me 
5014|I called Eon after our gas engineer diagnosed a problem with their meter. Eon told me it was National Grid that dealt with the meter. National grid came and looked at the meter type and told me it was Eon that should fix as the meter is their meter. I called eon again they booked an appointment to fix it after much deliberation. They then didn't turn up on the day . I called back and went through the problem again and they then put me on hold and cut me off. Guess what... They didn't ring me back!!!!
5015|Just completed a rubbish email survey by e.on, getting nowhere near the issues that matter to me:-1. Electricity and gas, sold largely by six suppliers is an oligopoly, getting fat on our money. For example:-1.1 They ask for my meter readings, which I give honestly and promptly, then a meter reader comes round to check.1.2 We have a transformer opposite with a fence round it. It was replaced, although the fence was perfectly good, with another identical fence....that they can waste so much money just shows how they're taking us for a ride.Regards, Nigel
5016|"Well Eon are quite possibly the worst verminous cretins I have ever had the misfortune to deal with in my entire life.We had no choice but to go with them as a group of 6 students September 2009, our Landlord was with them. Fair enough. Whatever. The first hint of stupidity should have put us off, we should have demanded a change. When we rang to put our names on the bill, we were told only five names could fit on. Excuse me? Right... so, this last person? ""Oh, we'll put him on our system"" ... fine. That was then the start of the problems that still haven't been solved, almost 2 years later. Other than a ridiculously over the top estimated reading for our winter bill (GBP300 more than it was, we rang them to say oi... no.) we didn't really have any problems. Final bill time came, and our guy who was not on the bill but ""on the system"" wouldn't pay his share. It wasn't a lot in all, but that wasn't the point, so we held off, trying to get the money that he owed. The GBP26 or whatever it was suddenly appeared as GBP400 after we received some rather nasty calls from UDS (Utility Debt Services) ... ! Originally we thought this was with getting them involved, court charges, whatever. No, apparently it's added, on top of, what we paid throughout the year. New tenants moved in after us, didn't give a reading when they moved in, only TWO MONTHS LATER, and bish-bash-bosh, the readings don't add up. So we had a back-and-forth game between them and us, and it's now been ""officially decided"" by Eon (as of January) that they can't prove it was them, and they're doing us a ""favour"" by saying we now owe GBP350. It's a third party dispute between us and the Landlord, and they will no loner get involved. Right...Nothing until today. A member of the group gets a call, presumably from UDS. We tried playing ball. Tried to explain we couldn't POSSIBLY owe an excess of (originally) GBP400, but they wouldn't listen to reason. Cretins. No chance are they getting that money, more than a year after we finished our obligation, moved out, and our account was closed. Oh, I forgot to add that they accidently sent us a GBP10 cheque, saying we were IN CREDIT around Christmas. Useless, the lot of them. AVOID.   "
5017|"So I rang today as I had cleared a debt to e.on and asked for the meter to be adjusted so that i was no longer paying my debt weekly. After waiting for 35 minutes. The person I spoke to seemed fairly clueless on what was going on and what to do. She did evetually tell me she was going to send a message to the meter to get it removed and refund any credits It takes off me in the meanwhile. But to be honest she seemed so dim that I have no faith in her and will call back later to check it has been done. My next query was that the door on my meter cupboard was broken so could they please fix it as it was constantly banging and crashing all day and night. She told me that it wasn't up to them and that it was my landlords responsibility so to ask them. Explained to her that there was no way i was going to bother my landlord with something like that as I am not a tenant which likes to bother my landlord constantly. I asked her why they didn't do it any more, she just said because they don't.... HELPFUL! I then asked her where she suggest i buy a new meter cupboard from... She told me it was up to my landlord. I again explained to her that I wasn't going to bother my landlord with this so could she suggest where i buy a new meter cupboard from. Her response, like a parrot with poor language skills was: ""its your landlords responsibility"" Multiple times I tried to tell the unintelligent Tina that this was not going to happen as i would not bother my landlord with something so trivia. She said she didn't know where to buy it from or if you even could. Again.. HELPFUL! Tina then told me..... ""your landlord can claim on their insurance"" (long pause while i took in the stupidity of this statement.)I asked Tina whether she personally had insurance, she informed me she did. So i pointed out that she would be aware then that claiming on your insurance for something so trivia would be ridiculous as it would put up premiums, excess etc... i advised her that this was a ridiculous statement and i could not believe she was recommend people do this. So Tina the woman who had language skills of a french parrot speaking english went back to her ""it's your landlords responsibility"" So Tina, thanks for your help. I thought that E.on would use IQ tests before employing people... But so far I have not found this to be the case!!My conversation with Tina ended with me telling her not to bother and hanging up. I have had to ring E.on a few times recently and have always left the call feeling the same, after spending half an hour minimum on the phone waiting and then explaining and spelling out my problem to the person on the end of the phone! Usually to little success! I end up hanging up needing a very large glass of Rioja!Next step: Change supplier. Because these guys are run by people who realise that we cant go without gas and electricity and so rip them off, and represented by idiots who only care about getting their paycheck and going home. "
5018|Eon Electricity Bill often comes in wrong despite meter readings. Red Bill (chaser) comes in two days after actual bill, which is unreasonable and a collection agency letter a week after the chaser even though you already paid. I know they run a business and times are hard, but I do not intend to spend every evening paying bills, which they seem to expect one to do if their debtor collection system is geared on 7 day receipt of payment. It seems to me that I have to drop everything the minute I get a bill and get straight onto my internet banking and run my life around them. Yet it is acceptable for them to take a few weeks to correct the bill on the first place and it is meant to be their job.Also collection letter was unreasonable since I have been with them for a number of years and was never late or in arrears. Was not late this time eighter paid the bill three days after the receipt. What a waste of resources.I was outraged and switched. So should everyone.
5019|I took a EON dual energy offer on August last year. They estimated it to be 154 pounds/month. Already from the very first bill it started to show that these monkeys cannot even calculate their estimates correctly. After half a year I terminated the contract when the original estimate was almost reached. This estimate was for whole year worth of energy consumption. I used the real consumption values to get offers from other energy companies and to my surprise I got the monthly payments down by 50% compared to the one given by the EON. Stay away of this company. They rip you off.   
5020|"Only giving 1 start cause 0 stars are not an option. After being called from one of the people who work with eon, i signed up in July 2011, since then, took me 6 months & 3 phone calls to see what my bill was as had not received an online or paper bill within this time. Paying GBP60 a month for dual fuel. Got my bill 6 months later (feb 2012), had GBP75 in credit, though ""great, just what i need to pay for food shopping"". (im a mother of one with not alot of money).. They CHARGED ME for refunding my money to me, upped my direct debit to GBP77 per month. I Agreed, had to to get my money. Then suddenly, 2 months on, i have an email stating my bill was ready to view online (they don't do paper bills)... read it, they are upping my direct debit AGAIN to GBP93 a month!! & (this just gets better)... apparently i used GBP443 worth of Gas in 2 months......It's APRIL. It's not the warmest but it's not exactly December!& after my last bill, money in credit came off & i still owe them GBP260 after that bill.. how do they expect me to afford that?I'm trying to leave, but nothing out there is much better to be honest. I'm disgusted. I was happy with the offer on the phone, only to be drawn into a GBP93 a month GBP500 every 2 months bill ON TOP. :( Bullies. They pick on the vulnerable ones!"
5021|I switched to E.ON in Summer 2011 for my gas from Npower because E.on had a longer capped price period than Npower. Theire Age UK April 2013 product seemed ideal for me butafter recieving my first statement for E.ON I found the account to be in debit. Since then my account has mostly been in debit. I find E.on's rewards to be virtually non existent becaus I do not qulaify for Tesco Club Card Points because I am only with E.on for gas. I do get around 6% reward for paying by direct debit but this adds up to less than Npower's generous GBP55.00 per year for gas by direct debit. E.on do give a coldweather payment of GBP10.00 but this is nothing to shout about. The change over from Npower to E.on for my gas also went smoothly with E.on keeping me regularly updated in the switching process.      One positive aspect to E.on is that they do provide me with 3 monthly statements for gas. THis is better than Npower's 6 monthly statements. In all I mfind E.on to be qute expensive compared with Npower and will look to change to another supplier once the capped period ends. 
5022|DO NOT JOIN E.ON! Im a single mother with a young child my time too is extremely precious . And I was horrified when I was contacted by a 3rd Party Debt collection agency stating I owed them GBP200. When I lived at my previous address I paid by direct debit every month on a set rate that the checked to ensure I did not go over. Even a simple thing like that is difficult for eon.But getting to the point E.on BREAK THE DATA PROTECTION ACT ON NUMEREOUS OCCASIONS AND PASS OUT OUR AND YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION LIKE SWEETS!!  They never made any effort to contact me what so ever but felt it was ok to go straight to a debt collection agency and my previous landlord to whom these are both 3rd parties.I was a loyal honest customer who always pays their bills. I paid GBP200 whilst living at my previous property and they stated I owed them an additional GBP200  I was only living there for 3 months and I never had the heating (immersion heater) or electric heating on EVER as I was barley there! and there trying to say i used GBP400 of energy in 3 months !In my new property im with SSE and I cannot go over GBP20 a month in eletric!!!Then I looked the the letter again they were trying to charge me for next doors energy, I told them I didnt live there but beacause an A property as in Flat 3, 8A address they just removed the A from the bill and tried to pass it off as mine!! Im currently having to dispute this!! its ridiculus!Anyway when i left I gave them my forwarding address and meter readings when I left , and finalised the account yet they some how lost this information as they cannot provide it. surprise surprise.And the customer service is a EPIC FAIL the dont know anything about MPAN no.(meter box number)  Readings, Location of properties etc. They are trying to charge me for somewhere ive never lived and Im having to waste me time and effort and money into contacting them and I never get a straight answer or any evidence or proof!!Bottom line: THEY DONT CARE WHO PAYS THE BILL ASLONG AS SOMONE DOES! this is sick but true dont fall into their trap!!!I believe this needs to be taken to the energy watch dog team as enough is enough .
5023|All seemed well with Eon at first but it just turned into a nightmare in a very short period of time. Customer service is schocking and charging customers GBP55 for a visit when no prior arrangements have been made (and your not in the property because your working), is daylight robbery and illegal
5024|"As it seems with many people on here and various other forums- we've had a lot of trouble leaving E-on. After leaving the company as there price plan was no longer competitive, we suddenly had GBP327 taken from my account as the ""final bill""! We've not had any notification of this and luckily there was just short of that in my account so my bank did not verify this. We had paid direct debits to avoid large bills. However, trying to understand where this money had come from took a very long time. The first person we spoke to was rude and uninformative. We were told it was just the final meter reading and that was that. Awful service, with no outcome just yet and lots of money spent on calling them! "
5025|"Could somebody up there in e-on land please teach your door to door reps that NO does mean NO.  Not only did it take me a good twenty minutes to get rid of them the first time they called, but they had the affront to call again yesterday (20/3/2012) with the same old waffle. Come on e-on I thought cold calling was a thing of the past.  Your reps seemed so desperate to get me to sign up, they were starting to verge on rudeness because I was'nt interested, with the parting shot of ""Well it's your loss"".  I DONT' THINK SO!  More like e-on's. Because of their behaviour, even if I did consider changing to them I would'nt after the encounter with their reps."
5026|E.ON: terrible, terrible, terrible service.I have been with E.ON for about a year and nine months now and I have had many problems with them making mistakes, giving me confusing and incoherent information and making simple things complicated.Today they gave their best performance.They called me regarding a flat that I left a year ago and claimed that I had not given my final meter readings and they proceeded to contact my previous landlord.  Once they received the readings they informed me of the fact that I OWED THEM GBP895 (for energy that I used a year and half ago).I explained to them several times that those numbers did not make any sense and something somewhere had to be wrong.  After a day going through old bills, looking for a way to blame myself for what was happening and speaking over the phone I about to give up when that brilliant person that my girlfriend is came home.She called them back and they started going through my account and soon it came out that I owed them an additional GBP530, bringing the total amount of money that THEY WERE ASKING ME FOR GBP1425.  My girlfriend had the patience to question them about everything and spent 57 minutes and 34 seconds going through everything with them.IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY OWE ME GBP5.  IT WAS ALL A FAULT ON THEIR PART.I could go on for pages about how they could have handled the situation better in many points, but I think you get the picture.This is not the first time that they make colossal mistakes.  I am self employed, my time is precious and every minute that I spend chasing their errors is a minute that I am not earning a penny.  The problems that they have caused in multiple occasions are a loss to me.I am also questioning the honesty of their errors: don't forget that I was about to hand over the money... that did not belong to them!  How many other people have just gone well, I'll just have to accept you are right, here are GBPXXXX?  It seems just too easy.DON'T TRUST E.ON.  THEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF YOUR TIME.
5027|We just left and found they give lots of different bills for same period. The customer service is terrible and they rip you off when leaving. Avoid them
5028|Having had a direct debit set up throughout my tenancy for them to collect their money monthly, as I have done everywhere I've lived for the past 10 years with complete success, I have now moved out of the property and they sent me a demand for GBP600 for electric! In a house with gas heating/cooker, no electric shower, energy saving lightbulbs and a TV that was only turned on once a week they are now asking for more money than I have paid British Gas for the gas that we'd used lots of! Not only that, the demand for money arrived whilst I was on my honeymoon and when I called them to discuss it they say that it is already with debt collectors (10 days after the letter was sent). This is a disgusting company and I will never go near them again.  
5029|Moved into a new-build property, as first tenant, in october. As soon as i paid my first electric bill to EON, they started sending me letters and threatening to send debt collectors to my house over a GBP60 from July. i spoke to them several times and emailed them and ended up getting numerous phone calls from a debt collection company. on investogating, EON said they received my name in July (i was not in the country from april-august???) from someone named Bonnie who does not work for them.??  Baffled?? me too. They will falsify information and pester you whether you owe them or not. I can not imagine how many vulnerable people have lost money to this scam run by EON. Check the minor details!!!
5030|We've been with won in our rented property for a number of years and have had no problems at all. That said the bills come through quarterly and I pay online within the week. So far so good. I have always sung their praises to friends and family. The last bill came through in December and due to being away my payment ended up clearing the day after their payment date. Computer generated or not the letter we recieved was pretty strong and a bit over the top really. I guess if you pay on time and their admin is on the ball then you're fine. We just have electric and it's been reasonable in terms of cost compared to others. We bought our first property a couple of years ago to get on the housing ladder. It required a complete refurb and we undertook this because it was still cheaper than a deposit we would've had to find on a new place. Unlucky for us, it has pre payment meters!We were with Scottish power for about 2 years but changed before all the tariffs were due to rise last year. I have always wanted these rip offs removed and was led up the garden path with Scottish power, first saying we had to be with them 6 months, then a year and so on. Anyway the same thing is happening with Ron. 6 months then a year. We've just passed the 6 month month point and I have no doubt that in a year they'll change the goal posts. For electric it's almost 30p a day standing charge on the meter. I just find this unbelievable really. Along with that (bearing in mind the house is empty) we received a bill for over GBP200. Because we hadn't sent a meter reading ( we weren't asked for one) the computer estimated it. I phoned and explained Again the house was empty and they had no right estimating bills. The response was very matter of fact that they needed a meter reading. Fine but the reading was obviously going to be the same as last time because nothing had been used, I mean how stupid. Again I asked about having the meters removed and was told it would be GBP51 per meter. I said that in theory come the next quarter I will have paid that anyway almost in standing charges. The woman just wasn't getting it and tried to say that I would pay about the same in standing charges anyway. Really?I've come to the conclusion that these meters are just an easy gravy train for these companies. I really feel for those who are stuck with them and I dread to think what they pay for fuel over the year. I am very wary of them now and will be looking to change soon. 
5031|"E-on are totally incapable of sending out my bills and I only ever receive final reminders. Due to their mistake I am now in debt with them for over GBP500. I have had no apology; only some half-wit on the phone that keeps repeating the same phrase of: ""it must have got lost in admin"". Changing supplier as soon as I have sorted out a way to pay back the money which they are also very unhelpful with. I keep receiving a letter saying ""we are changing your direct debit to GBP385.00 a month"" even though I was told my direct debit had been cancelled. I ending up cancelling the direct debit myself, have made a complaint and now they are just going to have to wait for the money. This is a company of bullies!"
5032|i moved into a new rented property and wanted to go with dual fuel as i was with different providers for gas and electric - i thought eon had a good tariff so went with them.BUT they took the gas from the flat downstairs twice and took 6 months to sort out - they then got in contact telling me i was GBP300 in debt because THEY couldnt bill me for electric as i was on a duel fuel plan - so why do I have to pay it when it was their complete stupidity that landed me in the mess, i am forced to pay GBP93 a month (i am disabled to thats a whack out of my benefit) and was since told that i am only paying off a very small amount and if i was to keep my usage to GBP60 a month i would pay it off quicker... REALLY??? Saveonline9 - not really saving????i then got a further letter telling me i was $99 in debt so they was going to up my direct debit to GBP95 a month.....hand on i was sure i was GBP300 in debt???? so i rang them and they said ' all they can see is i am GBP99 in debt - to which my reply was  - GBPso how come i can see the now figure of GBP405 pound on my online account  but you can only see GBP99!debt clear?? Hell no - im still battling with them as why should i have to pay off the debt when it is their fault i am in so much debt. al because they couldnt do a simple switch..stay far far away from EON you get more hassle then its worth and like me you dont need a constant headache from it.
5033|"Just switching supplier because of the appalling customer service - when you say you thinking of moving they are are all over you like a rash, but when you outline the issues, they still don't get resolved.  Get told by a specific person that they will ring you back, but they never do - then you repeat the same process again again.  This has happened three times and this is just this week, and its only thursday!  They employ a lot of ""should have"" and ""shouldn't haves"" in the organisation -  this person should have done this, this person shouldn't have done that - left hand doesn't have a clue what the right one is doing.  Up there with Talk Talk.  Avoid EON - I will never use them again."
5034|I have just left E-on after 8 months. In September they rang me to let me know that they were taking GBP190 from my Direct Debit. The problem was that I didn't hear the call because I am deaf! ANY way they took GBP190 out in September, October, November and December. I asked for the money back, but other than the December overpayment I have not received it. I have cancer, so that may be my last Christmas so I was hoping to make it a good one, but with a lack of money, it was not. I have asked the energy ombudsman to look into the matter, and have switched to OVO Energy, which seems to me much cheaper (I hope)Although it supposed to be an internet account, it is not very friendly. They sent me email from a DO NOT REPLY box, so I usually had to reply by post: it would have been good to know this in advance.Peter Duncan
5035|We are letting our property, the letting agency sent eon a copy for the rental agreement. After 5 month later, I receive mail from eon for final payment. I therefore contacted eon, they told me they never received the rental contract. The letting agent resent the contract by email and fax again, I contacted eon again, they told me they hadn't received it. I then received a demand letter from eon's enforcement company, I told them all about and we then sent the rental contract again, I had to repeat it 3 times.Eventually they received the contract and recalculated the invoice. I made payment, two days later the enforcement company sent me a letter requesting payment with a 20% discount. I contacted them, but because I made full payment, I did not receive the 20 % discount. There charges are huge, compare to the company I use for my private home. The property was empty, but they telling me the cost is double to the house I live in with my family. There customer relationship is very disappointing. There are very good electricity companies out there, who are happy for your custom.
5036|I was being billed for gas i was not using as i moved out of a property and into a new one, E.on kept billing me for months after and threatened to take me to court if i did not pay.I contacted a company called ComplaintsForYou and they managed to sort the problem out, i feel like i have one over on them now. They deal with all sorts so i suggest anyone on here that is having a hard time give them a try on 0800 2289 041
5037|please keep away from e.on energy suppliers they try and charge you for gas and elc you have not used i have been trying for 2 months to give them the right readings only to be sent a leter saying we are going to pass your account to a debt collection unless the balance is paid in full i keep telling them the readings are wrong and you are chargeing me for elc i have not used but i cant get any were with them
5038|whatever you do DONY use eon for any fuel supplyhaving been a customer with them for 2 years, i finally gave up trying and switched to COOPERATIVE energy; friendly, helpful, and much cheaper.eon took 1 year to get my account right, couldnt find my meter anywhere on the energy system; sent my email account bills to a wrong email address for 6 months; sent a baliff to the house UNNOTIFIED to collect a bill I hadnt recieved; etc etc etc; then they have the nerve to deny all these thing occured becouase ' computer says it never happened'DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR, SAVE YOURSELF SOME HASSLE, DONT SIGN UP FOR EON!!!!
5039|I have a rented house that e-on supply the gas to. i did not authorise them to change meters the tenant did , i knew nothing about this until i got a bill for GBP126 for gas used at the address when it was actually empty !!!! On looking into this the logical answer is that the tenant took and supplied the wrong meter readings when she changed meters. E-ons response ? Im now threatened that unless i pay the bill i will be taken to court with increased costs and given a ccj. how can this be allowed to happen ? I havent authorised them to change the meter havent used any gas or electric in the property as i dont live there and the time scale that they are claiming GBP126 for the property was empty !!!!See you in court e-on.
5040|Talked into joining E-on by someone standing in the street?! Worst day of my life to say the least. I joined them and started paying my GBP30 a months gas whoo hoo much cheaper than my usual gas company.....for the first 6weeks!! I then get a phone call and they tell me they have to increase my Direct Debit as i'm using more gas than they thought?! Wow it's July not using my heating and i have no gas cooker yet they want to raise my DD to GBP125 a month??!! GBP100 pound increase which since i had only just lost my job i couldn't afford to pay. GBP125 month for a 4 bedroom house??Little gas no gas fire no gas cooker? is this normal?Anyway after my debt slowly increased as i struggled to pay, they finally bullied me into getting a meter installed (YES BULLIED) threatened with police and social workers! I agreed to get the meter installed and it's fails every other day. CALL HELP comes up on the meter and we are left with no gas. Most of the time over night and even with a disabled daughter they will still not send anyone out as there is never anyone available. No help from them when I call.  Sick of them!!! Stay clear!!!
5041|I am currently on Scottish Power in my rented flat.  When calling them to enquire about how to terminate the account, they answered almost immediately.Now calling E.On because that's the supplier for the new flat.  I have chosen the option for new customers (which usually gets you through faster since they want you to sign up) but have so far been waiting 15 mins for someone to reply.If they treat prospective customers like this I dread to think how you are treated once you've signed up.Will be switching a.s.a.p after moving in!
5042|I am currently being over charged by eon, trying to say my usage is GBP106 a month when last year was less and the recent meter readings online are saying my usage has gone down by 73%Customer service sucks
5043|We have just purchased a property and have the misfortune to have to try to ring Eon with the meter readings as the previous owners were supplied electric and gas by them.  2 days later and we're still no nearer getting through.  I used to like Pachalbel's Canon but having listened to it on and off over the past 2 days whilst being left endlessly on 'hold' it is now grating on me.  Hope they ask if we'd like them as our supplier because they'll be told in no uncertain terms what we think of their appalling customer service.  Have never had this problem with Atlantic.....
5044|I have been with Eon for about 2-3 years now, always had problems that could not be resolved. Tried to contact them and the customer service is the worse I have ever experienced. I have been charged many times for something that I should not pay because of their mess on the system. I could never resolve that as they never answer the phone!!! Why should the customer pay for the phone call if the company makes mistakes?! 
5045|I have tried calling eon customer service twice today .... first time waited 20 minutes and did not get anywhere... second time I had waited for 40 minutes. I had then found a phone number on the bill about complaints .... no one answered and I was on hold again. As a last resort I then decided to call the directors offices ... by which time I was furious .... I mean 60 minutes calling from a mobile to 0845 number is NOT cheap!! a very pleasant man called Simon answered after two rings! at the end of the call he offered me a FIVER! erm NO!!! its going to cost me at least GBP20 for all this?!! My final point is this if not for a card electricity meter I would move to another company ... as my gas is with utility warehouse and they are great! I had felt soooo strongly about this that it forced me to make a review on this website ... something that I have NEVER done in my entire life. I am deeply disappointed.Miss Lauksmina Giedraityte.
5046|Been trying to get through to eon since last thursday 3 x daily at 30 mins each time off my mobile ( which isnt free) to keep been told they are experiencing high volume calls rang the complaint number tonite for it too ring once and someone to anwser and deal with my question.. Some service when you have too ring the complaint number..My advice DONT GO WITH EON!!! ID RATHER LIGHT MY HOUSE WITH CANDLES!!!
5047|I've tried to phone their customer contact number morning, noon and night, but it always says it is experiencing high call volumes and warns of a long wait.....this company doesn't deserve any customers!I used to be with first utility who couldn't be easier to deal with. I'm now trying to get back to them.
5048|It is a nightmare trying to get through to their customer service team on the phone.  Once you get through they are quite helpful. The cost of phoning them is ridiculously high!  I resorted to emailing them with my queries & complaints, I received a response from them a few days later & granted the response was useful & detailed, they said they'd send a revised bill taking into account the credit I was due, bill came through, credit not even mentioned.  Clicked reply on their email but oh no you can't do it that way you have to go through the website email again! Before I received 2nd reply from them I got a letter demanding I pay my bill, this letter had taken into account my credit due!They are so unorganised & their bills are far too complicated.I am now in the process of switching and cannot wait to be rid of e.on! I am waiting & worrying about them throwing a spanner in the works with my switch, I do not trust them at all.
5049|i think its disgusting how Eon as a company can trap existing customers who they say have a debt with them, i am an eon customer and i apparently have a debt with them, im on a pre payment meter charging a daily service charge, intially when i rang them i only wanted to swap to avoid these charges as i use little to no electric and dont see why i should pay for a service im not using. Eon refuses to swap the pre payment meter, and their advisor on the phone said i could swap to another supplier if i chose, be given a final bill and that would be that, except when i did try to swap to another supplier Eon refused to let me
5050|Rang up to discuss why my previous landlord had misread the meters so it looked like I owed money. Spoke to a lad who sounded about 12 who spoke to me in such a rude manner I complained. He basically refused to pass me to a manager, said 'its there in black and white' over and over again when he could not answer my questions. . Then told me it was for gas charges before we ended the tenancy-GBP500 in 2 weeks! I dont think so. AWFUL.
5051|I would never use this company again. They installed a faulty powercard meter which ran up a debt of GBP2000+, they then replaced it and set it so high I keep running out of gas and trying to understand the meter is a joke. I offered to pay by direct debit to reduce the debt but they categorically refuse, even though I work fulltime and it would be so much simpler for everyone. But, EOn seem to enjoy being bullies.
5052|As a tenant, I wanted to discuss about a bill during a time which was unoccupied and I found the customer service appaling and truly horrible. Comments like you provided the meter reading on so-so date and how am I suppose to know why the charges are such as I don't live in the property is uncalled for. Moreover when I asked whether future payments can be made by someone else (and the reason I asked is to confirm that payments are not associated with a specific debit/credit card details for potential tenants), the sales rep cheekily answered 'Well if you could find someone else to pay your gas bill, by all means'. Unnecessary and utterly unsatisfactory!  
5053|I have been with eon for over 3 years and i have found it better than any supplier ive been with before. The online access is very simple to use and very easy to update your account without having to contact the customer services. Bills have been correct and easy to understand also you can collect Tesco Points which is very handy for the weekly shop!!Would recomend to anyone.
5054|I have never been treated like that in my life!Not sending any EON bills during my tenancy agreement(not even information)and 3 year after that I have been hounded by the debt recovery company BCW hired by EON Energy for a bill of GBP 230 plus admin cost of GBP 50. Unbelievable! It's not everything! after moving out in 2008 only few days ago I received another letter from BCW / EON sent to my existing home address!! for new debt of GBP 230 for the period from 2008 to 2011!!!! such a company? Just to clarify I had 'a pay as you go' tariff on EON meter topping up whenever credit runs out leaving me in darkness without electricity whenever on very rare occasions I forgot to top up- even then EON were giving us credit of up to GBP5 to be taken off the same day when new credit was topped up. I have asked BCW to put my case on hold after explaining the situation and they said I have to pay even though I have never signed the contract with them. They still keep calling me sending annoying letters, emails, leaving voice mails. RIDICULOUS! I tried to call EON few time but guess what? system was down so they weren't able to help asking to call back as it doesn't matter it is EON who made a lot of mistakes and got a mess in their head offices! After informing them it cost me money and it is their fault, rude consultant told me I you will be chased by BCW!!!. Queuing for hours wasting my time with credit running out quickly ended in bill of about GBP 30 just for calling EON queuing and being informed system is down. Let alone my credit score suffered as well whenI am applying for a mortgage. Until this has been sorted out they won't be able to remove it which in the end will show in the credit history. DON'T SIGN WITH EON otherwise you will be on their debt list for the whole life time. NEVER EVER I want to close to them.m
5055|We left a property on june 5th 2011 - we left GBP41 in credit with our energy provider E-on. August 2011 we recieve a notice from a debt collection agency saying we owe E-on GBP200. We call both E-on and the debt collection agency and are told that we owe money from june until august even though we told E-on we moved on the day we did so. After several days of constant phone calls this turned out to be an error on E-ons part, they admitted this and told us that it was all sorted, no need to worry.A month later (today)  we recieve a final notice asking for this money or they will refer us to a debt collection agency (again?). Hopefully they will resolve it this time (my partner is on the phone now in a quue) but this is very very poor customer service and I will NEVER use E-on again. 
5056|I pay direct debit monthly not on estimates but on actual readings as I never want to be owing any money as we are on a tight budget.  We came to leave the property and they sent me a bill for GBP500.  I asked them how this could happen when I pay dd on actual readings not estimates.  They said it was because they had put the wrong meter in (their fault), and that it was calculating on the wrong tarrif, I asked them to put it in writing.  I then received letters from bailifs, I responded saying that I would pay but in installments.  I set up payment plan then had subsequent calls saying I they had no record and that I needed to do it again, they are truly rubbish.Sally Greensall
5057|Earlier this year I received a bill for over GBP1600 from eon. I was a customer of theirs for about 6 months, over 6 years ago and have not been ever since. During this time we paid our bills in full.I phoned them and was asked to check my gas meter number against the bill. It did not match, but they were not satisfied. I had to give them another number from the meter which they said matched their records. After various phone calls I was told it had been a mistake and we would receive no further correspondence.I have received approximately 8 further letters from them including a letter threatening bailiff action and a call from the bailiffs. After each correspondence I have contacted eon to complain and EVERY time I have been told 'sorry it was a mistake on our part' and 'you will not be contacted again'.Some of the letters refer to different account numbers so now they have my name they are able to attach it to any account they like? They have offered a measly GBP15 compensation for the phone calls I have made but nothing for the stress incurred (which was awful the day I was expecting bailiffs at my home).Apparently it is all sorted now and we should receive nothing further from them. But we got another letter this morning...
5058|I have been with E'on for several years, I am an avid switcher of utlity providers so keep a check on prices but because their service has always been good for me I have stayed with them even though maybe I could save a few quid elsewhere. Quick to respond to queries, easy to use account management online where you can track energy usage, check bills & give meter readings, you can also see other products available if you want to switch to something more suitable. I also receive Tesco clubcard points which I can (currently) exchange for vouchers to use to pay E'on! Am happy with E'On and would recommend them.  
5059|Avoid E.on at all costs.  Have received a bill for over GBP9500 for 3 months worth of electricty. When they were contacted I was advised to take meter readings which I did for 2 weeks.  Turned out meter was faulty and had been since December 2010 took another 2 weeks before they would sort meter.  I have contacted Customer services several times-16 phone calls, 1 complaint email and one complaint letter (letter and email still not aswered).  All phone calls told something different.Now been advised that it will take another 4-6 weeks to get sorted, this is totally shocking when they have made a big error.  They dont care about how someone feels, and the worry this is causing.I WOULD STRONGLY AVOID E.ON.
5060|Warning to those who have Eon boiler cover and move house.We have had Eon 50 boiler cover (means GBP50 callout charge - but cheaper product) we had been reasonably happy with the cover (apart from one hiccough!) until we moved house. Originally I was told that the existing policy could simply be transferred to the new house. (we were in month 10 of a 12 month policy) As we were planning to get a new boiler for the new house I was not really interested in a long contract. to my surprise, Eon sent me a letter with a new 12 month contract for the new house. when I rang them (required multiple phone calls to a 0845 number over 2 days- arghh!) they told me that I had to take out a new 12 month contract , otherwise they would not cover the boiler in the new house. I was annoyed because this was not what I had understood when I had rang them about moving house. I was told that Eon always says that their contracts are 12 months. However, I pointed out that I was not told that I would have to take out a NEW 12 month contract - and the Eon person had the audacity to say that they don't have to tell me that I would end up taking out a new 12 month contract with them!They now sent me a bill for the last month of the old 12 month contract, even though this refers to the old house. So they are charging me for a service in the old house, even though I don't live there anymore! I don't think this is right.so beware! I actually think that they are in breach of their own terms and conditions because nowhere does it say that if you move house you have to take out a new 12 month contract with them or have to pay off the old contract in full!I think this is problematic and unethical behaviour by a big utility company as you are either being forced to pay something for nothing (ie pay for cover for the old property where you don't live anymore; or pay hefty cancellation fee of GBP75) or are forced to take out a new 12 month policy with them.So if you know that you may be moving house soon, I strongly advise you to check what the company is going to do when you move. 
5061|Moved into a newbuild home which already had its supply connected to E.ON, it took them 5 months to get our account set up with E.ON and that was after   15 Phonecalls 5 E-mails 4 Official Complaints 1 Letter to Complaints Director (unanswered)  We finally got our first energy bill which told us we owed them GBP900 for 5 months energy usage. After giving them meter readings they recalculated this to GBP150 which I think is a bit off from what they thought it could be.   It took a further 2 calls another e-mail and another complaint to actually attribute this amount to our account rather than the GBP900. An absolute travesty of an organisation that I thankfully won't have to deal with ever again very soon. Don't touch them with a barge pole. 
5062|"I pay GBP105 per month for dual fuel and received a Direct DEbit amendment for GBP3017.00 PER MONTH !!!!!  When I called them they asked me to call them back with meter readings .. it was ""just a computer glitch"" I said no way they can call me back.  I had received a letter which could have given me a heart attack on the bank holiday weekend when they were shut.   I had to contact my bank to put a hold on the direct debit and they want me to call them back.  Rubbish service .. they need to look up the word customer."
5063|Having been with eon at my old address ....changed home advised Eon that need to stay with the supplier for a term after nearly an hours call from an operator have no choice but to stay 28dayus with eon as they changed because we had an outstanding bill ... We did ask for outstanding bill when we moved no mail from them ..... disgusted at their tactics.. Be very careful 
5064|Moved into a 1 bed flat in centre of warrington at end of 2008 (i didnt know e-on where the suppliers at first as it was my first flat since moving out. went to check the mail box and there where 7 red letters for the previous tenant to pay what he owed the company it totalled to 400 pounds. i gave the letters to my landlady to sort out and she said id still have to pay them because apparently they go off future readings etc and what id probably use. (these letters where from beginning of middle of 2008 before i moved in when a tenant was there. so i waited and went with spark energy the switch over went perfect. a few months later i got a letter saying theyd take me to court for non payment of the previous bills plus get this my usgae for when i moved in to when spark took over was nearly 500 pounds (150 pounds a month it worked out at which is ridiculous with just a tv running, e-on said if i send my tenancy agreement in to prove i moved in when i said i did i wouldnt have to pay so i sent it off.  few weeks later another court letter came through the door. so again i phoned e-on who said they hadnt recieved my agreement. (it was in front off them because they told me different 5 mins later. but even still id have to pay for someone elses bill. so i emailed the manager off e-on and he phoned me and went through my problem and still said id have to pay but as a gesture of good will i could pay the bill off at 50 pound a month (because they go off what a persons likely to use in future but how can they know that if i wasnt living there and the bills where addressed to the occupier before i lived there they where actual red letters. . e-on are cheats and i urge noone to use this company.
5065|i was with eon before i switched to BG  i  had a key for elctric and card  for gas   but to my horrer recieved a quaterly bill for both  electric and gas in total  bills they sent me was GBP400 or just over  they told me it was  for gas i had used  after a while they sorted it out  and never owed them nothing as was on pay as you go electric and gas but took several months to sort out  switched to BG and had no problems at all with them
5066|"I inherited E.ON when I bought a flat. I immediately moved to switch to nPower for gas and electricity, which we use for all our other flats. Turns out that E.ON secretly registered the flat's electricity supply as ""business tariff"" with ECOES, a central registry for business customers. nPower say they can do nothing until E.ON release my account. E.ON tell me ""manage your account online"". Of course I can't do this online: it's either a scam, a reverse ""slam"" (a freeze to prevent switching) or total, absolute incompetence. I've already complained to the Energy Ombudsman but as they say they are overworked and behind on tasks I'll probably go to Small Claims Court in the next few days. I've already spent an outrageous amount of time trying to deal with this nasty firm."
5067|Quick at setting everything up when we moved into our property. Always quick to respond. Good customer service.
5068|Spent 3 years with them on business tariffs that were high cost and they didnt use their meter readings at all, just estimates. Consequently we got a surprise bill for GBP1200 on top of the GBP600 normal quarter and they were surprised we didnt think it was right.  On top of that they credited off 3 years worth of bills and re-billed it all, in spite of me expressly saying not to do that. We have spent around 75 man hours adjusting ouraccounts to fit theirs. I have no idea how they think businesses can do that.
5069|Overall I have been really pleased with Eon despite the long delay of getting our gas & elec set up on one acct online. Once contacted, I received the following email a day later. I removed one star for the delay in the first place.  Not completely sure of value for money but I did quite a lot of comparison and Eon is where I ended up.  They make it very easy to send in your meter readings online.   Prior to this we had British Gas who used estimated readings despite me sending in our numbers and our first bill was a SHOCKING GBP400+ for just gas!!! My calculations it should have been less than half for the time period.  I had a similar experience with NPower prior to BT.   Email from Eon: Thank you for your email.  I am very sorry for the delay in getting your accounts combined. I can tell you that they are now linked. If you log in with your online username, you will be able to see both the gas and electricity.  The Direct Debit has also been amended, so that you pay one amount every month for both the gas and electricity. This will be GBP80 from the 4 April 2011. We will monitor this amount and you may see that it needs to increase or even decrease in the future.  I have also backdated a switch to SaveOnline 5 from the time your gas came over to us, which was 19 January 2011. To make sure you have been billed on the correct prices, I have re-billed your account. This will credit back around GBP10.  You may want to register for our free energy monitor.

5070|Moved into Flat 4 days ago needed a EON key for elec meter. Have been given 8 news agents to collect key from NOT ONE HAS KEY IN STOCK. No power for 4 days no help from useless Eon customer advisors. 
5071|Hi-  I have been with E.on for almost 4 years and continually check on websites that they are the cheapest provider for me.  I have moved tariff 3 times to make sure i am on theitr cheapest deals as they have always been the top provider for me.  Also, for me to move from E.On I have to say that the saving woudl have to be huge as the service has been excellent and the process of billing and payments was much better than with my previous supplier.
5072|I have been with Eon dual fuel for 3 years (switched from BG) Have always found their website easy to use to switch deals. They have always been competitively priced. If you don't regularly check utility prices it's your own fault if you get fleeced. As for boiler care I stopped using BG they were cowboys, feedback from neighbours is not good for Eon. Now use Barclays bank account deal.
5073|I'd moved into a new home back in July 2010, Eon were already supplying the gas and electric. I called up to give them my details  and they advised me to sign on with them it would cost me 200 GBP. I explained I would look for another supplier as I couldn't justify the amount. They still needed to take my bank details for payment of what I had used.   I've changed to another supplier however in December my bank has advised me Eon set up a direct debit and had been taking 50 pounds a month. I managed to get the direct debit cancelled and got the money back, however Eon has now set up another direct debit with a different reference number. As they used a different reference number, my bank were unable to stop this from being set up again. When you cancel your account make sure you tell your bank to put a block on them and not just cancel the direct debit!
5074|"DO NOT USE! I stupidly transferred to Eon after being assured by the ""lovely"" chap that came to my door that my electricity/gas would cost GBP40 per month combined. Gullible I know. I recently received a letter from them telling me ny direct debit payments would increase to GBP340 A MONTH because of the arrears accrued. They were most unhelpful when I phoned explaining the least I could pay a month was GBP130! Couldnt be done. Take care. They only want you to sign up and will quote unrealistic prices to ensure this. Once theyve got you in debt, youre stuck! I borrowed cash just to get rid. Immoral selling!"
5075|After being fleeced for over a year in a duel fuel contract. Eon decided in their wisdom that they were going to charge me GBP30 because I moved supplier. My contract came to an end 28th Feb - my move was 22nd Feb. I am aware they were within their rights to charge this amount (for less than a week!).... perhaps it might be a better idea to waive this amount presuming I may return to Eon at some future date? I rang. Computer says 'no'... Overpriced and useless customer service. Don't use them.
5076|Do not use E On for Central Heating Care.  My heating stopped working over Christmas and was told it wasn't an emergency as we had an electric fire in the house so could sleep in the lounge and a standard call out would be booked - for 6 days later! They blamed the severe weather for the long wait.  Heating has broken down again, no hot water or heating, called them for an emergency call out and have been told again it's not an emergency so it will be a standard call out of 6 days! When I asked what was classed as an emergency I was told if we had water escaping in the property it would be an emergency.  I've had to call a plumber, can't live in the cold again for almost a week.  I'm going to Ofgen - had enough of them taking my money for nothing
5077|Eon are terrible. I live in a one bed tiny flat, work full-time and are out and about on a weekend. They sent me a bill for a quarter for GBP511.99. They are useless at rectifying this problem and have just kept us on hold for far too long. Do not get your energy through this company. They screw you over.
5078|I have been with e.on for about 18 months now, on a dual fuel, internet billing and monthly D.D. agreement. I have not had a scrap of bother with them and when I rang them the other day to discuss a new contract I was put through very quickly to an adviser who was professional and helpful as well as being honest. I will most likely be going to EDF as they have a 4.5yrs fixed product which suits our needs but if e.on had the same product I'd stay with them, no problem. I don't leave reviews very often but when I saw the amount of people who have had negative experiences I thought I should show that there is another side to the matter. hope this helps someone overwhelmed with the negative response. I am retired and have no connection at all to e.on.
5079|Dont Use EON, rubbish!!
5080|I'm a landlord of a property where the tenants have just moved out having changed the gas and electric to pre-payment meters without my authorisation.  I have been told  1) I would be charged GBP51 for the removal of the prepayment meter 2) I should pay off the previous tenants debt 3) I have to sign a guarantor to ensure future payment 4) I would be charged GBP2 for a credit check  My the best option is to pay GBP51 and change company. The company is scandalous 
5081|We have the full Central Heating care with Eon as well as a dual fuel tariff. We had our annual service done on the heating system and a small leak was dedected on the boiler along with a stuck valve on a radiator. An engineer was booked to repair said issues. The engineer arrived as planned and after 5 minutes of working on the radiator he broke the thermostat valve (which was not the one at fault) and water all over the carpet with a chorus of f**king hells and other swear words. He the moved onto the boiler once the leak was temporary fixed. He the made a small leak into a big leak and said he need new parts. 1 month on and around 30 phone calls 4 cancelled visits I am still without hot water and heating. They honestly haven't a clue what they are doing, there is no coordination, the engineer we witnessed was useless at best with a foul mouth and they do not understand the concept of customer service. I now await an engineer this afternoon after being promised one this morning who was cancelled without me knowing again. If this one does not turn up then I have warned them to expect to see me at their offices in Nottingham and I will not be removed unless by the police by which time I will have already contacted the local news. Please do yourself a favour if you are not with Eon yet and don't even go there. If you are with Eon for your fuel then please do not touch their heating care products as you are throwing money down the drain
5082|In all my life of living their has NEVER been a company that has daily dominated mylife whereby everyday i contemplate whether to continue living than i have with EON. Ever since they came into existant , they have become one of the most callous, money hungry , uncompassionate company i have ever had the bad fortunate to come across  was moved to EON through no choice of my own . The first year was not to bad as when i was in employment a direct debit was setup and it was agreed the company could take GBP35 a week from my wages. Because i was so busy i didnt realise that i had eventually overpaid them . I was not notified of this and when i approached EON they was reluctant to reimburse me for the payment. I consquently later last my job so was unable to maintain payment as regular . Annoyed by this EON then blackmailed me into installing a meter . Once installed they let rip, but taking even possible advantage they could. They claim to people whom i have complained to that they only charge me GBP3.00 a week when infact in actuality they charge me a whole lot more as my payment to them each which is between GBP30-40 ( for both gas meter and electricity).  I explained to them that i am in receipt of JSA of GBP50 a week and struggle to pay other creditors and buy food because they are ripping into me and forcing me into poverty. All i was met with was a condescending reply and failures to reassist the situation Today i was forced to make a call an 0845 number from my friends phone because i was not able to get any gas. The meter would not allow me to click the reset button once i had topped the card up , which meant i could not get any hot water. I made a call to EON and had never encountered a bunch of mentally challenged staffs in my life. The first guy had literally repeated my postcode to me in a very slow and complicated manner as if he was trying to repeat to himself because he was having difficulty processing a simple postcode. The two further staffs again could not comprehend simple english. I had to repeat my postcode to them on three occasions and each time NONE of them comprehended what i requested , which was to ask if an engineer to come out.. I called a further time just to check whether the job had been booked because i was not confident that it would be done and low and behold . It was not .I was put on hold for nearly 15 mins while they try to phone through to an engineer JUST to book one to come out. I had NEVER come across a bunch of enepted individuals in my life. My whole relationship with EON has been an extreme resentful one and im frustrated with the fact that i cannot get rid of them. They have caused me nothing but emotional and physical stress throughout the years and continue to do to date. At times i feel that i just wanna end it all because they are a share blackhole in my life. Their share greed has desenstise themselves to humans and the everyday financial struggles we have. EON is fake in their responsibility to customer care and become nothing but money hungry sharks in my opinion.  
5083|Terrible rude customer service, 3 words 'DONT USE EON' enough said.
5084|I have made numerous complaints to e.on energy. This is one of them: I have been suffering with out hot water and central heating from the 4/01/2011. I had made a complaint about this recently.I was expecting a mechaninc to have fixed the boiler by 2pm today but instead have been waiting ever since! It is now 4pm and the customer service team have been of no assistance. They claim that the mechanic should have been here by 3.30. I am in no position to be dealing with high stress levels like this as i suffer with Angina. I can not understand why the mechanic has not yet arrived, all of my household duties have been put on hold and instead I have ben wasting my time waiting for someone to arrive. I feel as though my basic needs and circumstances are not being understood. I have a disabled son who needs to be in a warm and safe environment. Why is this not easy to understand? I am being denied my human rights and my son is being denied his. I am a paying customer and can not even be given adequate services! I am infuriated that I have had to wait for so long in the middle of a icey cold winter for a boiler to get fixed.  Every one is suffering in this family, we have to boil pans of water on the stove just to have a bath in the mornings. I have had to purchase mini heaters and even then, they are of little help. I have been made to suffer all this time and I am definately not a happy customer!! e. on energy is by far the worst company I have been with. 
5085|Ive been with the company since i moved into my house which was november 2009. I was paying an amount of GBP80 a month as we are never home so hardly use any electricity, we never use any gas throughout the year except for december when it gets cold and the central heating is on for 4hrs a day. I got told i was in credit around sept 2010 of around GBP400 so they dropped my payments to GBP70 per month. Now all of a sudden over december my electric bill is 286.38 gas is 205.40. How the hell can anyone use that amount in a month seriously?! absolutley ridiculous! Im phoning them tomorrow and recommend NOT!!!! to go with this company. They will have your pants down!!! 
5086|I took out Eon boiler care for piece of mind as described by their sales person,the service is pathetic,we have been without hot water and heating for 3 weeks now,we had 1 visit after 6 days,they just came to look at the boiler not to repair it,we have tried to contact Eon on numerous occasions to no avail its now Christmas Eve,no heating no hot water,and no idea when they might bother to call,AVOID AT ALL COST,THEY TAKE THE MONEY,THEY CANNOT PROVIDE A SERVICE.
5087|Terrible service, they came last week to fix my boiler, needed a part said they would come back the next day - they never turned up.  Heating broke again, have waited on phone for 70 minutes to get appointment.  Have no heating and hot water and young family.  Waited in all day and yet again have not turned up!  It really isn't good enough.  Called he cust services team and they aren't able to contact the engineer to even tell me if he is coming or not!!
5088|"customer service is appalling. I found their staff rude and patronizing. We have moved out of the property we rented at the end of August, paid what was meant to be the final bill and we thought the matter was closed. Agency we rented from were  happy with everything we did, including paid bills, so we received our deposit no problem. Three months later I received, without any prior warning, ""a final demand for payment"", E.On claimed we owed them money and that they contacted me via an email.Cheeky. Apparently the agency moving out readings did not match with what we paid. After many phone calls later, both to our former agency and E.On themselves, it turned out that the person that took our final reading from us did not process it. Apparently, we have been paying only estimate bills since May. Never mind I called them every month with the actual readings, so the bills we paid we thought were accurate. E.On even dared to question whether we called them at all, how patronizing!I told them that people responsible for actually writing down the correct meter readings were obviously useless at their job and that I will be glad never to deal with them again! They even had a cheek to lie to us that the agency didn't provide them with the final readings till November, 3 months after we moved out!This was simply a lie, as I had a copy of the letter and email that agency sent to them, which they did 3 days after we moved out!Shocking. I will never choose them as a provider in the future."
5089|Absolutly terrible customer service, had broken promises time and time again, dont think there sales reps have a clue what is going on half the time, wouldnt touch them with a barge pole!!!!!!!!!!
5090|Shocking ineptitude and liars. We have been without heating and hot water for 2 weeks with no resolution in sight. 4 appointments were made and they only arrive for 2. No call was made to let us know they would be coming and each time a member of the family has had to take time out to wait for hours at the house. No apology and reasons given vary from phone operator - they seem to make excuses up on the spot. We are going to pay an independent engineer to come out tomorrow out of sheer desperation. We will jump contracts as soon as possible. 
5091|I will cancel my Central Heating coverage with Eon and will look for another gas and electricity provider. We had to wait 5 days for a guy to come down and fix it. He had no clue what he was doing and after 30min of reading the manual he said that he needs to order some parts. I had a message this morning that the engineer will come tomorrow and put the part in, happy days but not for long. 5 hours later we found out that it was a misunderstanding and they are still waiting for the parts to turn up. So it's been 7 days without a boiler and we still don't know when they will fix it! This company is a JOKE! 
5092|have been paying monthly for central heating care with e.on for piece of mind and on the understanding that should i have a brakedown it would get sorted in a reasonable time. Well came home to find boiler not working, so i contacted the 0845 number(rip off) and waited 20 mins to then be told no one can get to me for 6 days, bare in mind its up to minus 12 i have a young family and no heating or hot water. e.on should anticipate and ensure that they have sufficient field engineers to cover the winter period, it seems to me they are more interested in profit than the welfare of its custermers. ive cancelled my cover plan and am looking for a new supplier. ive wasted money and time on a company thats incompitent and greedy, as far as im concerned ive been miss sold my cover, it doesnt do what itr says on the tin!!!!
5093|"I am very disappointed with E-ON, woke this morning to a broken boiler 30 minutes to get through to their help line, cannot come out for over a week, waiting this long was not an option for us so had to get a local tradesman out to do the work, work done in the day, heating back on but had to absorb the costs, will not renew, paid my premiums all year only to find they failed me when I needed them, then I had to sort it out my self, Customer Services totally disinterested, their glossy tag line is ""With E-ON central heating care you can sit back and relax"" well its not true "
5094|A lot of people appear to have had problems from previous reviews but then energy companies aren't peoples favourite since continued price hikes. I personally have had no issues with Eon, i have found the pricing very reasonable compared to other companies, they have provided me with a free energy meter which is great and run more energy saving schemes which i could try should i desire. They contact me just before my bill is due so that i can take a meter reading making sure everything is calculated correctly too, this i like as i don't like estimates and can see exactly where my balance is.
5095|Worst company I've ever dealt with.  Signed me up to the incorrect tarrif and then increased my costs from GBP59 per month to GBP153 stating that it was my fault!     They haven't even bothered responding to my letters of complaint and have now written again saying they're hiking it even further.  I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole - KEEP AWAY!!
5096|Shocking company. Don't use them.  They supplied electricity to a house I bought.  They submitted a bill of GBP51 for a period of 1 month during which the property was empty and no electricity was used.  Despite providing numerous meter readings and disputing the bill they refused to listen and tried to take me to court.  In the end I had to pay an incorrect bill as their customer services department were shockingly ineffectual at dealing with anything.  All they did was send out threatening letters. Robbing gits. Don't use them.
5097|I went to Eon in 2008 after a price comparison site said they were cheapest for me.  2 years later and I came out of their fixed deal only to discover that the prices were almost double other offers (I guess the risk you take with fixed deals).  However EON simply sent me a letter giving their new standard tariff.  They didn't contact me to try and offer me a better deal - NOTHING.  Rubbish customer service - they obviously don't want to retain me as a customer so I'm off to Scottish Power.  So far, excellent customer service and the best prices.  DO NOT use EON if you wish to get value for money and be treated as a valued customer.
5098|2 complaints really, one about the Icos Ideal boiler which is uselees but this one's about the hopeless response of EON under my boiler cover plan.  18 months ago it took 5 engineers to sort a fairly basic problem out. All they wanted to do was get out of the house and get to the next job - on the first time the boiler failed again as engineer was driving away! And the response time is a joke. Just rang them because the boiler has failed (again) and the irritating guy on the phone drawls that because it's a priority i.e. no heating or hot water they can come out in 2 days time! Should never have left British Gas and when this fault is repaired I am cancelling and going back to BG.
5099|i bought a rep 1 bed flat in ipswich and as the guy had ran up a GBP1500 bill before had to get it quashed.eon installed a prepayment electrcity meter which i didnt mind and i went with them for for their tarif and keycard.they were an absolute rip off 39p a day standing charge even though it was a new account etc.so i decided to change to edf who were brilliant.after i had suplied reading to eon at the start of my contract and on finishing i had a bill for GBP72 as a final payment ahem i though prepayment ment no bills lol.i phoned them up with another meter reading and got a bill for GBP7.46 which they still cant tell me what the hell the bill is for.an absolute joke and to make matters worse the women on the phone tried to take the p==s by copying what i was saying not funny to say the least customer service useless stear well clear of.im going to take them to the energy ombusman for unecessary stress i have went through people need to do this more often i think
5100|Tried for 30 minetes to get into my acct. hopeless.
5101|The worst service I have ever received. Took out a landlords central heating and boiler cover plan. Never sent contract details, take days to come out for a repair, conflicting opinions about what repair is needed and lo and behold not covered for them under the contract. Poor customer service, length of time on hold to call centre not acceptable. Terrible, should have stayed with British Gas!!! DON'T DO IT!!!!!!
5102|Absolutely shocking. Moved house and waited for over a month before they sent me a refund of the money I had overpaid via direct debit. I only received the cheque after I made several phone calls to them and sent several emails (all of which went unanswered). I also emailed their director of customer services several weeks ago and to date, I have not even received an acknowledgement.  You will save yourself a whole lot of grief if you don't go near them. I don't think they deserve even one star.
5103|"i have electric only no gas, have lived with my partner here or one year in a 2 bed apartment. we both work during the day and are not often home we agreed with eon a monthly payment of GBP70 which was fine. i recieved a letter yesterday telling mr that we are GBP900 in debit since may and demanding a ""slight increase of payment"" to GBP320 a month!!!!! i think its absolutely disgusting that we were given no warning and shall be changing providers DO NOT USE EON!!!!"
5104|STAY AWAY!! EON have been a total DISGRACE. I have received sky-high bills for a property which is not even occupied! And when i have tried to speak to there so called customer services have had no joy being passed from department to department and banging my head of a brick wall. And to hammer the final nail in the coffin they installed a faulty meter which they could not take a final reading from so billed me for GBP130 plus another GBP94 - figures i think they just pulled out of a hat!! NIGHTMARE. Recommend to a friend? Not to my worst enemy. Ive only clicked the stars because i couldn't go any further without doing so but a true reflection of my experiences is 0/5 .
5105|If anyone is thinking of using these people for a direct debit account, forget it. The idea as far as I'm concerned is to pay a steady amount over the whole year. E.On won't let you. They will dictate the amount THEY think is right and no amount of arguing or reasoning will change their mind.  They have tried to put my monthly payment up by GBP40 recently, and despite my sending them the pure mathematics of my energy usage, they continue to reply in the most condescending way saying my offer won't cover the usage.   I've had to cancel the direct debit, so now they've sent in their pitbulls threatening to fit a prepayment meter.  Will be switching in a month or so when the contract is up. These are the nastiest company I've ever had to deal with, and that includes the banks.  Please, please, if you want to use direct debit to make regular, even payments, do NOT use this company. They want payment in advance and will not listen to reason.
5106|Dont touch them with a barge pole.Absolutely useless wont bore you with the details you get the picture,
5107|"Hi again. I wrote a review in April about my highest bills ever for a 2 bed flat. Well by the time i had my meter checked by them, the electrician told me is broken but when i received their notice i was said that the meter it was actually broken but not registering to much actually being to slow!I consider this INSANE.Bearing in mind that my consumption was around 90-100kw/day in march, eon telling me that actually is more than that i think is insane!!MY GOD IS JUST A TWO BEDROOM FLAT NOT A FACTORY!!.I gave them a call and asked them to send me a copy of the official report from the electrician and guess what?they said they can't do it because is an electronic format which can't be reproduced on a paper and i have to believe them because they don't  have any reason to pass me wrong information because they are here to help me!!!CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?? 2 days after i received a letter saying that they will pass me more information when they will have it. Another 5 days passed and I heard the intercom ringing....SURPRISE...without any appointment(or at least they didn't tell me)it was an electrician who came to change my meter saying to me that i can refuse to be changed with one same-a-like but this will mean that i have to contact eon again and ask for another kind of meter that i want and some charges may apply. Tired to deal with this insane situation i decided to say ""ok, change it"", i called them to make an arrangement to split the amount and I'm looking forward to move out from this flat as soon as possible because disputing with them i founded a lost of time, stress and also waste of money again(they want me to call an private authorized electrician to check all my house if i still don't agree with them which i can't afford it) so i decided better to pay them 300pounds more(after some calculus this is the amount of money extra i think they are charging me) than to pay 400-500 for an electrician and i will move out from the flat(which i rent) at the end of the summer. "
5108|No discount on final bill equals a rip off, typical of energy companies Im afraid.
5109|Central heating contract with e-on. Don't bother. Our boiler broke down on Sunday 28th March. We are still waiting for it to be repaired nearly 2weeks later. What a catalogue of disasters. Initially they couldn't get out until the Thursday to have a look. Lo and behold they told us it was broke. They had to order parts. The engineer said he wasn't sure what was wrong so he ordered 3 circuit boards. Easter weekend got in the way but he said the parts would be in his lock-up Tuesday morning. Deborah at the complaints department said she would book the appointment for Tuesday morning. 9 o'clock came and went 10 o'clock came and went. No sign of e-on. I phoned again. Half an hour later they answered the phone. An appointment hadn't even been booked. After much complaining the said they would come on the Wednesday. They fitted the parts but still no hot water. More parts had to be ordered. We have found out today Saturday that those parts hadn't been ordered until Friday. Nobody seems to know where the parts are and they will give us a telephone call on Monday 12the April with an update. By then we will have been without hot water for 15 days. Hows that for a service contract. 
5110|EON are useless! I had a bill sent to me for over GBP800 at one point, and I live in a small one bedroom flat. I argued with them for months and ended up cancelling my direct debit with them. I was paying GBP27.00 a month and that was keeping me about right, as I was never at home and working in two jobs, so only ever used to come home to sleep! There was no way I owed them hundreds of pounds. After alot of arguing the credited my account with GBP490.49 but that still left me with a GBP300 bill and a small baby to care for. Their debt collectors turned up unannounced on my doorstep and asked for GBP90 per month to cover my usage, this I did not agree with. Then they asked for GBP35 every two weeks. Still that was alot of money. All the time I had been paying what I could, when I could. Now they are threatening all sorts and I have already paid GBP35 this month and were not even halfway through it! If I could pay them off and change supplier I would, but I can't afford it. They have estimated I am going to use GBP900 over the next 12 months and want me to their estimates - I don't think so! Very Unhappy
5111|Hi. I will tell you my story. I moved in a 2 bed flat in November 2009.I have a eon meter(3).My first bill was dated on 20 of February 2010 and it was 440 pounds. My flat is 90% on electricity(I have just the hot water on gas). I don't use a dryer and during the day nobody is at home, no heaters are on,just the fridge but it still shows on my bill that most of my kWh are spent during they day but at the end 440 pounds sounded fine for me. Today(31 of march 2010) I received an email from eon saying that my bill is ready to view online even than I'm paying quarterly and BIG SURPRISE: from 20 of February 2010 till 31 of march 2010 i have to pay 426 pounds.THIS IS RIDICULOUS!I have the same appliances and more than that I considerably reduced my heaters consummation by the fact that outside is warmer then it was in the winter time and i don't feel that i have to turn them on so often! I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK!so i went quickly to check my meter which SURPRISE AGAIN was showing that the readings they done were right!NOW I'M WANDERING IF THE METER HAS A PROBLEM OR IF SOMEBODY IS CONNECTED ILLEGALLY TO MY METER! tomorrow i will give them a call to sort-out but reading your reviews it seems that this is something usual for them and also that they will not do something very quick to check the meter. I'm very confused and stressed and writing here at this hour in the night is just the result of that bill BECAUSE I CAN'T SLEEP. Please let me know if somebody ever had the same problem as mine and if is any possibility to have a broken meter because I'm desperate and I'm sure i will not have a chance to sleep until this will be sorted out.
5112|I have just informed E-On that my company will not be renewing our contract for a further year as we have found a better price with British Gas. The attitude of their staff was downright offensive and all I wanted was a reference number or confirmation e-mail of my call.  Never ever would I return to them or recommend anyone else to use them. I am also changing them as my home electricity supplier.  Please think carefully about using them. The majority of these reviews says it all!  
5113|We pay EON by monthly Standing Order (I wouldn't trust them to administer a variable Direct Debit correctly) and have confirmed with their Customer Services dept, on numerous occasions, that they are happy for us to do this. However, they still send Overdue notices demanding that we pay in full immediately and when I phone them to say that we have agreed to pay by installments they say there is no record of such an agreement.  We have been with them for four and a half years. Last year we paid over GBP1200 for electricity in a small two-bedroom flat but we are unfortunately stuck with these jokers. We have approached other companies but have been told by them that our meter is the 'wrong type' (?) and we would have to pay for a new one to be installed, which we simply can not afford to do. So much for consumer choice. 
5114|About this time last year I received a bill restating my electricity usage from October 2002. I asked the reason for this and was told that this was because ome time in the pastthey had automatically swapped the two meters now had just discovered this. Needless to say this meant that I owed them hundreds of pounds. I then noticd that my meters had been certified in and installed in 1986 and hence were well outside their certified life. When I challenged EON, I was initially told that the meters had in fact been replaced in 1997 by digital meters. As the meters are electro mechanical (induction) I challenged this and Eon changed to say that the meteres were changed in 1997 for electomechanical meters. After several further letters I have made a complaint to the nergy Ombudsman and am awaiting the results. Re Meter Certifiction: There will be a label on your meter showing the date when this has been done and if this is more than ten years ago you should question this and the accuray of your readings. 
5115|I have been with EOn for 2 years and I manage my Electricity and Gas online.   I appreciate that you can track your energy consumption on their website and compare it to last year consumption.   You can also switch between different tariff with just a click of a button. I am currently on Fixonline 4 that gives me some visibility on my bills until Feb 2011. I am very pleased with the hefty discount I receive from managing everything online.  They also track fairly our consumption by adjusting the direct debit we pay each month.    
5116|Please stay away from Eon. They didn't send us a bill for 6 months, despite me registering our details when we moved into our new house. They say they never received our details and had sent us 3 bills in the 6 months (despite not having our address so who knows where they went!!!)  I wrote a written complaint about all of this and before they even bothered to respond they sent a letter saying unless we paid our GBP420 bill immediately they'd be sending the debt collectors round!!!! This letter also didnt have the right address on and only got to us because the post man recognised our name on the envelope!!  You phone them to resolve these issues and you just get met with rude people who want to do nothing to help you. Their customer service is absolutely shocking! (they only got one star on my rating above because you have to put something. Given the choice I wouldn't have given them any stars)
5117|GBP800.00 Electricity bill for a married couple in a 1 bedroom apartment?  My wife and I moved into our new 1 bedroom apartment in February 2009 and gave the initial meter reading to e-on. Between February and September we had 2 bills from e-on. One for GBP100, and one for GBP50. In this time, their meter reader came and read the wrong meter which has lead to our bills being estimated.   When I finally gave them a proper meter reading they sent me a ridiculous bill for GBP624.  I cannot understand how my wife and I, can use so much electricity in this tiny apartment. It is absurd. The problem is this set of apartments are tied to e-on so we cannot even go to another provider if we wanted to.  The only thing we can do, is to move house which is what we have decided to do. We cannot carry on using almost GBP70 electricty every month.
5118|Probably the worst Customer service I have ever come across, quite shocking in fact for a company these days.  Ignored my email giving the date of my move.  Then told me I had left them before I had, apparantly I had gone to another company for 4 days although they were still happy to take my direct debits and not tell me anything and then to top it all get my final meter reading wrong twice.  In the process of looking for a better company, I would rather pay more and get good customer service.  Prices reasonable but very poor customer service.
5119|Been with E-on for 3 years had no problems at all..Found there online site easy to use and informative especially the charts showing my gas/electric usage over the past 24mths ..my bills have been lower every year but mainly due to me being more aware of my usage via the charts..every year ive recieved a refund if ive over payed and my monthly direct debit has always been altered to suite my usage..overall i am a happy customer and havent had any problems so far but i cant speak for everyone..so not looking to change supplier any time soon.So keep up the good work e-on
5120|Eon, value for money not at all,  Service is very bad, engineers dont come out on time, they can never seem to fix anything according to them and there prices are poor. Definetely would NOT reccomend Eon to any people I know,  Go with BRITISH GAS !!
5121|shocking - attitude on the telephone was similar to calling vicky pollard from little britain.  mis quoted cost of fuel GBP56 pcm (apr 09) subsequently nov 09 increased bill to 123 pcm they dont send statements, you are expected to download your own (obviously its easier to increase direct debits this way) GBP123 pcm to heat a one bedroom flat is an interesting concept. Going back to British gas. Amusing way a) to speak with clients b) to run a business - what annoys me is that businesses like this are likely to deal with older people's bills and maybe vulnerable people's bills.
5122|I have been with this bunch of donkeys for around 3 years and am now finally trying to leave them to go to another supplier. Their meter readers come round every quarter and invariably get the meter reading wrong landing me with bills anything upto GBP3000 for electric alone. Anyway, now they know I am leaving they landed me a GBP970 bill for electric and instead of sending me a red bill, they sent a debt collector round. I am sick to death with ringing them up each and every quarter because of their incompetence and am now going to take it up with Ofgem.
5123|Please consider going to any other company but these ones. Their customer service should be given a consistency award - for being consistently useless.  Their meter reader read the meter number as the starting point for when the gas would be changed from. Receiving a bill for GBP615 for the month can give you quiet the shock. It took me four phone calls to get them to raise an account with the correct reading - for GBP104.  When I moved out, I rang and told them the updated readings and my new address. I didn't receive a final account, despite ringing (again) to request one. I've only just received an account because they put it in the hands of a collection agency who rang me straight away - on a number they would have got from Eon.  Totally hopeless.
5124|I changed my gas supplier from EON to EDF , it took EON 3 months to send my final bill which got lost in the post then I got a threatening letter, I got the bill online which came to GBP335 although I had been paying by monthly directy debit.I checked the final meter reading from EON taken in April, this was higher than the meter is showing today 8 Aug.  The error in the final bill is in excess of GBP300!!!Best action is to send EON the meter reading on line frequently near the change over.
5125|"Have just moved from E.On after several years on their various EnergyOnline tarrifs. Eventually got fed up with having to keep an eye on the latest ""version"" of the tariff and phoning up to be changed. Final insult is that they don't apply any of the discount (18% in my case) to the final bill. As this is the ""bigger bills"" time of year this is around  GBP100 , thus ensuring that I will NEVER use them again, however good their deals look initially. Shame because the prices were good most of the time."
5126|Received a huge bill from EON Gas & Electricity. Questioned it as have a small house and out at work all day. Told it was correct and asked to pay it. Advised I couldn't afford all they were asking - it was over fifteen hundred pounds ! Told to go onto a payment plan of 120 pounds a month and that I would have to have a pre payment meter fitted. Advised this was still too much and still didn't understand how I could possibly owe that much. Then the customer service lady became really rude and told me I shouldn't use the Gas if I couldn't afford to pay it and should put some money by in a tin each week!! Turned out after months of me complaining that they had been sending me someone elses meter reading and that they now owed me a big refund !
5127|I left EON because they almost doubled my direct debit and refused to set it at a sensible level. When I left they didn't give me my online discount on the final bill (which was almost  GBP40). 
5128|"I signed up to Eon, attracted by the prospect of having my energy prices capped until mid 2009. Everything went fine until I got a letter telling me my monthly direct debit was an, in my opinion, under-estimated  GBP17 a month. I phoned them 3 times and eventually had to speak to someone in ""complaints"" who has promised to set it to a more sensible  GBP60. They told me I had a choice between paying either GBP17 or  GBP80 (way too little/much). I felt this was an odd policy and felt they were inflexible when I'm just trying to be a responsible consumer. "
5129|I have submitted several enquiries to E.ON Gas & Electricity via email and not had one reply. Not even an acknowledgment of receipt. I have also tried to phone them but they simply don't answer. I have waited for an advisor to answer my call for 20 minutes on several occasions. To me Eon are a typical example of those companies who pull you in with apparently cheap pricing and then you find out why. 
5130|When I tried to complain to E.ON Gas & Electricity about billings, repeated use of (under)estimates despite the actual readings being read by their meter reading person, sent in by post, sent via their website and telephoned in, I struggled to get a 'why' for 8 months. Gave loads of different reasons. All round poor experience for me, never again!
5131|5 weeks without hot water and heating. Took the 2 weeks to offer electric temp. heaters. It is my opinion that engineers need customer facing skills as well as better diagnostic skills. I do not recommend E.ON Fix by trial and error. Not competent. Very slow. 
5132|We have had a very bad experience with E.ON / EON as we knew we were paying too little monthly, but they would not up our monthly DD so we have ended up with a demand for GBP450.00 despite contacting them previously to deal with this.  After several calls being put on hold for approx 10-15mins at a time they eventually agreed to up our monthly payment to include our outstanding amount. Poor customer service.
5133|I called for a quote and I was lied to after I said I would check other comparison sites. They said that Uswitch website was the same as every other comparison site and I wouldn't get a better deal so I went ahead with Uswitch. BUT cancelled when I called another comparison site and got a better deal. 
5134|USwitch is only interested in their commission. My experience was a disaster. I ended up being billed twice by BOTH energy companies. USwitch never handled the switch correctly as promised. They were useless. No start date, no last meter reading, in fact no switch until I chased it up 11 times. 
5135|having used the site to find the best comparative deal i chose one which boated it would save me over GBP300 per year.  i duly entered my information and was sent confirmation of the switch and followed the advice to cancel my direct debit with my current supplier as everything was in hand.to date U Switch has not contacted me nor has my new supplier been made aware that I am supposed to be a customer.  i e mailed customer services at U Switch and , nothing.   one energy supplier has been in contact.  My energy supplier who has not been informed that I had switched away from and so am still in contract with and have now run up a debt with them.  I have never been in debt with any energy supplier and so thanks to U switch another first.best advice is call any supplier and do the work yourself.  U Switch is about getting advertising revenue not getting a better deal for the consumer.
5136| they made the process very simple and explained everything to me in terms I understood
5137|Telephoned call centre this morning, very helpful person explained everything in detail,  very pleased and saved GBP3.70 many thanks
5138|Uswitch recommended I switch over to Isupply energy, over a year ago worst move ever. To top it all they owe me over GBP133; admit they owe me it, this was pre-Christmas despite many calls still waiting.  Never use either again.
5139|Cancelled a switch request on line but still received an e mail saying my details had been passed to a new supplier, phoned u choose and was told yes the details had been sent and that I couldn't have cancelled on line and they were unable to cancel by phone, only way to cancel was to phone the supplier, I did this and was kept waiting on hold for 25 mins only to be told when I finally got through that the switch had already been cancelled. Worst customer relation dept I have ever encountered.
5140|Used U-Switch to change from EDF to Scottish Eletric. Their comparisons indicated SE were much better value (we shall see...), so I used them for the switch-over.Unfortunately SE it appears are utterly incompetent, incapable of taking 3 simple readings correctly. Their CS is abysmal, even going as far as to hang up on me after making me wait an well over an hour for their callback!!As such I would urge caution when using U-Switch: Though the deal's might look better (and I am growing increasingly wary that SE's estimated savings may well be a good deal off in the long run) check out the rep of the company making that offer first.Next time I look to change, which will be sooner rather than later as I have no great desire to stay with Scottish Electric for very long after being hung up on, I will be a good deal more cautious.
5141|On your recommendation I recently switched to First Utility for energy supply. Unfortunately , I gave them an incorrect reading for my Gas Meter. I immediately realised what I had done and tried to rectify it. This has proved to be one of the worst experiences of my life and I promise that in future I shall not have any dealings with either U switch or First utility. Before you recommend any company you should acquaint yourselves with its capabilities and think of the damage it can inflict on you.First utility has no infrastructure at all
5142|they found me a gas & electric plan took it out with them.then my new utility company first utility send me a email telling me they can not supply me my gas & electric due to me having the wrong meter's.as i have the standard meter's that all utility companies fit in you property.i phoned uswitch they could not believe that what they have said an going to look into that.as for broadband & phone they gave me one price for it an guaranteed it.took it out with them.them got email of that supplier giving me a different price which is higher than that the one uswitch guaranteed price one an they are looking into that as-well.to get one thing wrong but two get two things in within 48 hours wrong not very good.i would say be very careful when taking things out with there price comparison site's.
5143|"i telephoned uswitch at 12.09 today. seems the recipent couldn't hear me, and terminated the call with ""go and get yourself a new life""having been an employer over the years, this being would have been instant dismissal historically.tried sending email complaint to sales director and m.d. to receive automated response telling me a reply would take 7 days - because they were busy -suffice to say, go compare were courteous  and secured my business would i consider uswitch again, well, work that out for oneself."
5144|I took up a deal to switch energy suppliers with a free wine voucher included in the offer some 6 months ago. U switch have failed to honour this or respond to emails and phone calls. Although not an over riding factor in the switch I feel customers are being mislead. I will not be using their service in the future.
5145|The website was straightforward to use to request a switch from ScottishPower (too expensive and have you tried ringing their call centre recently?). However, after the initial email in December congratulating me on my switch, I heard nothing from the new supplier or Uswitch. After 3 weeks, I emailed Uswitch asking them to confirm the switch was going forward. After a further 3 weeks, I had a reply from Uswitch confirming they had passed the information on. This isn't the sort of response time you'd want to receive. Over the six weeks, I have received about 20 advertising emails from Uswitch. It's pretty clear where their priorities lie. I will try other companies like Money Supermarket in future.
5146|I have been duped. Reassured that I'd be switching both gas & electricity providers and promised frozen rates for 15 months, I had an outstanding payment (<GBP100) which was instantly made to the electricity company and 15 days later Uswitch simply informed me that the switch was being blocked. No reasons given, no personalised message or advice offered. There appears to be no means of reply to emails either. My electricity company continues to overcharge me and only offers an address to write to apart from the Mon-Fri CS lines - inconvenient, inefficient and expensive. Am I bound till eternity with my old provider? Do Uswitch actually care? Uswitch need to warn everyone, in no uncertain terms, of the right of providers to deny the switch, even when accounts have been settled.
5147|Tried to switch my duel fuel provider and spoke to a very abrupt ,unhelpful and unpleasant operator.
5148|I used uSwitch to review my gas and electricity charges to select a better deal.  Switched Gas with one supplier and Electricity with a second supplier to a fixed price dual fuel deal with the existing electricity supplier.Website was straightforward, promised huge savings, and enabled an easy selection and switch.Problem 1 - confirmatory email failed to provide any details of the calculations displayed by the websiteProblem 2 - no reply to request for clarification - just an email saying huge volumes of queries and so there would be a delay.  No answer ever receivedProblem 3 - confirmatory email provides only a vague summary of the changes I selected.  So vague that it is impossible to tell if the change was indeed to Dual fuel fixed priceProblem 4 - only my gas seems to have been switched - but the email from uswitch is too vague to support my claim that both should have been switchedProblem 5 - clarification requested from uswitch as to exactly what I selected  - no reply just an email saying huge volumes of queries and so there would be a delay.  
5149|After getting a horrible shock from my energy supplier (Southern Electric) I decided that I had to switch. The obvious choice was BBC favourite U-Switch, so after trying their confusing website I thought I'd give them a call. How disappointed I was. Their call staff seemed to be on commission as it felt like they were trying push me to a certain tariff and supplier really quickly so they could get straight onto the next customer, instead of listening to me and my poor experiences with the particular supplier they wanted me to switch to before. In the end I went to a well rated competitor website who don't have an aggressive call centre and I'm now happily switched - didn't stop uswitch pestering again to try to get me to switch broadband!
5150|My energy supplier, npower, mentioned in a call about something else that they were about to increase my energy bill on their standard rate 30%! Even though I was expecting a rise in line with the announced 8-10% this winter, I had definitely not been informed of this increase. 30 PER CENT INCREASE, you read that right. I had a look on a couple of comparison sites and called uSwitch to see if somebody could explain what npower thought they were doing with my bill. The advisor (helpful, sympathetic, knowledgeable) made it clear that I was already paying over the odds on my existing bill and that I should refuse the 30% rise and either change supplier or ask to be put on a lower price plan, even if that meant launching an investigation. Worst of all, rather than needing to change supplier, it was actually my existing energy supplier was offering the next best tariff I could have gone to on the market. I am still not sure whether the energy companies are, or are going to be, forced to put you on the best tariff, but npower seem to think that they are under no obligation to do so. npower were ultimately quite obliging about changing me to the new tariff, and I was advised to 'keep checking online since we change our tariffs quite frequently'. They had nothing to say about the money that I have already been overcharged and were not forthcoming about a complaints procedure. I am still deciding whether or not launch a complaint against them. It strikes me that I am not alone in being less informed about my energy prices than I should be. But no one should be subjected to this kind of predatory behaviour by the energy companies. I would like to say thank you to uSwitch and to her in particular for providing such an outstanding service and giving me the confidence and the information to tackle npower head on. I am incredibly grateful, and will be recommending you.
5151|Well done to Customer Care Consultant Conor Coleman from U-Switch so helpful in transferring my Electricity (from NPower) and Gas (from British Gas) to Eon with a saving of GBP455 per year  Its the only way to deal with British Gas and other energy companies who overcharge to the max,  so if you want to save money on your energy bills just pick up the phone and speak to a Customer Care Consultant  at U-Switch its easy they do all the form filling talk you through it give you advise and explain what all the questions mean Simples
5152|I would like to say a big Thank You to Wayne, who worked extremely hard for me this morning. What a delight to have a happy, helpful person on the end of the telephone.  I hope that I get to speak to him again, should I need help with any switches in the near future.  Thank You Wayne.
5153|I recently contacted USwitch to facilitate my electricity changeover and Naomi the company representative was excellent throughout. Clear & concise during the whole process. Many thanks for all your help. Andrew Green
5154|I discussed my choices with a person called Rui who gave excellent advice.What a first class service!!!! 
5155|Very good service from our representativePainless and quick no more than ten minutes To hopefully save GBP300 per year
5156|Bravo to U-Switch !!On a day that saw me transferring Electricity (from SWALEC) and Gas (from British Gas) we did a combined bill with NPower, that will see savings of GBP179.   This gives me paper bills at no cost, a single point of contact if I need further advice, a fixed rate until 30th April 2015 and no cancellation fees.I have been with SWALEC and British Gas for some 25 years and guess what...they are now nothing short of being 'criminal' in their pricing operations...the evidence they gave in Westminster on 29th October showed them to be unethical in their operations and as such NPower came out on top.....   
5157|Rang uSwitch to get electricity & gas price comparisons only to find they do not recognise my post code. Admittedly, my address is a new build but as it is almost 12 months old I had anticipated a company such as this would have up-to-date technology! A bit concerning when they're trying to find you the best deal. The call centre operative offered very little in the way of help/advice so I had to speak to Customer Services - they wanted to use a generic post code based on the area where I lived and I would have to contact any companies directly to switch. Sort of defeats the whole purpose of their organisation... Sadly I won't be recommending - you need to work on your customer service guys!
5158|I did my homework and was going to switch online to another energy supplier. I just wanted more information about uSwitch, as its so easy to use a service and find you have made a big mistake. I called and spoke to an advisor. She was very pleasant and clearly wanted to help by providing the facts without trying to persuade me to go with a specific Energy supplier. It reminded me what great customer service can be like, when we are so used to doing everything online with no personal interaction. Definitely a big plus. If you are thinking of switching Energy suppliers and want to use uSwitch I certainly would recommend uSwitch. If you do your homework before hand it will make the process a lot easier. Steve
5159|Very clear in his instructing and easy to understand.Explained everything to me. Very helpful & friendly Would definitely recommend to family & friends.
5160|The advisor was excellent. Informed me of all costs and terms, really easy to switch and she did all the paperwork etc. thanks
5161|I done a comparrison as i am on key meters, at the time i was on Npower but had been looking at Ebico which on my estimates looked much cheaper as they have zero standing charges compared to roughly GBP90 per yr with other companies. I done the comparrison and it gave me British Gas. I took a risk and changed to Ebico and its absolutely great. What i use on Npower on a week lasts me just over 2 weeks with Ebico. USwitch had Ebico as more expensive than Npower?? Anyway i am now on a ficed deal with Ebico, paying less than i was last year and 2 days after changing NPower and British gas hiked their prices. Had i changed to British Gas or N Power i would have been paying far more. Do your own research
5162|"I tried this many times to compare electricity suppliers, when I put in my current details I kept getting the same fault ""we cannot find that tariff and payment method""  clearly there is a bug in the system as the details are correct.  Found another comparison site which worked fine with the exact details I put in this system.  I will switch with them instead...  Disappointing!"
5163|I gave uswitch all the details of my economy 7 consumption and they worked out Scottish Power would be the cheapest supplier.  Weeks down the line, Scottish Power told me they do not have a tariff for economy 7 meters and cannot supply.  How on earth did uswitch work out that they were the cheapest
5164|I found the website very easy to use. It identified a choice of suppliers offering cheaper deals. However, I wanted reassure of small print for the new supplier. I was able to get it quickly and painlessly over the phone. I have now arranged to switch supplier. I would recommend the website or the phone service to anyone.
5165|Having looked at a number of companion sites I was surprised to find that uSwitch had offers which were not published by the competition.  It was one of those offers that we took forward.  In reaching our decision we were helped by Conor Coleman who proved to be excellent at his job.  He was both understanding and yet highly professional.  His intelligent analysis of our requirements and understanding of the options available gave us the confidence to proceed with the result that we are now delighted with the resultant switch to our new provider.  We strongly recommend uSwitch unreservedly and without any hesitation.
5166|Just got off the the phone from uswitch, and what brilliant service I have just been given.Very friendly, understanding, down to earth.Any way this guys name is TYRONE.A real credit to your company.
5167|As a group of students with no real experience of how to deal with energy companies or switching or comparisons we were very fortunate to have rung U switch. Not only did they help us switch, but they talked us through different tariffs and what would be useful for us. It would have been nice if they could also have sorted out our water supplier. Thank you tyrone! 
5168|To someone not very computer literate the system was easy to follow,In conversation with the member  of staff it was easy to relax and the information I received was very informative and helpful,I have already recommended you to some friends.This was the best site I have ever used.
5169| Thanks to a member of your customer care team for assistance in helping to transfer an energy account which was not straight forward. Uswitch has always been my preferred comparison site for energy usually managed by the web but this time by phone. 
5170|I was a bit uncertain about going through the process of switching power suppliers for a better deal but Uswitch made it so easy. The gentleman was very knowledgeable and helpful.I learned alot which enabled me to make a quick informed decision that should save me a fair amount of money.I would recommend this service to all my friends .  
5171|Just phoned uSwitch after using their website to compare my current provider's prices with other providers to see if I could save money. The uSwitch advisor on the phone, a chap, was extremely helpful, courteous, very knowledgeable, clear in his communication, and most importantly recommended an alternative provider and cheaper online dual fuel monthly direct debit plan that would save me a lot of money when compared to my current gas and electricity provider.Very happy with the service he provided as a representative for uSwitch. I'd rate my experience with uSwitch as 10/10 on this occasion. 
5172|The morning I spoke to Wayne Campbell and he helped me switch energy suppliers! I'm new to all the switching around and have no clue what the best rates are, however Wayne was lovely and I'm more than happy to trust his judgment with regards to my switch and I'm come away feeling very happy and a little less stressed!    Wayne was great to talk to and didn't make me feel pressured at all! He ave me the info I needed which helped me make a good decision! Me and Wayne do share the same birthday and I have been promised a birthday card, that would be great customer care! So we shall see. Thanks guys! 
5173|I had a lovely chat with a very patient gentleman who ran me though some simple questions to get me the best deal, in the most fun way. There was no pushing and no persuading. Thanks for your help and I hope you enjoy your next Jack Danial & coke. Cheers
5174|"Just finished speaking with ""T*r**e"" on uswitch.com. Nice guy and very helpful and understanding too. Provided all the information I needed to make the right choice of utility provider for both my mum and me. Great service...recommend it to anyone ! "
5175|I found the service very helpful, the advisor was polite courteous and above all very competent, He got me a reduction of about GBP50 on my dual fuel contract, on what I was paying last year, No mean achievement considering the rising costs of gas/electric. Also he made sense of the myriad of the different deals advertised that I found incomprehensible. And together we got the plan that best suited me.  Many thanks U SwitchGreat  
5176|A very helpful and cheerful service, I was given clear and precise details on what I had asked for. No sales spiel just the facts and what was the best plan and cheapest tariffs available to me all in all a tip top service and would use Uswitch again for other services 
5177|Your staff member,Mr Wayne Campbell was extremely helpful and was very knowledgeable on the subject.With his advice,we will be changing our energy suppliers at the correct time and to the most best deal. Thank you. 
5178|I would not use uSwitch ever again. Went online last December to change my Gas ad Electricity supplier was advised by uSwitch I would save GBP145.95. It was nothing but hassle with Npower and after 9 months have only just got a bill to find out I owe over GBP300 more than I was paying with my other supplier. Don't trust the figures online. 
5179|Very helpful and easy conversation to switch energy suppliers. With everything explained through the process. Nice clear conversation with what I assume is a UK based call centre. Well done Tyrone
5180|This is the 2nd time i have used u switch. I have dealt with the same person on both occasions.I found his manner excellent and clear,he provided me with impartial advice and I would recommend this service to everyone.  
5181|I had several calls with an advisorwhen trying to decide if to stay with Sky or move to Virgin as part of my relocation. I have always been with Sky so i had a lot of questions to ask to make sure of what i was getting. He was always very prfessioanl, patient and understanding and helped to provide all the information i required. Thank you for the services. Regards, Mr Khan
5182|I received a helpful and friendly service with good advice.
5183|helpful, efficient, quick, polite, knowledgeable, 
5184|"Used this joke of a company to change energy suppliers. Gave all my details, they provided me with the best quote, I chose one, put all my details in, and got TWO confirmation emails back advising I will be contacted in 7-14 days.  SIX weeks have passed and I have heard nothing, so rang the supplier I am going to who advised they have never received anything from USwitch.  So after all that waiting, they didn't even bother sorting out the application.  At least they won't get their commission, and as stupid as they are, they even sent me through the GBP44.99 Naked Wines voucher as a thanks for ""switching"". It's been used, so they won't be getting it back. If you want the best deal, do the leg work yourself (that's what I am doing in future) or use another comparison site, but stay clear of these jokers."
5185|I have never been so pleased about a service in all my life the staff member was excellent and he explained everything in detail to myself without being boring. He had a great sense of humour which I think is a valuable talent in this day and age as you feel valued as a person and not a number.   I will be telling everyone about U Switch keep up the good work.
5186|Very grateful for the advice and very clear and concise explanations received. Answered all my queries quickly and efficiently with good sense of humour rarely experienced in these situations!  Everything I needed to know to complete my energy switch was politely and comprehensively explained. Would definitely recommend and certainly use again.
5187|"Honestly, it was a real pleasure to talk to your ""skilled"" and ""knowledgeable""  representative about the switch over to ""Price Protector  March 2017 plan"". To have such a person in your outfit is a credit. Hope the rest  is as good as he is! "
5188|As usual the consultant Idealt with was clear and concise, all the information I needed was provided. Great service again!!!!!
5189|I have used u switch once before and I was very happy so I have returned and got excellent advice from the person I spoke to. I know exactly how much i'm going to say and what's going to happen in the next few weeks. It makes switching easy.
5190|Just switch to energy supplier after having a professional and honest advise from Uswitch over the free phone. Good UK based call centers and quick, expert advise. No time waste and straight to the point. Thanks to Joe who done job in less than 15 min and estimated saved over a GBP180 a year. 
5191|I spoke to an advisor who was very helpful. It was a relief to speak to somebody impartial who could advise me and he was very clear. I would recommend this service as it is difficult to get an idea of comparisons or features of tariffs by speaking to individual companies.
5192|I've never thought about switching my utilities previously just because it seemed like too much hassle. USwitch is a fantastic service; its not often you get such good free and impartial advice. The fact that USwitch has all the information youd need AND takes care of the actual transfer takes all of the stress and complication out of switching providers. The website is clear and concise, the whole experience from an initial exploratory look into how much I could save to the eventual switching of provider could not have been easier. It has definitely encouraged me to keep an eye out regularly for any savings that could be made.
5193|In amongst all of the stresses of moving house, the helpful efficient and friendly service that Uswitch offered in finding the best gas and electricity deals was an absolute godsend. I will definitely be using the service again and recommending to other people. A real pleasure to speak to friendly and helpful staff and not have to stay on hold at all!
5194|i spoke to a gentlemen on friday and i was looking to find a cheaper deal for my mums gas and elec and iam not a computer person so i was pleased he called he explained everything from start to finish in a professional and understanding way . I will defo use the service again and without a doubt
5195|Having lost 20 minutes of my life on a uncustomer-friendly conversation with Energy Helpline, I happened upon the sheer delight of USwitch.They talked me through switching my energy provider.  It was clear he knew what he was talking about, had all the info, took time to find out what I wanted. Simple, painless and more particularly - exactly what I wanted.  He suggested I looked at deals for my broadband and arranged for a colleague to call me at an appointed time.So, here we are at the appointed time and a man called me about my communications package.  Boy could I save some dosh.  Yet again, it was clear that he knew what he was talking about, had all the info at his finger tips, found out what I wanted and made some suggestions.  The only disappointing thing is that my service provider came really close to the price so I didn't need to use USwitches service.  And I am honestly disappointed - frankly USwitch deserve something for the service they offer and this review is all that I can do.  But next time......
5196|The information from [name removed] was concise, clear and informative and my questions were answered clearly to allow me to make a decision on the Supplier best suited to my requirements.I would certainly recommend uSwitch to my friends and others looking to switch services.   
5197|I looked on uswitch web site to change my elecricity and gas provider. The Customer Services was [name removed] who was very cheerful and extremely helpful.  I had to terminate our conversation as I had a meeting yesterday and today she called back and helped me change the utilities provider where I was going to make a big savings.  She was extremely helpful and explained the rates and was very knowledgeable.  Recommended the best provider asked clear questions and gave clear answers as well.  I saved GBP130 in minutes with the help of the Advisor.  I would recommend uSwitch to anyone and everyone. I needed to know the consumption of gas and electricity for the year to help me to get the best provider.  The advisor told how to find the information so she could get me the best deal. 
5198|I spoke to a really helpful person [name removed] who was able to answer all my questions clearly and helped me to choose a better tariff than the one I called up about.  There are so many different rates, standing charges, cancellation fees and I felt that [name removed] really took the time to listen to me and what I wanted from my supplier and managed to save me over GBP120 per year, which is fantastic.I would strongly recommend everyone to use this services.No negative point to feed back on this service at all 
5199|Had previously viewed the website which was easy to follow but I like to deal with real people.  Joe the advisor who answered my call was very helpful and knowledgeable.  There is so much to consider with rates, standing charges, cancellation fees and I thank Joe for being patient with me and finding me a competative deal.  
5200|Answered the phone within 2 rings, very helpful, cannot fault.
5201|Joe seemed very experienced staff member. Through & efficient & very helpful.He has helped me before with my enquires. Keep it up Joe.
5202|Joe was quick, efficient and very helpful.  Gave pertinent, valuable, impartial advice.  Would certainly use the service again and recommend it to friends.
5203|Talking with Joe made me feel confident that i was making the right choice. In the past i have changed energy suppliers but it always turned into some kind of drama and it wasnt easy at all. Joe was very pleasant and totally put me at ease and made the change over so simple. 
5204|Very helpfull and imformative customer service representative. He made the process simple and very clear. He explained everything with great clarity and knowledge of the available products. I would definitely recommend this service to anyone looking to save money on their utilty bills.
5205|Excellent service. Sohail was very professional and explained how the switch would work. I would advise anyone to switch using this service. I saved GBP140 in a 15 minute call! Easy. 
5206| I called a month ago   seeking advice for when my current deal ends on April 2nd. I was told of my best options and that I would be contacted nearer the time. This promise was kept and I made my choice. I was very impressed with the knowledge, enthusiasm and friendliness of my contact.  
5207|I was assisted by a very helpful young man named [name removed] ,he made the whole process as easy as possible,which being in my 70s I really appreciated.So a big thankyou [name removed] and keep up the good work. there was`nt anything that I can think of to improve the service.
5208|joe was very helpful and gave you an honest opinion on how to change to a new energy supplier and get new meters as I want to change my prepayment meter to direct debits
5209|I tried to get a comparison of energy suppliers on line, but the site didnt offer any tarrifs for my supplier so i called the free phone number for advice.  The lady sho i spoke to, Lillyann Tuisamoa was fantastic.  She talked me through my options and gave me the assistance in needed.  She then went ahead and changed my supplier saving me GBP200 per year.  She was very helpful, friendly and chatted to me about normal everyday things and showed compasion to my situation (i had to change supply from a pre pay meter for my dad because he is now ill and cant get to the post office to top up his payment card).  Excellent service all round...
5210|Thankyou to Sohail for a seamless transaction and lots of money saved, great guy to deal with and a pleasure to do business with. keep up the good work my friend!
5211|Conor Coleman who is Uswitch advisor is the best when u phone Uswitch ask for Conor he will sort u out.
5212|Joe went out of his way to provide me with useful information and switched me on to the best tariff  and provider for me. I will now be saving GBP55 a year!!!! HAPPY DAYS
5213|Had a call from [name removed. He answered all mt questions without delay. He was very helpful. Top Marks.
5214|Uswitch this evening has made my night.   I am so very pleased with the service, help, advice and general assistance.  Lilyanne was just so friendly and helpful, very clear and made the whole process a real pleasure.  Very pleased with my saving and that I was able to get a good length fixed term.  All instructions were really clear and the process completely painless Would highly recommend this service and especially Lilyanne.  Thank you very much and I look forward to a continued stress-free changeover
5215| I called a month ago   seeking advice for when my current deal ends on April 2nd. I was told of my best options and that I would be contacted nearer the time. This promise was kept and I made my choice. I was very impressed with the knowledge, enthusiasm and friendliness of my contact.  
5216|I had been dis-satisfied with my current energy provider for some time. Eventually, I decided to look at USwitch and see what could be done.  I couldn't have asked for a more informed service.  The rep on the other end of the phone was very efficient and supplied all the information I needed for a painless smooth switch over.  I would recommend USwitch to anyone and would urge people not to put it off, but just log on and get on with it.
5217|The service was excellant went into everything you want to know I would recommend service to friends and family
5218|Excellent service from Joe in the Uswtich customer care team. 
5219|I was very happy with the service I received from uSwitch. He was very informative and spent time explaining everything to me. I am very happy with the switch in energy supplier and uSwitch have saved me lots of money. 
5220|really impressed with the service I got from Shaheeda @ Uswitch today. she was informed, accurate and personable - excellent stuff.
5221|I went on another price comparison site before I tried uswitch, but the other one asked vague questions which did not have provision for giving actual kWh figures and the results were unclear.  With uswitch the questions were all straightforward and the drop-downs had the options I needed.  The results were readily comprehensible with all the detail required.I had just discussed the figures with my husband and we agreed to go with the firm quoted as best, when our phone rang and Chevaun from uswitch was there offering to help and explain.  She checked the quotes for herself, and confirmed the figures I had obtained on line, explained all the rates and conditions and organised the whole switching process for us.  It only took a few minutes to make the switch and I did not have to make any calls myself or hang on listening to music and pressing keys, trying to get to a real person, as happens with so many call-centres!  The documents will arrive from edf in a few days, and as long as we are happy with it all and do not cancel in the 'cool down' time, the switch over will take place in 4-6 weeks, without us doing anything more.  She even set up the direct debit for us, ready for when the new account begins.With switching over being so easy and efficient, I do not know why anyone passively allows their electricity supplier to keep upping the price, without checking whether they are really getting a good deal.  Just look up your existing bills, find out how many units you consumed in the past year, and key in the figures.  We have economy 7 with day and night tariffs, but the uswitch site copes with the different tariffs and the huge number of different 'deals' available from each supplier.  The electricity companies have so many different rates, in the hope that you will become totally confused and give up!  Don't let them get away with it.  We have saved nearly GBP300 by not trustingly staying with our present supplier.  They all offer good terms when you first join, but you have to check each time your agreed contract runs out, or you will find the price is creeping (?leap-frogging?) up!
5222|had a pleasant discussion with knowledgeable Ian.provided me with the information i was seeking and more,he was very friendly and sincere,glad he called.i would certainly inform others.
5223|Wanted to save money on my gas/electric npower bill for this year as the price/assumed usage has just gone up. Entered details in clear and simple fields on Uswitch site and best-offers quickly presented. I chose a deal and was in the process of completing the details when I received a call from Sales and Support Team colleague [name removed]. He talked me through options and guided me to an even better deal than the website had to offer. He was very courteous and knowledgeable. As a result I chose EDF over Swalec, not saving as much money each month (but saving over npower) but gained a deal with no-price-rise to June 2014 and no early termination fees (and electricity backed by low-carbon generation as well). Couldn't have done it so well without [name removed].....so big thanks to you [name removed]!!). 
5224|Fantastic customer service from Fatema Khanom. She was extremely helpful, clear and concise. Easy process and hopefully ill be making substantial savings. Thanks.
5225|The Customer Service Representative, [name removed], was extremely polite,courteous and helpful. His friendly manner made it all so easy, and he explained each and every step throughout the procedure. He helped a pair of pensioners make the correct choice. Thank you so much.
5226|I could not have wished for a more pleasant conversation on the telephone from the young man who called about changing my supplier for gas and electricity.  I was treated with total respect with everything explained very clearly in an extremely polite and well informed way,and I wish that every service followed this example of good customer care and customer service as it would make the world a better place.Thank you so much for all your help and I will be recommending this service to absolutely anyone.Tina Chave
5227|Sincere thanks to Joe for his patience with this old fogey! Such a relief to speak to a person who patiently listened and then gave me advice needed without fuss. He showed great empathy and understanding whilst explaining in simple terms the best deal for me. I highly recommend this website and in particularly Jo - many could learn from his excellent telephone manner.    
5228|"This is the second time I've used uSwitch and have been happy both times.  You get to speak to someone very quickly - no pressing countless buttons to just get speak to someone.  The advice is helpful and relevant to your individual circumstances and the operators have been polite and don't make you feel rushed or ""just a number"".  I would definitely recommend using them.  "
5229|Joe was thoroughly professional, smart and versatile. I felt he understood my situation and that he was full of enthusiasm and genuinely cared and wanted to help.He solved my problem, and I am delighted.Thank you Joe.
5230|Thanks for all your help Joe. I found the advice helpful and will use Uswitch in future. Hans :) 
5231|What can i say.I really felt Joe was on my side and he gave more than just a damn.This guy had a passion for his job!This guys advice was better then other peoples advice i have paid for in the past! 10 out of 10!!!!!!
5232|Joe knows what he is talking about and gets it across . Great help with junderstanding this unecessarily complicated business . was happy for him to switch me to the coop .
5233|Great service, thanks for all your help Joe. Went through everything with a  fine tooth comb. Simples! 
5234|I think U switch is brilliant.  Your advisorJoe was so so helpful to me.  As a pensioner I am really up against it financially and electricity and Gas are critical to me in budgeting.  He was extremely helpful and I will recommend U switch and him to anyone  - thanks
5235|The website wsa very easy to use but I had a query on finding my gas metre number and was then advised on the phone that the best deal on the site was not really the best deal. The service over the phone was execellent but I don't understand why the deal recommended over the phone is different from the web site recommendation and this has made me wary of using the site in future
5236|Stefanie Hwata helped to switch me with gas and electric, fantastic!Helpful, pleasant and above all efficient, need I say more.
5237|The advice I was given made me aware of fixed prices and variable prices and I trusted the advice I was given as it was impartial. I liked the fact that I could talk to someone prior to contacting the company themselves. 
5238|I wanted to change gas and electricity suppliers and spoke to Joe who was well informed and also listened to what I wanted from a new supplier.
5239|Spoke with Joe who advised me of all the options, he was happy to send me elsewhere if it meant that it was a better deal for me.  I decided after Joe's advice to go for a smaller saving with greater chance of long term stability in a volatile market.Thankls Joe, you earned your bonus!Glyn
5240|Speaking with Joe gave me reassurance that I was making the correct choice of energy providers, he was extremley pleasant, helpful and gave great customer service, something which I think is lacking within most industries. He is a credit to USwitch.
5241|spoke to ersan halil yesterday,just wanted to say he made my switch very easy and painless,very friendly and helpful.superb service well done ersan. whatever your giving ersan you should bottle it.)i will now tell all my friends about u switch.cheers ersan great job.very happy customer cheers rob
5242|Just spoke to Joe there to change my service provider for the gas and electricity and he was brilliant. Well spoken, very knowledgeable and gave me lots of advice for the future when looking for providers. Talked me through everything that was going on and was just brilliant all round. Would definitely recommend this service to anybody else out there and I hope you get Joe on the phone!
5243|I dealt on 2 separate occasions with Rui & Joe from U switch & found them both to be extremely helpful.They provided valuable information which I'm convinced will save me a lot of money & were happy to point out the pros & cons of potential deals rather than simply suggest the cheapest(on paper)options. Highly recommended..    
5244|Spoke to Joe when asking advice about switching electricity provider. He made it painless and concise. Joe answered all my questions patiently and clearly, and took the time to explain the reasons behind the calculations. He was efficient and polite - can't recommend him highly enough.
5245|Just been provided with the best helpline/customer service by Daniel D of Uswitch switching utility provider for my 81 year old mother in law. Having had nightmare service from Scottish Power and First Utility, Daniel made the process of changing supplier as easy as it should have been. He provided clear, direct, helpful advice. He tried to get the MPRN  number from the useless voice activated system. I tried to. Absolutely hopeless 0870 number.Eventually, I got the number from Scottish power after loads of calls to both suppliers.Daniel called back exactly on time on 3 occasions when I did not have all the required info at my fingertips.Thanks Danel D. Brilliant, friendly service.
5246|Dealt with Daniel D to sort out changing energy suppliers for my 81 year old mother in law. Daniel gave the best service I have ever received from any  helpline/customer service. He was clear, direct, helpful and provided callbacks exactly when he said he would. Brilliant. Made the whole process easier than the energy suppliers did!!Well done and thanks.John P
5247|Joe was polite, spoke very clearly, and gave plenty of opportunity to ask questions. Furthermore, he knew the answers to my questions.I would definitely recommend the service to my friends.
5248|Rang today to switch energy suppliers and was very happy by the help I received from Jon.  Made it very easy to do.
5249|Each time ( several times) my Gas & Electricity supplier were up for review I have visited various comparison sites, but always found USwitch to be the best. On this occasion Sohail Ahmed known as JON, was very efficient in discussing the various tarrifs and suppliers, and arranging the switch. 
5250|Very good website to find good deals to save some money.
5251|First class very helpful great saving!!
5252|Just made the switch of my gas and electric to the Co-Op with the help of a very professional guy from USwitch.  The operative called Joe (Sohail) had a very professional and balanced manner and my confidence was increased by his apparent knowledge of the switching process and clear guidance.On the worked example we ran it looks like my annual savings will exceed GBP200 per year, I equate that to giving me one month of Council Tax payment  well worth the short time I spent on the phone with Joe. (I did appreciate the fact that the phone call was not rushed and was free using a 0800 number). I have not switched my gas and electricity suppliers during all my time at my current residence  well over 20 years but never felt my loyalty to the SSE and BG was ever recognised by them. In fact the way SSE gave such poor service when I submitted bills to them for FIT and were extremely slow and reluctant to pay up  that showed me what a mug I had been  and finally pushed me to make the switch.I was please to switch to an ethical company with integrity. I really like little touches like the free 0800 customer services line  this just tells me this company value their customers. (Compare SSE who switched from 0800 numbers to premium rate customer service numbers  they expect you to pay for calling to tell SSE about their shortcomings  clear message on the value of customers to SSE)
5253|Just taken the jump to moving suppliers and so far it been as easy as anything (should save GBP300). If the rest of the process goes like the first part that would be great. I'll update the review when Im finished the moving process. The USwitch site is so easy to use and their representative, I got a guy called Joe(Sohail) who input all the data for me,,, knew what he was talking about,, was efficient and polite and was able to answer all my questions without transferring me to someone else. When was the last time that happened when I called a call centre!!!!!Well done USwitch and Joe
5254|Spoke to representative over the phone who was polite, friendly and very helpful.Would recommend the representative and the website again.
5255|Took all the hassle out of my gas/electric switch....very knowledgeable operator who was quite happy to take lots of time and discuss all the options.  Explained everything very well and very friendly as well.
5256|Great customer service from Jo (Sohail), explained everything I queried without getting twitchy and went further after analysing part of my property portfolio recommending me the most suitable supplier not only in saving money but value of the new supplier from current. Further on Jo made the switch swiftly without having to make other calls, all done on one platform. Convenient and effective. Definately recommend all to analyse energy suppliers every 6 months or so and staff at Uswitch make it happen without difficulty. I believe more companies should incentivise and if Uswitch doesn't I can't understand why such a non profit impartial advice company motivate their staff as their service actually does go that little bit further and deserve more.
5257|Got a renewal letter through from npower and decided to go online and have a look and see if I could get a better deal on my business electricity. Came across uswitch for business, filled in their form and got a call back pretty much straightaway. they even switched my gas contract too, and in total i saved about GBP800! Would recommend to anyone, was so simple.
5258|Very easy to do.  Suprised me.  Very helpful guidance provided
5259|Generally i hate speaking to someone at the other end of the phone at a customer services department because i always feel they never really care about you and don't really want to go that extra mile to help; but i have to admit the U-Switch team and in particular a guy called Rui Santos was excellent, very polite and very helpful; a breath of fresh air compared to the others, thank you.
5260|easypeasy even for computer idiots like me-also nice to have a phone number if u get stuck or just prefer to speak to someone-when i did ring the guy was very helpful-already recommended the service to a pal who happened to be knocking on the front door while i was completing the process-but remember u do need to have your bills in front of umikemidlands
5261|Just contacted USwitch and their Customer Care Team Joe was very helpfull and swiftly guided me thriugh the switching process along with a good saving.  Joe was very knowledgable and helpfull, the process was trouble free - many thanks   Steve W. (Huddersfield)
5262|Mario at Uswitch took my call today. I had tried using their website  to compare gas/electric prices (as i have done so previously) but due to now being a very low gas user the site was unable to give me quotes. Mario was very efficient and helpful (despite his computer crashing)taking my contact number in case we got cut off so he could call me back. Completed the comparison quickly and also all the formalities. He was very clearly spoken, i didn't have to ask him to repeat anything, he checked i understood everything too, pointed out the very important parts, was poilte & courteous. I am now swapping my fuel supplier and Uswitch have saved me GBP168 per year. Thank you.... now to do my internet and phone :-)
5263|I had a slight issue with another member of the team, who had done some calculations wrong. When I found the mistake, I called USwitch to start the process again and this time i was fortunate enough to be put through to Joe. He explained everything so clearly, and was very fair and un-pushy when describing all my different options. As for USwitch themselves, the whole process was quite simple, and stress free, despite the aforementioned miscalculation. I will definitely go through them again, and would recommend that anyone thinking of changing supplier, use a professional service, like USwitch, to guide them through the many different companies and their tariffs. 
5264|My partner first spoke to joe at uswitch and had told me how heplpfull he had been... After making our minds up on the plan we wanted to go with.. I phoned back and asked to speak to Joe i got a phone call back in about 15 mins.. As i didnt talk to him the first time he went over everthing again. He was very clear and i could understand what it was going to cost me...  Not like i had before from another company giving me how many kilowatt a hour i was gonna use as that dont mean a thing to me... I was very pleased with this help and he has also said if i need anything else to just email him and he will call me back.. And with the service i got from him i know he will phone me back. Thank you very much for this help Joe
5265|I'd had a problem changing supplier online, but had excellent service from Joe when I called uSwitch. He was very efficient, pleasant and informative, unlike individuals from many other organisation I've phoned. Good to know that high quality customer service standards are still available to us customers.
5266|Joe was very helpful, polite and efficient and made the whole change over experience less stressful.
5267|wow what a great service what a brilliant person you are Joe, thank you so much for the great information and figures, I had my doubts but you have explained so well it was so clear and simple...thank you so much once again for saving me so much money 
5268|Joe was absolutely brilliant....what a pleasure to talk to such a friendly and well informed human being.  Terrific sense of humour whilst maintaining his professionalism at the same time...Joe, thanks, you're a star. i hope your employers recognise your qualities!!!!!I'm self employed and if I was going to have anyone working for me then it would be you. Thanks for being so patient with all my questions and explaining everything so clearly. Have a wonderful Christmas and thanks for helping with the rugby question!
5269|Brilliant customer service, ran through everything clearly slowly and answered any questions I had. If only more customer service representatives were this good it would make life a lot easier and more pleasant. A credit to the team well done Joe. 
5270|I am a very pleased customer thanks to Joe's advice. He was very polite and patient when explained all options. He found me the best gas/electricity switch to Eon, blue plan which has saved me over GBP20 a month. Joe was very helpful and extremely thorough, which reassured me that I had made the right decision to switch my suppliers. The best customer service I have had in years. If USwitch have a reward and recognition scheme I strongly suggest Joe's name to be put forward.
5271|Eon's latest price rise and introduction of a standing charge with no explanation or reason coupled with their wholly unfair estimation of the direct debit meaning I always have a huge credit is all too much.U switch gave me expert and professional advice and made changing suppliers easy. 
5272|I called up USWITCH because my contract was up for renewal for gas & electricity. I spoke to Sohail Ahmed and he was very helpful and gave me plenty of options. I was satisfied with the my energy switch and would use USWITCH again for anything else.Many Thanks
5273|Spoke with Connor this evening who helped me swap energy suppliers. He was extremely kind & helpful on what must have been a busy day following E-ONs price increase & people being encouraged to switch. It was refreshing to speak to somebody who genuinely wanted to help & didn't treat me as just another number in the call queue!
5274|Well informed, helpful and friendly service.   Well done.
5275|3 months after using Uswitch to switch energy suppliers that went smoothly, a young man called Daniel Dubovskis helped me organise my free case of wine from Virgin. Thanks for all the good customer service.
5276|thanks for all your help, you helped me to under stand my swich over great job lee conner
5277|Operator anticipated key points relevant to queryWas both friendly and professionalTook time to ensure customer understood what they are signing up for, and advice given about product didn't feel rushed or pressured.Operator seemed motivated to offer advice which might minimise hassle for customers ongoing access to information- offered and sent a follow up email and alternative phone numbers and links to support other elements of query.I would recommend this service based on my experience.
5278|Extremely helpful, Joe was very patient while i sorted through paperwork. He explained everything in plain english. Would recommend Uswitch to everyone, keep up the good work!
5279|I would like to comment on the service received from Joe at uswitch-He helped me in every possible way and if i was not sure of something he was very patient and understanding and made everything clear to change energy supplier  Well done JOE   Many Thanks
5280|Really pleased with the level of service received from Joe at Uswitch. He really explained the pro's and con's of the various options well. He was friendly, informative and clear about the differences between the options, which made choosing the most suitable option very easy. Thank you!
5281|Excellent experience - very helpful - very useful - polite 
5282|Having already compared my prices on Uswitch its always easier to speak with someone on the phone and get confirmation properly of how these prices are compared. I spoke with Sohail who was proficient and had extensive knowledge of all the products and prices. I didnt have any intention of changing straight away as I always like to do my research and review however Sohails convinced me very quickly around the differences and it made me make my decision about switching. I identified just how much money I could actually really save. So thanks Sohail for your promptness.
5283|It's such a confusing and long process of comparing energy suppliers, and found the website useful to compare prices, but to actually speak with someone and tell you what it all means makes the difference.I spoke with Joe from u-switch, who made the whole process of comparing and finding a better deal on my energy bills so easy and simple. He was professional and very helpful. In short time, I switched to a money saving tariff. He did all the hard work for me! I should have called them up sooner.
5284|I was dreading going through the confusing, long process of comparing and maybe switching energy suppliers, but  Joe from u-switch made the whole process of comparing and finding a better deal on my energy bills so easy and simple. He was professional and very helpful. Within minutes with his help , I switched to a money saving tariff. He did all the hard work for me! I should have called them up sooner.
5285|joe was great very helpful thanks joe regards mike jones
5286|Spoke to Joe who found me the best deal for gas and electricity within minutes.  Very impressed with his professionalism and courtesy.
5287|Had to phone in as web site refused my supplier numberOther sites show VAT inclusive componentsU Switch shows VAT exclusive, nonsensical for domestic users
5288|Stefanie very patiently and with great humor guided me to the best dual fuel deal suitable for my needs. I was looking for a short term solution in moving away from my current supplier, due to the usual dissatisfaction when a good deal ends, but Stefanie suggested a smarter alternative to the one I was considering and at the same time made me realize that being stuck in the paradigm of only considering the main stream suppliers was short sighted as well as self defeating.Many thanks.
5289|I spoke to a very polite person who made the whole project very easy. The person I spoke to explained everything in detail making sure I understood everything.
5290|Having been with British Gas for too long to remember, the recent price hike made me think about switching.  I went online and found a company that was offering almost GBP300 per year saving.  However, due to the rather complex nature of our electricity only supply, I thought I would phone U-Switch to talk through the process.  It was my good fortune to speak to Joe.  He was very patient despite the process and my questions taking nearly an hour (including a lengthy contract speech from my new supplier).  Joe answered all my concerns and I have secured a new supplier for a long fixed term.   I have already recommended U-Switch to my parents. 
5291|Joe was incredibly helpful and gave me all the options available informing me of the cheapest offer whilst highlighting any of the potential hidden extras.Very good to know there's a service available where you don't feel you're getting sold something you don't want!!!
5292|Whilst my wife and I are no longer in the first flush of youth, we are capable (mostly) of understanding the principles of cyberspace!  However, the current energy pricing market we find most confusing.  We need not have worried, a call to Uswitch put us in the very capable hands of Sohail Ahmed, otherwise known as (Super)Joe!!  We found Joe to be extemely knowledgeable and, more importantly, patient!  He was clear and concise; ensuring we fully understood the implications of each plan on offer. We trust his advice has provided us with the best deal for our particular circumstances.  Thanks Joe!!
5293|Over the last few years I have used uswitch to find a good energy supplier.However over the last couple of days of checking, the site refuses to accept there is a lower energy deal - even if i change the parameters!When i fudged the input parameters to ridiculous levels, finally it states it can save me money. But checking the list of suppliers, I am prevented from viewing the details of another deal with my current supplier!!!The site used to be brilliant, now its not.you sold out Uswitch. Now i'll be switching to another site.
5294|Yesterday I spoke to a man called Joe, who was very helpful and found me the best deal for my gas and electricity and it only took about 10 minutes. 
5295|Yesterday I had the pleasure of talking to Stef who was an absolute delight.  She was patient whilst I shuffled my paperwork around and gave me good long term advice.  I would definately recommend your company and I hope all of your staff are as helpful as the lady I was lucky enough to deal with.
5296|I have to say I had never switched energy supplier before but USwitch made it effortless for me. I never had to do anything they handled it all and it went like clockwork! The advise I was given when I rang up was second to none and I have been telling all my friends about it! They are all now checking out USwitch! They explained everything clearly and put me at ease having never switched before.I would recommed checking out their website and then ringing to talk to them if you need more assistance.I will definitely use their services again. Thank you USwitch!
5297|I spoke to Joe, got through first time I called, no waiting which was a bonus.I thought I had chosen a tariff online which would suit, but Joe expertly and confidently pointed me into the right direction and got me the best deal possible. He was curteous and knowledgeable and if I ever had to ring again I would wish I could speak to him directly as he seems a very reliable young man.Well done Joe. 
5298|Spoke to Joe who answered all my questions, no pressure of sales and very helpful and inciteful advice. If I ran my own company, I would employ Joe. he was courteous, profesional and explained everything in a clear and concise manner. Gave me time to make a decision and called back when promised. Joe is truely an asset to Uswitch
5299|Joe was very helpful indeed, and pointed me in the right direction to save money on my electricity bill.  His English was good, and he made the switchover very easy, answering all my relevant questions.   I would recommend Uswitch to anyone considering a move from their existing suppliers.  Excellent work!
5300|Extremely efficient (when I eventually got through to Uswitch after 4 attempts. I will be happy to award 5th star when the switch is finally made.James Levin, Poole, Dorset
5301|Conor Coleman helped me switch everything (expect gender). I have a feeling he's really good looking too. Not doubt men of his calibre are in very high demand. He sorted energy and gas prices like a modern day Jim'll Fix It and the reviews he writes about himself are absolutely fantastic too. Hats off to the guy. He is a one man uswitch machine and could really do with a raise!
5302|Very pleasanst and professional young man, very good manaers and has very goods interpersonnal skills. thank you
5303|"Called today as a technophobe O.A.P. needing help and reassurance.JOE WAS WONDERFUL!I was reassured that the on-line U-Switch I had done earlier in the week had actually worked and was being under taken as we speak.He explained the process carefully,and reassured me that the required ""on-line admin"" was simple.I only needed to log on 4 times a year and record my usage.He reminded me to make sure I cancelled the direct debit to my previous supplier.... and even suggested if I read my meter each month I would have an uptodate record of how my fuel consumption/bill was progressing with no nasty shocks.What a kind considerate young man.A great asset to your company! Thank you from A Very Happy O.A.P."
5304|I probable like yourself reading this was unsure at first about using U Switch. With nothing to lose I checked on-line, it took about 1 Min, then being me, I was still unsure that I could really save so much money.  I thought that I would give U Switch a call just to check.They answered quickly and politely.I spoke to Stefanie and she guided me all the way through what I was seeing on-line and we checked together to make sure I was saving as much as I could.I Switched in just one phone call and now have piece of mind that im getting a great deal.I couldn't recommend U Switch high enough to anyone.  Stefanie was AMAZING!! although im sure all there staff will be trained to such a high standard.Thank you for reading, now go save some money with U Switch. 
5305|Michael Hewitt gave me some excellent advice, and even though I ended up staying with my current supplier (unfortunately tied in!!), his advice helped me negotiate a better deal...a reduced monthly payment....and a refund for selling me the wrong product in the first place. When my contract ends with my current supplier, I will definitely be using U Switch to get the best deal.
5306|If you sign up with this lot make sure you don't cancel anything bcoz after we cancelled they still took GBP40 out off our account without asking And charged us GBP50 due to lost commission, and are now taking us to court because we refuse to pay the GBP50 for lost commission and the fact they took GBP40 out doesn't count, every letter we now receive from them they charge us an extra GBP15, rip off
5307|I needed to ensure that my elderly Mother was getting the best Electricity and Gas deal as her total annual spend was over GBP5000. U Switch saved GBP1000.The call was handled in a very professional manner and the plan was tailored to my Mother's requirements.
5308|Having just come to the end of my last energy deal, I contacted uSwitch.com & I'm really pleased I did because I have saved myself a couple of thousand pounds on the deal that the chap called Michael Hewitt from uSwitch.com found and recommended for me. He was really helpful and answered all my silly questions - he even ringing me back when a better deal came on the market. I would recommend everyone to use uSwitch.com if you want to save money and get a very professional independent service.
5309|Conor dealt with my call really well and made the whole process clear and simple. Just wish I'd switchd ages ago - didn't realise it would be so hassle free!!My only small criticism was the length of time it took for my call to be answered (just under 10 mins) ..... but as there's just been a TV programme on about the benefits of switching, I guess half the country had the same idea as me.Once answered, I couldn't fault the service I received.
5310|Having just come to the end of my previous deal,i contacted uswitch and i'm really pleased i did because i have saved myself a couple of hundred pounds on the deal that the chap called Michael Hewitt from uswitch found and recommended for me He was ever so helpful and answered all my questions,even ringing me back when a better deal came on the market.I would recommend everyone to use uswitch if you want to save money and get a professional independant service.
5311|"Having visited uSwitch.com after reading the incredible reviews posted here,  I am really impressed with the site. It's obviously one of the more established brands in the price comparison site space and it's pedigree shines through. I remember using it a long time ago, but I think ""It's ever better now""! The unique and engaging editorial content, the effortless navigation, the wide variety of products all arranged in a logic manner are breathtaking. They are clearly still a league apart from the other amateurish money switching websites around. I would recommend this website to anyone - don't bother going anywhere else!"
5312|The gentleman I spoke to was both knowledgeable and friendly and was happy to explain how the changeover processs would work.   
5313|We are dealing with a double whammy of cancers in our home. both my husband and myself. So to add insult to injury my standing order has just gone up from GBP80 per month to GBP228. we are now on a very fixed income and things were to say the least difficult. I really didnt know what to do.   Then I was recommended to U-Switch and I met Connor. what a star. he listened, advised and finally found me a really fair deal, fixed price till march 2014. He was lovely and kind and so easy to talk to.    I wouldn`t hesitate to recommend them, and intend to tell all my friends to give them a ring.    Regards,    Jean Carr
5314|Like most people, switching suppliers is always something you plan on doing but always find something more interesting to do. The hardest part is working out what you have used. Once you have done this it is plain sailing. We added up our usage over the 12 months and entered these details onto the uswitch website. The comprehensive results came back immediately. My advice is to pick up the phone at this stage and speak to one of the advisors. If you are lucky enough, you may get Wayne, he was great and very patient. A quick call and all is done. You are in safe hands with these people. Highly recommend.
5315|I decided to switch via uSwitch because I had had such a good experience with them last year.  I did a lot of research first re which was the best fuel supplier for me, but I wanted to talk it through with uSwitch before making the final decision.  I was a bit nervous of actually making the online switch myself and I knew uSwitch would be very helpful.  I was not disapointed. Stefanie discussed the details with me and clarified everything for me, answering all my questions.  She then did the actual online switch for me while I followed what she was doing on the online forms.  She really put my mind at rest.  I asked her exactly what online paperless billing entailed and she explained it all to me so I know exactly what to expect. Its much easier than I thought - I just key in my metre readings every 3 mths! Likewise she explained exactly what happens next, and importantly gave me phone numbers including that of my new supplier, incase I need them.  Stef was friendly and pleasant to talk with.  Excellent customer service from uSwitch, and a big than you to Stef.
5316|I was coming to the end of my fixed rate deal, thus phoned uSwith for guidance regarding the best available energy deals. When it comes to guidance regarding energy deals  you could not be anymore religious by communing with uSwitch. I spoke to Stephanie, whom guided me through the morass of available deals, separating those Therms from those Kilowatt hours with such jovial dexterity. Weeks of procrastinating were cut a drift by Stephanie, and I signed up with a provider...... My grandmother decided to walk five miles a day when she was 75 years old in order to keep warm. Now she is 95 years old and we don't know where the hell she is. 
5317|Many thanks to Wayne for making things so easy, Very Helpful, I just needed to check a few details before completing form to change and he answered all my questions and offered to complete the change for me, He made the experience fun and I felt like a valued customer, he spoke clearly and explained the different options available. Will be using the service again Thanks
5318|I called uswitch's team with a query and explained my situation to the very helpful telephone representative. My query was dealt with utmost importance and in fact I ended up switching Gas and Electric provider straight away on the phone! The Customer service rep was empathetic with my problem and enormously helped in finding a suitable alternative. He ran a quote for me and explained about the different options available and helped me choose the most suitable option. Before ending the call, the rep had also provided me with details of next steps and how best to resolve my issue with my current provider. I feel that this kind of service is most needed in these times of austerity. Customers need to be confident that the advice given to them id unbiased and uswitch's team manages to do that and more! I would happily recommend this service to all my friends and family.Thank you Uswitch team :)
5319|I decided to phone U-switch, to see if I could get a better deal on my energy prices.  I spoke to Connor, who was amazing, he quickly took a few details, gave me very clear impartial advice and told me which deal was the best one for me, there was never any high pressure selling it was just a very easy and straighforward procedure.  He was very polite and answered all of my questions, he even advised me to ring my old energy company to make sure that I remembered to claim the refund that they owed me on my gas and electricity, and also to cancel my direct debits.  I will definitely be recommending U-switch to my family and friends.
5320|I was able to explain my query and it was responded with positive outcomes. I am very satisfied by the choice/advice I was given. I also hope/think that I made a good decision. I was very please overall. What i appreciate I was given the opportunity to decide what was best quote for me without any pressure. That was explained to me in simple langauge, if I didnt understand, it was explained again to me, which I appreciate. Many Thanks.
5321|Delighted with service. Points clarified whenever required. Stef  certainly had a sense of humour when dealing with us.  Just hope if we ever need to use U Switch again we are lucky enough to have her answer our phone call.  Thank you.
5322|I had already decided what I was going to do but still had a couple of questions to be answered so as to be 100% sure of my facts.I spoke to a lady called Spef who was very polite, friendly & knowledgeable. She answered all my questions and guided me through the change over process. It was very easy to do & would advise anybody to at least check the deals that are on offer as I have found out that loyalty does not always count for much. I will certainly be using USwitch again. Thank you.
5323|After learning that my energy company was putting its prices up, I called uSwitch to find the best available deal.Having been totally confused about prices and plans, Mario explained everything to me and nothing was too much trouble for him.I have recieved excellent service!Thank you Mario - keep up the excellent work.
5324|liked that someone rang me within a couple of hours of sending query. very clear about what addiitonal info needed. replied to my providing info within a few hours and less than 24 hours after original query have switched to cheaper provider. Shaheeda Khan, your operator, very clear and helpful.
5325|Fatima called me and asked a few questions and came up with 2 options - recommending one in particular.Fatima was very efficient and the switching of providers was a very simple, painless process.I highly recommend using Uswitch.
5326|Wayne Campbell dealt with my switch from British Gas to Scotish Power.in a business like and friendly efficient manner. It was a pleasure to switch with U Switch due to the way my request was handeled.Thank you.
5327|Well informed and easy to talk to Customer Care Consultant (Conor C) made the whole process painless and straight forward. Glad I contacted uswitch by phone as the discussion highlighted things I had overlooked. This helped be to look beyond what the internet showed as the current cheapest and consider what would be cheapest longer term.Thank you Conor.
5328|Decided to go ahead with switching my energy supplier after working out how much next years bills will cost. I thought it was going to be a long, drawn out complicated process, couldn't have been more wrong! Conor was helpful, friendly, and very easy to chat to. He made the whole process as painless as possible and above all else, he made me feel comfortable about asking questions and sorting any queries I may have had. All in all very pleased and happy. Thanks again !   
5329|I thought I'l switch supplier southern electricity to scottish power, and Connor Coleman delt with my case.Connor told me everything i needed to know from switching to how much i could save etc. Very help full and very clear, certainly recommend to any one who wants to switch.Made a saving estimate of GBP470.00p
5330|I have used uswitch for a few years now and logged on yesterday to compare energy prices.It was hard for me to compare the various offers, standard charge, cost per unit etc and I was almost on the point of giving up when I noticed the chat facility.I text an advisor and said I was having difficulty comparing the different tariffs and she asked if she could ring me. She explained things very clearly, asked me what I would prefe,r eg fixed price deals, then found the best deal and completed the transfer for me immediately.So much easier to understand the offers when speaking to someone who knows! Many thanks uswitch you've saved me money again!
5331|I used U Switch 6 years ago and the process was easy and made substantial savings. I have just repeated the procedure and hopefully the change over will be just as smooth this time. Cannot see any reason why anyone would not wish to make a saving on there energy supplier. Advisor was very helpful.
5332|I found switching very easy indeed and didn't take long.  Wayne Campbell was very customer orientated and answered all my queries very efficiently.  He supplied me with all the detail I required in order for me to make an informed decision to switch.  Thank you.
5333|Having phoned your company for more advise i spoke to a young gentleman called Wyane Campbell. Wyane put me at ease with his clear and helpful knowledge of your firm.He took time to explain the options i was enquiring about, it was a pleasure to have him on the other end of the phone. What an asset for you.I wish there was more people like him on the other end of the phone
5334|I wish every customer services had someone like Wayne to help us oldies so patiently and polightly,he defin'ately had an influence in my decision to move providers because you judge a company by first impressions.I am now looking forward to joining you,thank you Wayne.regards,Brenda keeley.
5335|I was browsing online just thinking about changing my electricity and gas supplier. I had a quick look at Uswitch, but wasn't sure so logged out. Within half an hour, a Uswitch representative rang me, and went through some details with me. He was really helpful, and I felt confident that switching companies was the best thing. I will be telling all my friends how speedy and helpful Uswitch were.
5336|It was a joy to speak with someone I could easily understand who explained things clearly without beinghorribly deferential or, the opposite horribly patronising.  There was no pressure whatsoever and eachoption was explained clearly, and repeated patiently when I failed to keep up with the detail.  Our particularrequirements were understood and addressed quickly and I have every confidence that the supplier we selectedtogether with deliver what we want at the price we want  - giving us huge savings on our previous supplier andbetter additional conditions and service.  I was also left with a name and phone number to contact in the eventof any problems or queries, which isn't always the case.  Changing suppliers for utilities is often a nightmare whichis why I avoid it - on this occasion, so far anyway the USwitch experience was encouraging and a pleasure.
5337|My call was taken promptly, by someone who was patient in explaining the options and issues, clearly understood the advantages and disadvantages of the various alternatives very well and was thus able to give constructive and sensible input. No decision was forced upon me; I was left to make up my own mind, but could do so feeling I truly understood the implications of the options available. Very helpful indeed and gave me great confidence.[Adviser Wayne Campbell]
5338|Rui Santos provided very usefull and clear information which helped me switch energy suppliers
5339|Had a question after trying to complete online transfer from electricity companies and Rui-the advisor-  couldnt have done any more. He was pleasant, helpful and very efficient and to be honest I think it would be easier just to phone up in future rather than online. He also explained things well and was straight to the point with the details.
5340|The advisor (RUI) explained the options and benefits of suitable plans and helped me save money versus my current supplier AND fix the price for 15 months with no penalty. BRILLAINT THANKS RUI.
5341|Dealing with Wyane was the best all my questions answered with out any red tape jargon all he had to say was clear and to the pointThis was the best over the telephone deals I have ever done A total credit to your Company M.R.Stoate
5342|Checked the website today, put in my details and got a call from Ershan within about 20 minutes.I was dubious at the start but Ershan explained the situation with recent Tariff changes and it was soon obvious I could make a decent saving. In fact I think he slightly Under-estimated what we'll save in the long term, but this is 1000x preferable to Over-estimating.I normally get lost in the Maths of Tariffs, especially with Day & Night rates etc, but Ershan explained it clearly, did the maths for me, then explained how he got there and let me think through it myself.Really great job! & one of the rare occaisions I actually enjoyed this kind of call! Give the man a Prize!
5343|I would like to thank Michael for his patience and understanding while I was speaking to him on the telepone last week. I have now changed my duel heating account because of all his help and will have no hesitation in recommending him to fiends and family. My payments until April 2014 have been reduced considerably from what E On Staywarm had quoted until DECEMBER 2013.The only thing I am not too happy about is having to do it on line. I am not very good with conputers but I shall have to ask my daughter is I to help if I have difficulty.
5344|First time user of USWwitch.Spoke to there help desk and spoke to to  Alma Uddin.First class help- why cann't all call centres be as helpful? By coincidence also called by the same lowest cost provider but as Alma was so helpful I have switched using USwitch, as without them the providers prices would be even higher 
5345|I have just switched with uSwitch and found the advice given over email and on the phone to be very helpful. If I have just gone with the cheapest option on their website I would have had cancellation fees and not had the price locked in for as long so am very grateful they pointed this out to me. All was done on the phone in a few minutes, couldn't be easier.
5346|Just swithed gas and electric to a much better deal saving me money instantly. The lady who took the call was polite and very professional. Great service all round 10/10, would be happy recommending their services. Alan Skinner Fleet Hants..
5347|Clear description of available products. Time was taken to go through the best plan to suit our requirements. I was most impressed with the service offered. 
5348|"I have been using one energy company for the last six years and have always been a bit reluctant to change because life experiences have brought about a bit of a cynical view in that the ""grass is not always greener on the other side"". Nevertheless, I knew I needed to review my energy charges and so went in search of better prices on the internet.  I found USwitch, which was easy to use and got a comparison where a different energy company could save me some money if I went with their package.  I was a bit dubious about the whole thing and decided to call USwitch with some questions.  Stefanie Hwata took my call and was really helpful.  I felt that she answered my questions honestly and with no bias.  I didn't feel that any of my questions were avoided and Stef went to the trouble of looking into some of my questions to determine the correct answer.  She established very good communication with myself and felt that she had my best interest at heart. There were some basic things I didn't quite understand about my energy usage and bill which Stef helped to sort out for me.  I would recommend using USwitch and if in any doubt give them a call to set your mind at ease.  Make sure you understand the service you are changing to and make sure you compare apples with apples. I know for sure that Stef would help you to clear up any confusions.I realise that I may have to review my energy services after a year as I have signed up to a package with a price freeze (lucky I did as prices are due to go up soon again).  But I will be coming back to USwitch to make sure I get the best deal."
5349|Having used the USwitch site I am now being plagued by marketing telephone calls from the UK and overseas several times a day. Unamused.
5350|Returning to the UK after a while and I was not sure about how to get the best deals for new suppliers.Contacted USwitch over the chat system and Stefanie Hwata called me back to establish my needs and find me the best deal.Stefanie was great, helpful and friendly, I strongly recommend the service to anyone looking for new services or switching to new suppliers.
5351|Looking to save few sterling I let myself to be taken off guard and switched to O2. This was a mistake, I should have know better. At a pint of sale I was promised gold but ended with sand...I'm a heavy corporate user - heavy as in working with visualisation, sorce contro and other boring stuff, I'm pushing and pulling files of 20-100GB at a time. O2 sales suggested The Works package as suitable. My IT requires me for number of reasons to use two static IP addresses which seems not be an issue at the sales time.Now is the roller-coaster:Day1My service has been switched from BT business a day of schedule - surprise, surpriseDuring reconfiguring my router with the O2 support I learned that I can only have ONE IP address. My corporate IT swallowed a pill a lessen the traffic requirements.Since that day my connection start retraining itself every 10-15 minutes (try to push or pull a larger file when the retry is not available). I raised a call with 02 support hoping for a quick solution.Day2 - 02 excuses; switching between faceplate and filter, test socketDay3 - O2 excuses; the same , line reduced to 5m ang 9k with some testDay4 - O2 excuses; After researching (using Vodafone PayG USB dongle) on O2 support website I found that the problem could be related to the O2's network changesDay5 - O2 excuses; O2 switched me to a dynamic IP - all seem to be working fine except: I'm unable to connect to my corporate network since I do not use a static IP address any more. All my corporate mail I'm trying to send is bounced back as SPAM!Day6 - O2 excuses; the same as Day5, line restored to it's destine speed. My company warned me that my employment is ta risk since my clients complaint to my company that my job is not being done or completed in time.Day7 - Today - disgrace. I'm short in words. O2 can not pass me to knowledgeable people as they are not allowed to!Sales did their best to convince me to do the move. Once they've got to my pocket you can read the rest; they do not give a slightest.
5352|Having previoulsy been dubious about comparison / switch services I was a bit unsure about using USwitch... however what a pleasant surprise. The website was easy to use and navigate bt I wanted to talk to someone so called their 0800 number. The phone was answered really quickly and the guy answering was really lovely! Mario was really helpful and explained everything brilliantly. I am now a convert and would recommend them to my family and friends.
5353|I have found U-Switch a very helpful.  I have used U-switch last year, and they found me a very good electricity & gas package.  I decided to used them again.  I spoke to Mr Mario Demitrio, who was extremely helpful, patient,and very polite.  He found me the best electricity & gas package to suit my needs. I do not have a lot of time to spend a lot of time on the computer, and prefer to speak to someone on the telephone who can help me to go through the process.  I would most certainly recommend U-switch to my friends and family.rochan razavi  
5354|I made a call to uswitch today with regards to my electricity and gas supply. I am quite the elderly lady with very little computer knowledge, (hence my daughter is writing this now.) So when I called uswitch, my call was handled by a young man called Souhail. The service he provided was excellent. I must admit I bombarded with him so many questions, and left him hanging while I consulted my husband, yet he was patient and able to answer all my queries. He went through all the details about each of the plans and I was able to make a brilliant switch to a different supplier, one that had so much more to offer. The lad had to repeat himself several times due to my poor hearing, but I would like to thank him and uswitch for this great service!
5355|This was the first time I used Uswitch. The lady I spoke to was polite, friendly & understood all my concerns. I clearly stated the type of providers I wanted & I got two recommendations that I would not have found by Internet surfing. Both providers were found & 'signed' up with within the same call. Now that's what I call sufficent working!!
5356|I am not particularly computer literate but i was so impressed by the patient and efficient service provided by U -switch. My contact was Jonathan Hill who was brilliant. He talked me through all the process and was delight to deal with - thank you so much. I will definately recommend to friends.
5357|I've just been speaking with and taking advice from Miles regarding switching my gas and electricity suppliers. He proved to be very knowledgable, curteous and polite and explained the process well. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble and he ran through the pros and cons of individual plans. Top marks for customer services. Can he be cloned and sent to British Gas customer services please?  
5358|I had a query about the information supplied to me, online, by USwitch. Spoke to a lady named Anastasia Tanas who, after investigation, identified the problem as an error on my part. If I started my own company I would offer her a job. She was that good!I switched suppliers, using USwitch, last year and found them efficient and informative. I will almost certainly use them again this year if I decide to switch.
5359|My phone call was taken by Stephanie Watwa- what a very lovely girl she is - so patient and extremely helpful.  I was a bit dubious about switching as I have never done this online - the last time I changed suppliers was 2 years ago when a rep cold called at my door and I fell for his talk.  This time I was a bit more savvy.  I was extremely pleased with everything Stephanie told me - she talked everything over very carefully with me and I have already recommended your company to my sister and my son.  Thank you so much for you help. I am just sorry I didn't realize I could have arranged to switch 3 weeks before my present fixed contract expired, but I'll know the next time if and when I want to change suppliers.
5360|"Took advantage of Free Wine Offer-had a delay in receiving wine and had to do the dreaded call to a Call Centre! Spoke to a chap called Miles-couldn't do enough for me. Couldn't immeadiately resolve problem as had to speak to manager but promised to call me back the next day which he did. It was clear he had ""gone that extra mile"" to sort my problem. Courteous, true to his word and very unlike alot of my Call Centre experiences!  If there's a staff reward scheme, bonus or performance marking and USwitch management are reading this Miles is certainly worthy!Mr S Pinchbeck (Leicester) "
5361|I wanted to get a better deal on my electricity and gas and was helped grately by Jonathan Hill from Uswitch who explained to me the process of switching easily and saved me money!
5362|I have just spoken with a young man called Rui from Uswitch.Extremely helpful and gave me great advice and saved me money . Excellent service from a very knowledgeable young man . Thankyou for all your help .Adam T
5363|I just set up an energy provider on my new home and the service was excellent.  I could not have done this online as the move from one home to another was not straight forward as our old house is going to be set up as a holiday home.  The communication was so much better with the personal touch and Stef with an eff was brilliant throughout.Obviously no one likes having to listen to the legal jargon, but after promising not to fall asleep when she read through these bits it was all done and dusted, a big tick from me.
5364|I used the site this morning.  Its extremely easy to use.  I have just saved myself GBP400..for only 5 minutes effort!I then rang the call centre who took me through the process step by step.  I spoke to a young man (Rui Santos) who knew his stuff.  He took the time to talk me through the pros and cons of each utility supplier and was extremely knowledgable.  We often complain when things go wrong but are less willing to talk about good customer service - U switch deliver exceptional customer service - well done!
5365|Excellent user friendly easy to understand and really straight forward.
5366|I've used this site before and it's still as user friendly as ever. The questions are easy to answer as long as you've got your up to date readings and payment details. I'm over 65 and would recommend it's ease of use to anyone a little wary of using technology this way. I can't say there is any negative points to record.
5367|"If you want to see ALL the companies offering the service you are looking for you need to say NO to the question ""Show me plans I can switch to"" or something similarly worded.  As if you would be looking for plans you could not switch to - what would be the point?If you say NO to this, instead of seeing no plans at all, as you might expect, you get ALL the suppliers, including those who will NOT pay uSwitch a bean to be on the site. Ofgem and Ofcom both suggested that uSwitch change this, but they ignored it. "
5368|My British Gas tariff came to an end last week and I've been putting off looking for a new one until now.  Just made a cup of tea expecting the process to take ages looking at lots of different tariffs, weighing up the best one but it didn't.  Got it all done and dusted in a matter of minutes, saved GBP100 by switching to EDF and I've not even taken a sip of my tea yet.  Fingers crossed the switchover goes well!
5369|very easy to use site lts of options thanks again uswitch
5370|Nothing more to say than it was easy to switch to a new provider and I had to do the bare minimum of work.I am very happy with the service.
5371|British Gas offered me a paltry GBP50 at the end of my contract if I signed up with them for another year.I went to U Switch and they saved me GBP130 over the samwe year but also with a guarantee of no price rise for 15 months.Their site is so simple.  It takes about two minutes to complete the process
5372|Having spoken to a very nice lady called Naila on the phone I have just saved a nice sum of money on my usual bills (better in my pocket at the end of the day).. Not only that but the lady was extremely informative and very patient when dealing with all questions raised(Something I do a lot). My queries were answered with efficiency, confidence and patience, giving me the time I needed to make notes.All in all, compared to the call centers of some other companies, if this is an example of the attitudes fostered at Uswitch, then they are definitely doing something right.
5373|IT'S  OK....IT'S GOOD ....IT'S WORTH DOING ....IT SAVED ME MONEY ...
5374|Jonathan was very knowledgable, and helped me save a realistic GBP240 p.a.! Explained everything thoroughly, and answered all questions - thank you!
5375|mario rang after i had viewed onlinehis knowledge and advice was second to nonewith no hard sell,he gave a honest opinion on products good and bad points and also advice on the utility price rises across the boardmany thanks
5376|Really pleased Mark phoned me back and talked me through my best options. It's really hard trying to understand all the different tarrifs etc but uSwitch made it easier
5377|Having finally lost patience with my current supplier's baffling statements, I decided to shop around. USwitch found me a great deal, suited to my needs and added a free gift to boot.  On top of this the whole process took less than 30 minutes.The comparison table made it simple to compare the top line features of each product and saved lots of trawling through the pages myself.Excellent.
5378|I spoke to Mark at uSwitch.com.  He was very helpful, friendly and professional.  He assisted me with switching utilities suppliers. I will recommend uSwitch.com to my family and friends.  
5379|Out of all the price comparison sites, I found my experience on uSwitch the easiest by far! I've always been apprehensive about looking into the possibility of changing suppliers but this was painless and has brought me significant savings!!!
5380|I had previously been helped by Mark Carty and switched using the U Switch service - saved a bundle.  Received a call from him today to say that my existing agreement would expire in two weeks and that following that, the supplier would put me back to the standard tariff which would increase my costs alarmingly.  Mark immediately suggested a switch to an alternative supplier at slightly below the existing monthly cost and I accepted his advice.  I was so surpised at the pro active service offered by Mark and absolutely delighted that I was made to feel like a valued client.  Thanks very much Mark - great to deal with you and I will most certainly recommend you to friends and colleagues.
5381|"I wrote to Uswitch - here's my copy text:...to formally express my appreciation for the excellent service provided to me today by Matthew Theakston.I had spent quite some time online trying to evaluate the various options to switch my gas and electricity supply and eventually chose Uswitch as my springboard portal. I was most fortunate in speaking to Matthew. He was patient, considerate, empathetic, knowledgeable, personable and professional. I felt I was speaking to someone who really knew his stuff and not only was Matthew able to help me and answer my numerous (sometimes tedious) questions, but was also smart enough to anticipate and raise some issues that I had neglected to consider, and this was most fortuitous for me.Matthew has made great strides in helping to restore my faith in Customer Services. In today's automated, menu-process-driven, button-pressing, telephone-scripted, and fallaciously named ""customer service"" environment, it came as a very pleasant surprise to have my call answered by real person (and a very helpful, knowledgeable and personable one at that). What a very welcome change from the usual spirit-drooping, hope-crushing, and belief-withering 'services' that customers often experience.In my opinion, Matthew Theakston is a credit to your organisation."
5382|Mark Carty provided a top quality impartial service once again. Well done USwitch, keep up the good work. The calls were quick and to the point. USwitch followed up with me as promised on both occasions; can't really ask for more.
5383|Mark was very helpful & I saved over GBP100. by switching supplier. I liked the fact that I wasn't on the phone for ages everything was completed in about 10 minutes. I will be back next year for a new quite!!
5384|Mark explained eveything very welland answered all my questions,e.g.is there any standard charges.Answer no.Gave me his landline number for me to contact him which I did and we have agreed to go with you.Thank you. Cornelius Bracken
5385|Mark Carty followed up my visit to the uSwitch web site - I particularly liked the fact that he was not pushy, just helpful, but more importantly, knew what he was talking about in some detail; he was also easy to understand.I believe that Mark Carty identified the best deal for my requirements and circumstances, and made the whole process of switching painless.Never mind recommending to friends, I would recommend him to my family.
5386|"as usual , having problems understanding the cobbledeegook that is "" energy suppliers estimated quotes ""... then i got a phone call from a very helpfull guy...   explained so much and pointed out some of my errors in the questionair...think he,s got me a good deal..                                    john."
5387|Having spoken to Mark Carty I have now switched energy supplier with a great savings. He helped me with great patience through the process making it easy to understand. Very pleased. I will be advising all my friends to contact uSwitch.
5388|It seems that the deal for Sky is actually not very good -- initially the costs are lower but in the long term they are actually much higher than when booked directly via Sky.
5389|I was contacted by Mark Carty regarding switching my utility suppliers. His customer service is second to none. He is extremely knowledgeable and informative about the service, very professional, personable and courteous. I felt the whole process flowed with such ease that I could have chatted to him all night! A great asset to the organisation.
5390|Having received a phone call from u switch I was delighted with the information & courtesy shown to me by Mark Carty, he was both polite & informative, making the decision to switch very clear. Thank you for the information & professionalism.
5391|I rang to clarify a point while switching and Wayne Campbell offered to talk me through the process, filling out my form for me as he went. No pushiness or pressure - just polite, helpful and knowledgable. Much to be commended.
5392|I was very pleased with the service provided by Jonathan Hill last week, he answered my questions via the online talk box and then phoned me to talk me through finding the best supplier.I am very pleased with the service provided and the supplier I have gone with.U-switch make the whole process straight forward and impartial 
5393|I get very confused easy and Naila helped and explained everything for me! Very helpful and not pushy and explained detail clearly! She has restored my faith with internet comparisant comapnys. Naila must be a great credit to the team there! :)Thank you.Craig
5394|"Thank you Michael Hewitt, for helping me to switch over and change my energy supplier, as it will save me a fair amount of money.I have ""actually"" enjoyed our various chats,thanks for that, your patience,and good humor.It is so nice to talk to someone over the 'phone without feeling pressured into making an instant decision.Thanks againHave already recomended you.  "
5395|This is the first time I have ever used uswitch. I am very happy with the help I received from Michael.He rang back when he said he would and explained everything very clearly to me and took his time. I had got into a bit of a muddle trying to do it on my own! I would definately recommend this comparison site and I would use them again without hesitation. Thank you Michael.
5396|Thanks to excellent advice received from USwitch's Ken I was able to get nPower rescind their proposed increase in my monthly direct debit since the annual cost of my electricity as calculated by USwitch could not be contradicted.
5397|I looked at uSwitch as my bills were really big and I wasn't really understanding what my provider was talking about! Aaron Nelson, fantastic customer service! knowledgeable and informative, took the pain out of it for me! I'm confident that I now have a really good deal on a really confusing product! Plus, the recommendations and further info on other savings that I can make just made my day! Thank you :-) 
5398|As a first time buyer didn't really have a clue about rates etc.Spoke to Jonathan Hill for about 20 mins and he found us the best deal which was cheaper than what we had budgeted for. He gave clear advice and useful information. 
5399|Good customer service helpful staff explained in easy terms.
5400|I was delighted with the service I had from Jason Parmer - a very enthusiastic and most thorough young man - who let me speak, understood me and responded to my questions pleasantly and professionally. What a refreshing change!! (Having arranged to switch, I should save GBP200 + p.a. Fingers crossed!) Jason is so good that I've no doubt he'll be promoted out of 'telesales' or whatever they call it, into a more challenging role. If all the other telesales staff are as good as JP the uSwitch will do very well.
5401|I was happy when I first spoke to an agent who arranged to switch gas & electricity to a new supplier. Unfortunately he then did nothing about it and when I realised the promotional offer had expired.I then phoned and spoke to Shaheeda Khan who not only sorted out the transfer but also arranged for me to receive the offer ( Cheque for GBP80)Not only that the transfer went through without a hitch and Shaheeda maintained contact until all was sorted.This goes to show that making mistakes can happen it the best organisation but it is how you sort out the problem that sorts the men (or in this case lady) from the boys.Well done Shaheeda I will remember and use you again.
5402|i have just switched using u switch for the second time and also used there web site to switch my mothers utilities .in my opinion it is quite faultless ,and as a result im saving money oh and lets not forget the free wine offer with virgin wine (hic).everyone should do this its so easy a my mum will now be about GBP200 a year better off. cheers.
5403|The service and honesty in finding a plan for me was exceptional .... Would highly recommend !!
5404|I would never have managed to get myself out of the mire if I hadn't contacted you.Your service to both my daughter and myself has surpassed my expectations by a mile. Well done!!! I have restored my faith in the human race.Nothing was too much trouble and you also took time to explain fully what my options were. i know it isn't easy when you come across someone as long in the tooth as me so keep up the good work.
5405|I've just switched my energy supplier using U-Switch. I was led to believe that I would save GBP250 a year by switching to first utility. In fact I am now paying GBP3 a month MORE than I was before the switch!I feel that I have been misled and lied to. I would have given a no star rating if I could have. 
5406|On the Web results NPower was top, first:utility was second and Scottish Power third, and Mark directed me to Scottish Power as NPower had a standing charge, first:utility did not have much of a track record and Scottish Power had good customer reviews.  I wish I was sure Scottish Power really was the best choice.  Mark was helpful and seemed to know his stuff.
5407|(Name removed) was simply outstanding, he had the patience of a sniper in order to get the job done when i was busy with my own clients. only after several conversations with (name removed) did i then decide to switch my Electricity supply, if it had not been for (name removed) then i would have wasted a large figure of money over a 12 month period, he's well worth the pay cheque and is a credit to Uswitch and should get another award. top notch fella.
5408|(Name removed) is a star!  Switching from British Gas to Scottish Power and saving at least GBP42 on the existing tariff let alone the new one BT were offering!.  His customer service is second to none.   He is patient, does what he says he will do and is understanding and provides clear details.  He goes that extra mile by offering other solutions, such as Broadband and Solar Energy, both of which we are looking into together.  He is not pushy and I will have no hesitation in recommending him to friends and family.Many thanks.  Talk to you next week!Juliet.    
5409|When asked for present monthly payments it's not clear you have to enter the amounts WITHOUT the VAT! Which is what the prices quoted were based on so it's easy to be misled into thinking the quotes are cheaper than they really are. BEWARE! Because of this We ended up paying more when we were led to believe it would be less.This is how EDF have explained to me why we are paying more now than we were before we switched. They (EDF) have very kindly offered to let us out of our contract without paying the termination fee because of this so 5 stars for them.  
5410|I would like to say thank you to (name removed) for helping me save money by switching energy supplyers. (Name removed) also took the trouble to explain some of the terms that confused me,we had a laugh about where i'de be going on holiday with the money i would be saving.This young man has the perfect customer service attitude,polite,helpfull,easy to talk to.Thanks again,from Miss S Burrows
5411|(Name removed) was so kind and helpful. Nothing too much trouble. I am in my 70's but he was so patient and took the time and trouble to explain everything and run through it all with me,  So nice to speak to an actual person instead of a machine - and one that I could understand too.  His Mum must be very proud of him !!!!  I know I would be if he was my son. Many thanks for your help. Pat Biddle
5412|(Name removed) could not have been more helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for him and I appreciated the fact the he took time to explain things more than once when needed. It is a pleasure to deal with someone who lives customer service.  
5413|Tried to compare on line, but couldn't find my current plan so (name removed) rang me straight back and talked me through it, having me in fits of giggles most of the way through...should he be on stage instead of a call centre?!Anyway, smooth process, no hassle hopefully and again, hopefully, worthwhile.
5414|Ballsed up while using the Uswitch website... & called the Uswitch number to undo the damage.. I just thought it was going to be a number with a voice clearing up my mistake.Turns out the guy on the end is (name removed), who knew his shiz & couldn't help enough... Cancelled my mistake & then helped me with savings... opting for 2 completely different providers on his advice...This guy seems to know his stuff.. I guess I will find out in a few months with the savings a make or don't make..That didn't seem to worry him as he gave me his details & said I could get back to him with expenditure &/or readings after a few months & see if there were any better deals...Polite & friendly.. was in no rush to get me off the phone (like most companies do)I'm impressed...
5415|After a 16% hike in the annual charge for electricity, for the coming year, despite a 13% reduction in my consumption in the past year, I decided to try the uSwitch website.I encountered a problem when the tariff from my present supplier wasn't on the drop-down list and I couldn't proceed any further.I phoned the uSwitch helpline and after a few minutes was connected to (name removed), who very quickly and efficiently signed me up with a new supplier, at an annual saving of over GBP200.  Painless and efficient. Well done!
5416|I spoke to one of the most helpful customer services people I have ever used. Really helpful. Excellent service.I shall use uSwitch.
5417|Happy to finally find someone who talks to me as a human being over the web conversation, I found (name removed) friendly and knowledgable which made my switch a much easier process. i would definitley reccomend uswitch again as the customer service is superb and the lady i spoke to was an angel who went over and beyond for me as I am new to the internet.thankyou for saving me money and making me smile.
5418|Got a good quote online on your site but decided to speak directly about switching.My lucky day I got (name removed). Very friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Would not hesitate to recommend your site and (name removed) especially.Cannot comment on the switch over from British Gas to Scottish Power via Uswitch as this has not yet occurred.
5419|What i consider to be good customer services (in my humble opinion) is the honest, non patronising, flow of information between two human beings, where all questions are answered in full and you have full and clear confidence in the agent you are conversing with.  I found (name removed) from U-swith to be pleasant, very helpful, knowledgable and honest, many companies and customer service centers could take a rather large leaf out of his book.  If all of u-swich agents are as well versed and trained, I would and will recommend them to anybody. Thanks again 
5420|I was with my original supplier for 56 years, when my Wife died I found the monthly outgoing of GBP70 difficult to find. I was advised by Uswitch that Scottish Power would save about GBP240.00. Since I changed nothing has changed in my circumstances and they took two payments of just  GBP57 in what has been a cold quarter and have now increased my payments to GBP103.00.I thought the idea of D/D was to even out the payments over the year.I have now got three months of GBP103.00 before a review.I have no intention of staying with Scottish Power and will terminate at the earliest opportunity.
5421|Having used the U-Switch service to check for best energy deal I picked the 3rd best deal (gave the longest guaranteed discount period).  U-Switch predicted almost GBP400 per year saving i.e. 28%.After first quarter with SP (Winter bill so will be biggest of the year) actual saving is GBP6.37 (2.5%).And before the excuses appear - as an energy consultant I do know how to calculate my bills properly to get a true like for like comparison.Don't believe the figures predicted !!
5422|Used uSwitch to change energy supplier.  Everything went smoothly, no problems with the added bonus of a crate of wine.  Didn't get the voucher code in the alloted time but that was due to a change in e-mail address during the procedure.  Would definitely use again and recommend.
5423|signed up for orange broadband through uswitch and was ment to receive a GBP40 voucher i waited for 6 month and got nothing then i decided to contact customer services and ask why and got told that they would contact me to sort it all out in the next 24 hour but i waited a week go nothing so i call again and was told the same thing again. i called another for time after this each time getting the same response then one day about another 3 months on it just turned up no appology just the voucher ok i did get the  voucher but it must of cost me the same in phone calls it is just not on and one more thing they told me it was totally unlimited no caps or restrictions but it is unlimited with caps and restrictions. VERY POOR WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!     
5424|Fed up of energy companies putting up their prices and now dropping them as I'm never sure i'm on  a good deal. Checked out uSwitch and found I could save GBP231 pounds. Better in my pocket than theirs, site was easy to use and took me 15min, it helps if you have your annual bill from your energy company. I have used uSwitch before and the switch went without problems so happy to do it again, just hoping the prices dont go up again. 
5425|The only thing I can see is the up to 12 weeks needed to complete. I hope it doesn't really take that long.Having ended my time with E-on on an all-time low I wouldn't wish to give e-on any advantage!
5426|Wanted to change our energy supplier. Sent email by uSwitch and so decided to have a look at the web site. Found it very easy to use. Didn't use the supplier that saved us the most money, but decided to use Scottish Power because they most suited us and there was an offer of an GBP80 cash back.Would recommend uSwitch to family and friends.
5427|I've just clicked on a complete waste of time advert on Google for uSwitch . They claim to have cards with a GBP3000. This is what the advert says...Bad Credit - GBP3k Credit Cards Limit Available.Apply Today For An Instant Response ...I have Bad Credit, I'd like a card with a GBP3000 limit for Christmas, but Oh - they don't have any GBP3000 credit limits! They best they have is a granite card which may or may not give you GBP3000 after 4 months.This should be illegal - It's very misleading and some mugs no doubt fall for this!
5428|The call centre staff are excellent especially (name removed),who was so cheerful and helpful..she actually brightened up my day as I was stressed because I`d just moved into my property and there was boxes everywhere!!!I would defo reccommend them.
5429|I requested an energy supplier switch in July 2011 and have just heard that there has been a problem with details not being carried over by uSwitch - EDF couldn't contact me  - have now missed the boat to save energy costs for gas and electric - very unhappy indeed. 
5430|Having bought a new flat I realized that the previous owner had failed to organize a final reading and I was facing the possibility of paying for previous energy usage. (Name removed) worked with me initially on the chat line but then on a continuous 'phone call including connecting me to the present supplier to cancel the contract and then helped me arrange what seems like a fantastic deal ensuring I obtained the correct and full information so that I can move effortlessly to the preferred supplier. I have no reference values to compare but I trust that I have obtained the most beneficial energy supplier available.  ((Name removed) even stayed at work beyond his working day to ensure that my order was completed.I have only used this site once before years ago and, frankly, I can remember little of that experience; however, on this occasion I was particularly happy with the entire service I received.  I used the 'confused' site a little while ago and all they did was sell my details to an insurance salesman.
5431|I was shocked when my current energy provider wanted to increase my annual bill by 30% even though they estimated I wouldn't use any more than this year. I spoke to (name removed) who found me a better deal than I had found myself on your website. He saved me GBP647.08pa. Well done and thank you (name removed), such a pleasant young man, I am so happy I have posted this on my facebook wall so that all my friends can save too. But for the delay in calling me back, 1 week, you would have scored higher, maybe that's the employer's fault, I know they have restrictions on outbound calling, especially when you're busy. Maybe they can learn from this, excellence in customer service is the key to a thriving business. (Name removed) ticks all the right boxes. 
5432|switched energy supplier it did not take place ,so u switch set up another switch and said they would give me a case of wine by way of an apology,i later discover its a virgin wine voucher giving GBP60 off a GBP109 case plus GBP6.99 delivery some gift when you have to fork out nearly GBP60  no thanks!!
5433|I had a problem with the electricity supplier I had chosen to switch to, for some unknown reason Scottish power thought I did not have an economy 7 meter when I actually do have one. The web-chat assistant (name removed) was most helpful in suggesting solutions to my problem. He ran the comparison again for me, and then supplied me with a contact phone no for the new supplier OVO, who in turn were great to chat to.
5434|I have used uswitch before when changing to cheaper suppliers. But I contacted them via their 'chat' online message service to talk me through the options of choosing a supplier now I've moved house. They were quick, attentive and talked me through all the relevant details.I feel confident I have the best option suitable for me. And I thought the quick response and friendly helpful service was wonderful!  Makes a real difference to get a service that is so good, relevant and helpful.I definately recommend them!  And (name removed) in particular was very helpful.Cheers!
5435|Initially I was impressed with uswitch it was easy to switch until I contacted customer services which I wasnt impressed with. I thought I had gone to uswitch through moneysaving website which would then give me 12 bottles of wine for free. I had heard nothing mentioned about the wine so contacted customer services. I was monotonely told i didnt go through the moneysaving website so wasnt eligble thank you goodbye. Now any company worth its salt would have replied by saying sorry you have mistakenly come to us away from the moneysaving website but as a gesture of goodwill we will honour the 12 bottle deal. I am now in the process of stopping the switch im that annoyed. 
5436|I would firstly like to thank (name removed) for all his help. Very friendly pleasant guy to talk to.I would have given a 5 for my overall rating but I was expecting a call Thursday evening which I didnt recieve. he called me today and we went through everything which was quick and easy over the telephone with (name removed). I would recomend your service to a friend as I do prefer to talk to a real person rather than just do everything online.
5437|I found the uswitch site very helpful and easy to use.Inspite of this, I phoned uswitch and spoke to a gentleman called (name removed), who I found to be very polite, jovial, and above all very helpful indeed. (Name removed) guided me through everything, and actually made it a pleasurable experience to switch.He was great to deal with.A big thank you.Many thanksAlan CAwthorne
5438|I received a call from (name removed) this morning  who delivered what i hope will be a successful saving package when we change supplier. He maintained a professional and personal  approach throughout and was patient in ensuring the correct info was given for calculations. He was easy to talk to and ready to address satisfactorily the questions I asked.U switch is an invaluable quick site to use and I will share this with friends.Michael-Lincoln
5439|Seen a great deal on the website but sadly I was struggling with the information that it was looking for. I called in and got through to a great guy called (name removed) who could not do enough for me. I work in the customer service trade  for a large telecoms firm and the level of service was World Class.  Gave all the information i needed but dealt with me like a human. made his call backs when he said he would and just generally looked out for me as a customer. Brilliant work from him and the best bit was even though he couldn't look at something else I was looking to switch  he ensured he got someone in the right place to try and help me out!! Lookin your work my man!!! 
5440|I spoke to a chap named (name removed) at uSwitch about switching over as I had some doubts about what to do. He was extremely helpful, polite, curtious, patient and more than happy to give me all the information and guidacnce I needed. Also very reachable and happy to call me back whenever he was tied up. I recommend this service to others and think that (name removed) is a great example of top class customer service and am looking forward to our new supplier. Many thanks!!!
5441|When I called USWITCH they even found me a better deal in the long term and the representative was very knowledgeable and professional. I saved just under 300 pounds by switching electricity provider...well worth the 15 minutes it took the website to handle my enquiry overall. Only one part I found tricky...I have just moved and wouldn't know my average annual costs. It would have been helpful if there was a tab to indicate this status.Well done U-Switch!
5442|Spoke to (name removed), customer service representative.He was so helpful and talked through everything, explaining as he went along.In my 70's I am a little unsure on using the net and it was good to have actual contact.Thanks.
5443|Lovely service & extremely helpful representative. I switched from eon to scottish power and saved myself GBP50 a month.
5444|i think the voucher is a con and would not reccomend this to anyone i can be emailed at butchblackaces@live.co.uk As for swapping companies this has yet to be tested i have signed up an await the results 
5445|I received excellent customer service today helpful,friendly and professional.  I received good advice and would recommend your company to family and friends and will be contacting you again in the future when i need help thank you for great service
5446|The detailed saving actually turned out to be incorrect and with no warning on your comparison site. We are currently with E-On Track and Save 7 and whilst E-On were about to move us to their Energy Plan, upon query they would move us to Track and Save 11 but which is still more expensive that N Power by GBP90. However upon receipt of the papers from nPower, which are not as clear as  E-On's and nor is their website,and after much investigation and calculation, we established they had put us on a Go Fix 8 Economy 7 tariff which resulted in being GBP268 more than the standard Go Fix 8. They cannot do what E-On do which is just amalgamte the 2 readings, they have to install a new meter and that takes up to 40 days to do. Therefore this somewhats mitigates some of the initial saving and is a hassle. Also if we hadn't read the nPower papers in details we would not have known this and only through phoning them have determined that.
5447|I am writing to say that I have never had such good service from a company, that I have had today from yourselves.  If only it was such a pleasure to talk to other companies that I have to phone on a regular basis.(Name removed) was the young man that I spoke to, he was absolutely charming and professional and knew exactly what he was talking about.  The whole switch for me was done simply, easily and with no hassle whatsoever.He even managed to get me the wine that I wanted!  Thank you very much for great customer service. Perhaps you could give other companies tips on how to make customers happy!
5448|"Having been informed by ""gocompare.com"" that they had no info about my Scottish Power tariff and that I would have to phone around individual energy-suppliers myself, I contacted ""uswitch.com"" and was very impressed by the patient, professional, informative manner in which (name removed) explained and took me through the process.I shall certainly recommend uswitch and her, particularly, to people I know, who have discussed wishing to change suppliers."
5449|I recently spoke to (name removed) at Uswitch regarding changing my gas and electric.  I normally do everything online but wasn't able to as I wasn't sure of my current price plan.  (Name removed) was able to give me this information very quickly and then offered to take me through the rest of the process on the phone.At first I declined as I prefer to just get on with it but he said it would be very quick which it was and I also had a couple of questions throughout which I wouldn't have got the answers for online.I also ended up discussing different options with him, again something I wouldn't have been able to do online.Very good, quick and efficient service.
5450|I signed up via money-saving-expert.com and received a confirmation e-mail from Uswitch but then no further communication for some weeks. I then called Uswitch who told me to call the supplier directly (Eon). This I did and was told that no communication had been received from Uswitch and to call them again. This I did and was informed that there was no problem my account had been found and the suppliers would be chased up but it could take another couple of weeks before I could expect to hear from Eon. I asked for an e-mail to confirm that and was told I would receive one. But it did not arrive.A month later I went through exactly the same thing when I called Uswitch and told them I had still not heard anything. This time Eon told me to demand a reference or account number and not be fobbed off and then call them back. They were very helpful. I called Uswitch and told them what Eon had told me to do and the operator said they would investigate the situation with a senior member of staff and they would call me back.I was called back and asked me to explain what my enquiry was as she had been asked to give me a call. I explained the whole thing from the beginning. She said thet she would call me back. She did so and told me that because I had used my initial instead of my full name it was likely to be rejected by Eon. It was now too late to go on the better offers available at the time and that it would now cost me over GBP250 to go on a currently available offer. I asked one of the previous Uswitch staff had not picked this up or why someone had not contacted me either at the time or when it became apparent the arrangement had failed. She checked back through my account and found that the staff I had spoken to in the past had not recorded the details of my calls as they were supposed to have done although my calls had been logged. She believed that this was because staff were inexperienced temporary staff. I was shocked that something as fundamental as recording customer enquiries or checking application forms did not form part of the training of all staff.I asked if I could have some form of compensation as I had also cancelled my standing order with my current supplier and was now being charged at a higher rate because of the delay and this mistake had cost me not an inconsiderable financial sum and inconvenience. I was told that if I signed up there and then to a new tariff I would be given an extra free box of wine from virgin wines. This I did purely as the whole issue had worn me down to the point that I just needed it brought to a conclusion. Obviously the good service I had received in my previous dealings with Uswitch has been severely dented by my most recent experience and I would have to consider remaining a customer or recommending Uswitch in the future.I would welcome a response to this e-mail, however based on my experience I am not confident I shall receive one.
5451|Switching gas and electricity with U-switch guaranteed a free crate of 12 bottles of Virgin wines as long as you used the Money Saving Expert link.  I used the link and immediately the free wine offer details were shown so I proceeded with the switch.  When the confirmation of the switch came through I received a GBP60 voucher to use with Virgin wines by clicking another link.  I did this and was offered 3 different packs of wine each costing GBP109.99 which I could purchase for GBP49.99 by using my voucher.  This is not free wine. I was also committed to joining a wine club which sent me crates of wine every 3 months unless I cancelled.  This is not what I expected when I signed up.  I contacted U-switch and they said I hadn't used the right link.  I argued that I had and there must be something wrong with the system.  They wouldn't accept that but finally accepted that I was on the list for the free wine and I would get it in about 4 months when the switch was completed.  I feel that this clouded the whole business of switching and I do not feel confident that the wine will arrive.  I will not use U-switch again if this is the case.I switched to Scottish Power's Online Energy Saver 15 Dual Fuel
5452|Good web site, easy access. Their estimate of what my bills amounted to over last year based on consumption was pretty close. So hopefully, the estimated savings will also be close. (GBP122).
5453|I was so surprised at how easy this site makes the whole process. It was very quick and easy to see the savings to be had. Once the proceed button was pressed it all went very smoothly. let's hope the suppliers do as well.
5454|Changing suppliers can be a daunting prospect. How easy, cost-effective and beneficial it was then, to talk to (name removed) who guided me through the process. (Name removed) was knowledgable and extremely willing to suggest different options. Nothing was left to chance; I didn't just purchase the first possibility. What really made a difference was that (name removed) wanted to help - and I found this to be incredibly refreshing. Once we had settled on the new supplier, EDF  he was fantastic at clearly explaining next steps, what to do etc. Above all, he took his time; I never felt rushed into buying the first thing we discussed or as if I was asking stupid questions (I may well have done!)    One reassuring fact is that once you've switched, you're not on your own; (name removed) gave his email address and was at pains to point out that if there were any future issues (there may be) I could drop him a line. Nice touch.   Although I switched before with uSwitch, I was hugely impressed with the customer servic; namely (name removed). His attitude and approach is a huge asset to uSwitch. Thank you. 
5455|Accessed the website and entered the desired information but it failed to register. Tried several times over two days with always the same result. Phoned USwitch and spoke to a young lady named (name removed). She was fantastic. Spoke clearly, was very polite and helpful and processed my application quickly and efficiently. I am very, very happy with the outcome and intend to let my brother know about USwitch in the hope that he too will be able to benefit from the service.  Thank you.Just wish I'd known about USwitch sooner.
5456|(Name removed) who advised me was very thorough and checked carefully before advising me. He clearly knew his subject and was polite so that I did not feel pressurised. The discussion lasted some time (possibly why I had to wait before I got through) but nothing compared to the time and hassle of checking through the maze of tarifs and options myself. Things were clearly explained. I have yet to experience the recommended service but so far I am very satisfied with the service.
5457|sent confirmation e-mail on the 7 jul that the switch was going ahead.had a cold call from edf energy today and when i told them i was switching to them after using your website they knew nothing about it.fortunately the energy plan i chose was still available through them but it could easily have been withdrawn and no longer possible to have!!!
5458|Hi (name removed), I appreciate the help and guide you gave me today. You were very polite and understanding. I felt very relaxed when you went through the quotes with me and explained how I would save on my Electricity/Gas and with all the benefits i may receive. I was amazed how much (name removed) had saved me GBPGBPGBP by switching to Plan: Fixed S@ver 2 Dual Fuel.I was recommended by a friend to use USwitch. My friend was correct. Your customer service were excellent. I would recommend anybody to use USwitch to see how helpful you are. You made me smile! Thank you once again.Kind regards,Mr W Graham14/09/11
5459|How easy did uSwitch make it for me to change my gas and electricity suppliers. It took less than a minute and they've saved me five hundred pounds a year. Thats one hell of a pair of shoes.
5460|Compared prices today pending asking for a new price plan from my supplier. Within an hour (name removed) contacted me and went through reasons to reconsider my choice. It was clear that my supplier( SWALEC) had offered a deal that was ranked 86th out of 93 for competitiveness. (Name removed) convinced me that a deal from EDF ranked 3rd out of 93 would save me over GBP400 in twelve months.It is refreshing change to speak to someone like (name removed) whose clarity enthusiasm and cheerfulness came through so strong on the phone. 
5461|This is the first time I've switched provider for my gas and electricity using a comparison website and I must say how delighted I am with the results. I simply entered my postcode and some details of my fuel use over the year, and immediately received 6 comparison prices, with the cheapest at the top.  Switching over was child's play - one click of the mouse and it was done!  I have also had clear instructions as to how to proceed from now on, although it seems that everything will be done for me. Very pleased - so far!
5462|If you need a clear and concise energy supplier quote,then speak to (name removed) at uSwitch.His expertise and professional approach is second to none,and left us in no doubt as to which deal is the best on the current market,and gave us examples of available deals.We are now switching from British Gas to a better long term package.              Thank you(name removed), may you and your colleagues long continue to give a valuable service.I will certainly be recommending uSwitch to friends and family.
5463|MY MOTHER IS CURRENTLY WITH STAYWARM AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS BUT WHEN SHE GOT HER LATEST RENEWEL IN SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH IT HAD GONE UP FROM GBP97 TO GBP134 WHICH IS A BIG INCREASE FOR PENSIONER WE DID CONTACT STAYWARM TO SEE IF WE COULD SWITCH TOO A DIFFRENT OPTION THEN I CAME ACROSS USWITCH WEBSITE I FILLED IN MY DETAILS AND GAS / ELECTRIC READINGS AND EMAILED THEM THE I HAD A RETUN CALL THE NEXT DAY FROM (name removed) HOW HAD CHECKED OUT MY OPTIONS AND MANAGE TO SAVE ME SOME MONEY STAYING WITH THE CURRENT SUPPLIER AND CHARGING ME GBP107 WHICH IS BETTER THAN GBP135 I WAS QUOTED SO IF YOU GET IN TOUCH AND ASK FOR(name removed) 5 STARS ***** FOR CUSTOMER SERVICES AND EXPLAINING IT SO EASY 
5464|I wanted to get rid of British Gas who were basically bleeding me dry. I used U Switch and within about 2 minutes I had signed up with N Power for their Bill Saver Dual Fuel Online Energy Plan with a promised GBP100 credit after paying by direct debit for 12 months, fixed energy prices until 2013 and an estimated annual saving over over GBP350. Well it almost sounds too good to be true, so I will have to wait and see. I was on British Gas's Essential Tariff, which put in consumer terms means British Gas's Extortionate Tariff because they are a bunch of thieving custards and they don't care if the nation's elderly population freeze to death during yet another harsh winter as long as the fat cat boss gets his millions of pounds and all the hooray henry directors get big, fat bonuses. If there really is a hell, then that's where British Gas's head honchos are going, and I hear the heating is free down there. 
5465|(Name removed) was articulate and easy to understand. I had most of the information required before I phoned to switch my supplier so the conversation went very smoothly.I will happily reccommend USwitch to my family and friends.
5466|(Name removed) was enthusiastic and anxious to help and provide as much information as he could so I could make an educated decision about the best competitive dual fuel plan currently available.  At the outset I believed I had made an online application via Uswitch two weeks earlier but I called because I had heard no more from either my existing supplier or the new one. Since my prior application could not be traced, (name removed) facilitated a new application and supplied very useful guidance in doing so. I found the service level to be excellent and I am extremely grateful to (name removed) for all his help.  Well done! From David Harrison.
5467|(Name removed)  was brilliant and she knows her job it was a pleasure talking to her and she has nsorted out the PROBLEM. many thanks to her peter donne
5468|you have to spend a minimum of GBP119 to get the GBP60 voucher !!nothings (free)what a let down this is
5469|Site was quite easy to use but was confusing about which were fixed prices and just a fixed percentage under the the actual price and still able to rise. the follow up phone call was more helpfull. the gift certificate was pointless, not any good for people who cannot drink!!  
5470|Very good service and clear advice. Help me to understand what is the real benifit of switching engery supplier.The service is much clear than I spoke to my own supplier directly. Really recommend their service.
5471|The process couldn't have been simpler - in just a couple of minutes looks like I've saved over GBP300 p.a. on gas & electricity. I'd been putting off the attempt, due to previous poor experiences & hassle with on-line dealing, but uSwitch made it almost a pleasure.I shall be back to compare deals for my Motor & House contents insurance when the time comes.Also - the absence of irritating meerkats & Italian tenors on the TV adsis very much in uSwitch's favour.
5472|Entering the USwitch process, I reported duel-fuel standard-supply quarterly-on-demand payment status and, after prompts, requested dual-fuel variable-direct-debit quarterly payment status.  USwitch did not tell me what plans might have saved me money through other billing / payment options.  USwitch did not tell me what plans might have saved me money if I were to split gas purchases from electricity purchases, using two suppliers.Perhaps dual-fuel variable-direct-debit quarterly payment plans from single suppliers are the least expensive options.  If so, I don't know that.  Somewhere during the application process a note of this sort would be welcome:  
5473|Contacted to seek advice on a new energy product, (name removed) my advisor was pleasant and very knowledgeable and was happy to answere any questions, Oh and a free phone number too, which is always usefull!!
5474|really pleased with the advice and service i was given and have changed supplier thanks to(name removed) and his friendly manner.there has been no negative points
5475|Spoke to(name removed) at USwitch today regarding my energy supply. I reviewed my options with him and decided to switch from Scottish Power to EDF Energy. (Name removed) was very helpful, informative and great to talk to. He was confident, knew his subject and gave me all the information I needed to decide to switch.He confirmed that I would not be charged a cancellation fee and that the companies would agree a mutually acceptable meter based on my previous energy usage. Also that Scottish Power would refund any credit surpluses to me on completion of switch over. (Name removed)  is an great asset to USwitchJohn Callaghan, 28th July 2011    
5476|I spoke with (name removed) from U Switch, he was full of advice and friendly. I would definitely use U Switch again as they're taking over everything for me at no cost. Ended up saving GBP30 per month!
5477|switched one deal on line phoned up for the other mark was very helpful will use this site again and will recomend 
5478|Offer single fuel customers 6 bottles of free wine and as per the offer which duel fuel customers get ie, 12 bottles of free wine,  instead Single Fuel customers get GBP60 off 12 bottles of wine costing them another GBP60 + P&P.;  Other switching companies will offer GBP20 cashback to Single Fuel custumers and GBP40 to Duel Fuel Customers and so unless you'd be buying 12 bottles of wine anyway this is a bit of a disappointment.  Should have read the small print to the letter and then gone with Simplyswitch instead.
5479|uswitch.com  - helped me to find a good supplier with good rates for a fixed termThe advisor was good, knowledgable, polite and efficient in order to find the supplier and rates for my energy switch. Based on his recommandations and my common sense, average usuage, I have decided at the same time to chage my energy supplier. 
5480|I checked out lots of comarison web-sites, and kept coming back to yours. Easy to navigate, and gave the best results.Only just accepted package, but staff member efficient, friendly and professional.I would recommend without hesitation.
5481|Your call centre staff were friendly, patient when I didn't have bill details and efficient, beating the best offers I had been able to find. Switching was painless and took moments. I am seriously impressed with your service. You've potentially saved me GBP300 this year. Thank you.
5482|went to site for price comparison and was informed GBP108 saving pa if Switched to Scottish Power. All details input into system pressed the button agreeing to the transfer and then was advised actaul saving now only GBP84 and that was estimated. 2 emails querying / complaining to uswitch have not been answered.would not recommned this site to anyone as not transparent
5483|The person I spoke to asked me to contact my present supplier for certain information and called me back as he said he would.  He then asked me about why's and wherefores (background, etc.) and recommended what he believed was the best product for me. I was aware I was being sold a product, but it was done very well and the whole experience was pleasant.  He answered my needs, cut through my growing irritation with energy companies in general and provided me with a solution on a plate.  My experiences elsewhere have made me generally cynical, but I live in hope this will prove to be unfounded this time.
5484|I am finding the process of switching suppliers easy - uswitch really try to help!Their website made it really easy to make comparisons.
5485|It was easy to change electricity suppliers using USwitch as all the information I needed was there.  The staff at the call centre were very helpful and handled my switch over efficiently.
5486|I recently went onto uswitch in order to identify a dual fuel provider, as my tariff with my current provider finished at the end of june.I chose to change to scottish power. Irang uswitch toask about the payments that were in credit, aHe was very polite and knowledgablend during the conversation with (name removed), it was pointed out to me that I had signed up to a variable tariff, which could prove coatly as prices from the big providers were due to rise by upto possibly 15%.I gave (name removed) my annual consumption for both my gas and electricity, and he hten found me a good tariff with my original providerthat is fixed for three years.He was very polite and knowledgable about what to the man inthe street is a minefield of tariffs and charges that change after so many kwh of use. Big thanks and well done 
5487|I have just use the U Switch web site and ended up calling customer services. They were excellent and saved me around GBP500 on the plan that I currently have.I would recommend that everyone should at least go through the short exercise and see if they to can save money.Its easy, quick and well worth it with friendly knowledgeable staff. Thanks (name removed) and U Switch...
5488|I have just changed energy supplier and this was so easy.I even got to talk to a person that could help me all the way to finding my new energy supplier.This was so so easy, no fuss no mess.Thanks Jason great jobPlease keep up the great customer service. 
5489|The adviser was very helpful - in fact i thought i'd found the cheapest electricity deal at GBP451 but he found me a fixed term 3 year deal with edf for GBP343 so very happy with this
5490|I searched the uSwitch website and found conflicting information; this was probably due to me rather than the website. I found it a little ambiguous in places, so I chose to e-mailed them my energy bill. Within 48hrs I had a phone call and the good news is I should be able to save over GBPGBP130/year! I spoke with Shaheeda Khan who knew her stuff so well that I had to ask her to slow down as she was so bubbly and enthusiastic! I have used uSwith in the past and would definately use it again. 
5491|Kelly was faultless as an advisor. Having done a basic search online i was actually offered an even cheaper fixed term deal.Having been with Scottish Power for numerous years I felt it time to stop accepting price increases and review. The new supplier sites make getting hold of consumption details easier and then with the help of Kelly I found a 3 year fixed term deal based on monthly payments without having to decypher different companies charge plans which can be confusing. The monthly charge with EDF is already GBP12/month cheaper, before considering the impact of SP's intended increase. What a great change to talk with people who are trying to SAVE you money rather than push deals at you.Highly recommended to anyone with 15mins to spare and who is sick of being robbed.
5492|After doing some comparison online, I called uSwitch. The rep was very helpful and called me back a couple of times as I had to liase with my partner to make decisions. It was very useful to be able to see the details on the website and to ask questions, and the rep was very accomodating.The rep was able to give advice, which bolstered the information I was able to find online.Overall very good.
5493|Dermot Conway was very helpful and gave me a call back to get me a better dual fuel deal,he was very clear in going through the deal and took time to answer any questions I had.
5494|Rep Dermot Conway called me back when i ducked out of website half way through as i didn't have all the necessary info.Took some info from me which i had now prepared and was able to give me a better deal.Pleasant to talk to and concluded all necessary issues over the phone.  Much easier than the net in a way.Deal done. Well done U Switch
5495|Having switched from Southern Electric to Scottish Power in March I have just switched again to EDF Energy to avoid the price hike. I now have a direct debit that is GBP20 per month cheaper on a plan that is fixed until September 2012. U Switch rang me on my mobile and were very helpful. I would recommend their service to friends. Saving GBP240 took about 3 minutes of my time. Worthwhile I thought.
5496|Very easy website to use gave clear and concise information about all options (energy tarrifs).extremly pleasant and efficient customer services.
5497|Like the previous reviewer since using Uswitch my ex-directory number has been inundated with marketing calls from Utility Warehouse and no matter how many times I tell them I am locked into a contract they still keep calling. The caller is a foreign gentleman so it may be that he doesn't understand me. I can't find any way of stopping the calls as their number is shown as unavailable.
5498|The uSwitch site recommended EDF Energy for my gas & electricity based on price.  The very same day, the calls from EDF to my landline kicked off (presumably marketing calls), several per day. I use a call screening system and so have not been too inconvenienced.  Could be a coincidence, but I feel this is unlikely, and for this reason I shall not be using uSwitch again.
5499|I wanted to change my phone and used uswitch to look at available offers. Found a great offer on mobiles.com and signed up for it. Only to find that the internet package advertised by USwitch doesn't actually exist. Mobiles.com offered to cancel contract for me so have acted fairly to make up for the mis-information given on Uswitch website. BEWARE what you see isn't always what is on offer!! I shan't use this site again!!!
5500|i by phone am with edf gas my bill is 350pounds from 10 nove till 10 feb
5501|I have always used uswitch to switch my energy and car insurance, but i have now discovered other sites that list a lot more suppliers.  It's a good site but there are too many distractions.  It has too much information 
5502|Have always used uSwitch to change energy and car insurance but have come across other sites that are easy to use and list more suppliers that you can switch to online. Two new Sites to look out for are WhichSwitch and the new look Switchit4u.co.uk site which is 100% better than before. Come on uSwitch pull your finger out or you might get left behind!
5503|Well after changing my mind about switching phone company's through uswitch which i did on the 22/3/08  I tried to cancel this the next day , I sent email after email with no reply, today 25/3/08 I spent a hour on the phone on hold and when I got through this is what they said: I'm sorry sir but I'm not the person who deals with this  ,this person sits near me and if you give me your details and number they will ring you back, but i said this needs dealing with now will they ring me soon ,i cant promise that they will phone you immediately sir, so i waited and waited and waited and nothing so i phoned them again at 2pm today its now 3.30pm and im still on hold , i contacted the company who i was going to change to and they haven't received the order yet and say that i should cancel with uswitch as i will incur cost if i cancel with them when it goes through. Finally they answer as I type this, I asked if it was canceled they say its in the cancellation Q i asked if i would receive an email to confirm this and was told no i will not if any thing goes wrong with this process. They will be in touch matter . Customer service at Uswitch is poor, very poor.
5504|I would LOVE to secure a good deal online vis a vis reducing the levies made on me by service providers eg. gas, electricity etc.  I attempted to register with uSwitch, but it rejected my application on the grounds that I did not provide details of a UK land line.  I explained that I had both a satellite telephone and several cell telephones, but they remained adamant that such did not meet their criteria. They needed a conventional UK std code, otherwise they were unwilling to accept me. After being totally computer and technology illiterate only a few years ago (I still struggle with VCR's) I am quite proud (at a relatively old age) of dragging myself into this century, but I am now frustrated by seemingly having overtaken this company's, and several other companies technology.  Had I now better get out my pipe and slippers and sit still  for a few years until the 'whizz kids' catch up?
5505|I ve been with them for years but the last month or so when I top up online it dose not credit my meter for days meaning it gos on to emergency costing me a for true this week my top up has not gone on at all can't seem to be able to contact them it just rings out and I am half way into emergency already. I am fuming so I am currently waiting for the new supplier to contact me and get out of that terrible utilita disgusting service 
5506|I received a phone call from someone from utilita at start of february and even tho i wanted nothing to do with them i asked him to send me some info anyway.So 2 weeks later in the middle of february a letter came through to me which i looked at but didnt do anything about it.I then get a text message saying that i had agreed to use them and that my gas and electic supply would transfer to them from scottish power on march 16th.I contacted them and they said i had agreed over the phone which i denied and they then said they would need to listen to the conversation.I am still waiting for them to tell me but in the meantime they have switched us to them without me agreeing or signing anything.I am not happy about their conduct and in the process of getting back to scottish power and if i am able to complain to someone regarding this then i will.Shocking behaviour.
5507|I'm currently on hold waiting to talk to someone about the fact that my gas hasn't automatically topped up,and I have been cut off supply !! I've been on hold over 30 minutes ! I've got a poorly 9 month old baby covered in vomit who needs a bath, and I've got to try and fill it up from the kettle !! Every time I top up my gas I have to manually put the numbers in myself !! That's fine you say...... But on this occasion no code has been sent to my mobile so I can't input them ! I now top up over GBP20 a week on gas, double what I ever did with eon or british gas ! So I'm now paying GBP500 a year more to be ripped off and constantly without gas when I try to top up. How this company is still going I do not know !! I'm going to be getting in touch with British gas to see if they can come and put me on direct debit as I've had enough of this company. Almost 45 minutes on hold and this is on the so called 'emergency line' so looks like i will have to top up even more, so when thr code appears on screen i can write it doen and go outside to input manually !! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!
5508|This energy company is the worst interms of cost. very very very expensive I just couldn't believe how much I was paying. its disgusting how they pull u into it claiming its cheaper....believe me its not . I have decided to leave them despite the charge tht will need to pay them for cancelling before 12mnths as agreed on the contract. I waiting for new supplier I just cnt wait to end with them.....there meters r smart for sure.easy top up ...but price is worst..
5509|This is the worst energy company ever Salesman rip you off on the door telling you liesvery very expensive and then you can never get through on the phones to complainTotal waste of time and money There a joke !!!!!
5510|Ive been with this company utilita who provide my gas and electricity for around two years .I have had nothing but hassle since the smart cards were introduced. Its got to a point that every week i top up my gas card i have to make a very expensive phone call to them to sort out the meter IE not topping up or needing even more money befor it turns back on the list of problems are endless. even this afternoon ive come home after topping up my gas card to more than what i owe emergency credit as such the amount i paid on my card would cover what i owe and also leave some extra on my balance but yet againe the digitel box is now telling me ive got to go out and put more money on my card!!!! this happens almost every week ive asked for help with my phone bill as you are put on hold constentley if you phone them they refused.its safe to say that i have gone with another company as from now on. advise anybody who are thinking of going with utilita not to bother .
5511|My gas and electric costing an absolute fortune with them, friends with other companies pay much less than I seem to be, I'm scared to use my gas because it uses approx GBP1.50 every hour. The electric isn't as bad but still costs loads.The customer services are some of the worst I have come across. It took 10 mins of automated button pressing to speak to someone, who then hung up on me. Then I emailed them on the 3rd January about a replacement smart meter as mine is broken and it took 1 MONTH for them to reply and that was after another 6 emails sent. Then they said the meter was being sent on the 5th Feb, it's still not here on the 14th February when it should arrive within 5 days but they're taking 25% of anything I top up on the electric so I'm paying for something I haven't even got. I've sent another 3 emails since then about it and still NO REPLY again!!!I tried to leave them last year after being with them well over 1 year and I got a letter off the company I was going to join saying Utilita refused to let me go and no reasons why. I only joined because my housing association  say they're the cheapest around and silly me believed them, I wouldn't be surprised if they get paid off Utilita for saying that as they quite clearly aren't!STEER CLEAR of them because they're useless!!!
5512|I signed up to utilita In March2014 a man came doing door 2 door made out you didn't have to pay standing charges for the meters what a load of rubbish he was spouting.when u try phone them it takes forever for them to answer.iv never spent so much money in my meters since I went with utilita .I'm so glad I'm changing back to my old company e-on.utilita are absolutely rip-off merchants.
5513|"The worst thing I ever did was to sign up to Utilita, they put their prices up after being with them for 2 months, the automatic top ups and text top ups have never worked for us, but the worst thing is the so called ""Freedom unit"". We where promised a state of the art machine that could save us energy, instead we got a prehistoric box with an alarm that never stops going off, it goes off at 8 o'clock in the morning and will not stop until we get out of bed and stop it, and in 5 minutes time it will usually go off again. It is not a freedom unit it is a slave unit and I can't wait until our contract is up so that we can be emancipated from it."
5514|Signed up to utilla. Cause they said they were cheapest around. How wrong my electric has doubled and my gas as gone from 70 pound a month with eon to 140 a month with utilla  Stay away from them.Worst company ever.
5515|i moved into a new home provided by utilita with smart meters.  Electric is fine but the gas does not update any credits and i have to wait get this 8 weeks for an engineer to come out and fix the communications box or the meter. I have been told if the gas stops working they can then class this as an emergency appointment and i have to stay of  work.  Why cant they fix the problem now.  They also mixed my acount up wih previous tenant who owed money and when i top up it takes debt of my credi and i have to call them eveytime to sort this out.  It has cost me over GBP40 in calls so far ive only been with them for 4.5 weeks and they booked appointment incorrectly i took time of work and no one turned up  .  account going to ofgem on 10th of feb 2015  . ive asked to speak to a manager 5 times now and for someone to take ownership and ive used the online form 3 times to complain and just found out they are not recieving the information so sent email.  I want compensation for missed appointment stress and time ive taken to call them  and cost of  phone calls
5516|do not switch to this company I have and they are stealing money from me I put in the emergency for the electricity which is GBP7 on the day of the smart meter install I must of used about GBP1 and now they are charging me for the full GBP7, 95% of which I did not use they will rip you off every chance they got and they are doing the same with the gas i'm not sure about the figures for the gas but they are stealing from me on the gas to, do not use this company
5517|My Mother who is 86 switched to Utilita Energy a few months ago. They installed a smart meter that is located where there is no radio signal. They have since fitted a larger aerial, still no radio signal. So she as to put the numbers in manually and then force the meter to update, easy you think! Well the time before last the code contained 60 numbers. Utilita Energy are Total rubbish!!! Yes they are very polite on the phone but no help. So you are faced with what is an unreasonable task to perform, or freeze.  
5518|spoke to an advisor samir gor he was something else got my gas back on in seconds & was in no rush and asked if i'd needed help with anything else!! The fact that the gentleman had a 5star* voice wished me a lovely day had definitely done the trick, advise anyone to ask for him when calling utilita customer service love u Utilita - Katie XXX
5519|"I had the misfortune of moving into a home supplied by Utilita. The very first time I had to use their ""smart pre-paid card system"", the systems breaks down. Gas isn't working, which results in no heat, no hot food, etc.... Did I mention that happened on the evening of Dec 31st. I've been calling their emergency lines for almost 24 hrs now. Each time I'm met with the same automated nonsense and the eventual disconnection. No humans to be found as I sit in a cold, cold, and very cold home. I've already signed up with Ovo, they had some decent reviews, and their customer service is highly rated as far as I can see. I don't care if I have to pay more, as long as I have someone on the other side working with me. "
5520|Awful awful awful company. The little box is ridiculously complicated to use. If you run out of gas, best believe you'll be spending the rest of your night figuring out how to get it back on, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I feel so, so sorry for any elderly people having to use this system. Why on earth our landlord has chosen this is beyond me. An absolute joke!!
5521|Told they where from the council organising my new metersNot mentioned anything about I was switch energy supplier or how much I would be payingEnds up I have switched and its more expensive than my last supplier . Now they want me to pay cancelation chargeThese people should be stopped from signing people up 
5522|DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LET THESE SUPPLY YOUR ENERGY !!!! We recently purchased a property and had utilita install smart meters for both gas and electricity. The electricity worked fine but the gas meter was faulted and they would not accept this. They even had the nerve to as ME to pay for an engineer from a private company to check the meter and send them a copy of the report, (which I would have paid for !), I told them where to stick their meters and went back to British Gas.
5523|I have been with a lot of suppliers over the years, Most of them are completely unhelpful and expensive, My gas meter was chargimg me 30p daily even though credit was at 0 pence, I phoned the company I was with and they failed to help me, If I put GBP5 on the meter it was giving me GBP2 credit, Freezing winters n one cares, Got Utilita smart meters installed new gas and elec meters, As I live upstairs always know how much I have in credit, Gas is now on and no stnding charge, Also got GBP12 government energy scheme for nothing, Dont believe the rubbish people are saying about high pricrs etc it is cods wallop, On average I use GBP10 week fo elec GBP5 gas, My sister gets huge bills from npower,.Ok if your on a keymeter get Utilita you cn top up online and by phone, power never goes off at weekend or after 4 pm, 10 emergency too, FANTASTIC get Utilita you wont be dissapointed.
5524|Fuming just got it in yesterday at 12 and 5GBP been used already didn't even beep to let me know there was only 1GBP left don't know how to put emergency on I can't afford this I have a baby to pay for i use to use 5GBP every 4 days but now every 2 -.-' 
5525|This company does not belong to the warm home discount scheme so pensioners on pension credit receive NO DISCOUNTS. ALL PENSIONERS STEER CLear.
5526|this company is brilliant. their rates are cheap and they have great customer service. i cant say anything bad about them they truely are a fantastic company to be with.
5527|Paying upto 58 to 60 or more a month with this scabby  company upto blady discusting. Old company upto 45 nice
5528|"I was called on Aug 8th by a company affiliated to Uswitch telling me I could save money. By 10th August Utilita called me themselves to say stuff was being put in the post and I would have 2 weeks to decide.I recieved a letter on 5th September dated 28th August on saying welcome to Utilita. Nothing else. Went on website to read a number of dissatisfied customers so I called them about cancelling.They refused unless I paid a GBP52 cancellation fee saying the 2 week cancellation time has passed (apparently a verbal contract over a phone is legal said the advisor).So anyway I told them that I had taken 5 days upon written confirmation to decide to cancel but they weren't having any of it. Despite me claiming I didn't have enough time to cancel and they hadn't provided me enough details to get a fair idea of the company.I recieved another letter yesterday (15 Sep) dated 27th August (yeah you work that one out) saying I had 14 days to cancel which of course I can't now.I found the customer services on the point of rude and most unhelpful.From what I can now see on the literature I would have been cheaper staying with my old electric provider.Utilita have ""legally"" taken my business but nothing much more than that.In my opinion I find them unethical and money grabbing.Do not switch to them!"
5529|Been with them for several months now and never had any problems. It's great that we don't have to mess about going to the shop to top up as we can do it online.In terms of price - we haven't really noticed any difference but to be fair, I only really wanted Utilita for the Smart meters and the ability to top up without leaving the house.It would be great if they made a smart phone app to top up.
5530|Far too expensive total rip offs dont consider using them im using twice as much as i was with my previous supplier
5531|Signed up with utilita expecting cheaper rates and better service but I got the exact opposite. Engineer comes round and tells me that I'm on a shared fuse so he is unable to install my smart meters. Find out my neighbours are at work from 8am-6pm so I let utilita know and they say they can't fit it unless they have time off or till they have time off, I say what if it's months before they have time off an they say then you'll have to wait then. I then want to cancel with them and they said I'll have to pay a fee to leave them! They are the worst and I should of stayed with my previous suppliers! I wouldn't recommend them to anyone just advise people to stay clear, very clear!
5532|After sighning up I got home on the thursday sent cancellation on friday they said they never recieved it no mater what I did  they bully u to stay I got in contact with offgem and obusman and we at deadlock at minute just a warning read terms and conditions and to be honest don't even try and sighn up had nothing but hell and still going through  it
5533|We were previously with EDF Energy and my partner switched to these without my permission. I was not happy but after a few months I have noticed that both our gas and electricity are cheaper.We weren't told about the cancellation fees which I think is a little sneaky and they are seriously over priced but we have no intentions of leaving yet anyway.They also keep sending letters about Smart Meters but we aren't sure if we want those or not.
5534|"I had a man from them claiming hes checking all the council meters in my area and showed me that im paying a weekly charge for my meter with British gas..he went on for about half and hour about how this company were much cheaper and didn't charge weekly standing charge etc ..and that it was ""a no brainer "" not to sign up and then i realized he was just a salesman i told him i was happy with my current one and he kept saying he was much cheaper ..i said i needed time to think etc and he said its only today etc so i agreed to sign up but as soon as he left i checked online and on there site i saw there unit price is so much more so cancelled ..guess despite what people turn up on your door saying don't believe them..i got rest of my flats to cancel too as he told them all the same story...to sum up if you wanna change look yourself as especially this company all the free meters and free credit are not free once you start using them..and if you cancel make sure you send letter and ring them within the 14 days"
5535|A gentlemen came to my door step today smartly dressed,utilitia ID guess what he had all the details of council tenants who are on pay-as-you Go and the funny thing he said they are contracted by council that's why he has all the details of tenants along the line, l asked various questions and the body language changed and l said l am not signing anything until l read yo terms and conditions he became angry and l said BYE BYE.
5536|I've been with this supplier for about 2 years now, had a little issue with old meters. Now the new ones have been fitted for gas and electric, there great. They supply a wireless digital hand held gadget that gives you all the info you need to know, regarding what tarif you on, and how much you've used each day, so your on track when you need to top up.when putting credit on to my account, it's applied a lot faster now, not like when I had to wait about an hour! Really happy with the service they give too, very helpful staff.
5537|putting more money on my gas will not be back to them any more 
5538|Originally signed up, then read all these reviews.  Cancelled it within the 14 day cooling off period, then followed up with an email after receiving a letter.  Well received an letter from my current supplier, saying sorry you are leaving us.  Rang them and they say they can't cancel it as it has already gone through.  Rang Utilita (yes did get an answer, and he did ring back) but they know nothing about any cancellation.  Now complaint made to the ombudsman, as this shouldn't be allowed to happen, in fact it is disgraceful.  DO NOT GO WITH THEM.
5539|horrible awful company. Steer well clear. Rip off prices, dont charge a daily standing charge but make up for this with stupidly high unit rates. GBP52 per meter to cancel. appauling!!! 
5540|I have been with Utilita and had no problems only sometimes having to input code manually. always been polite and professional to deal with.The old meters were good but I know they have newer meters now mine never cut me off at all. I had to respond with my own honest review. now joined rejoined Utilita and everything went fine but for some reason my gas meter is still showing a stranded charge of 0.2600 spoke to them and been offered new install date Electric meter no charges I would Recommend them to any one and my relations have them no issues
5541|Smart freedom meter , which not only looks cheap and nasty , guess what it doesn't work alarm constantly going off, in fact it's going off right now and there is money on. You can't swap suppliers back without a lot of hassle . In fact I'm on the verge of just roughing it and turning the lot off and buying a generator and bottled gas. It's got to be cheaper GBP10 a day nothing on and no one in all day ??????? rIp off 
5542|This 'company' is vile. I bet they get numerous amount of phone calls a day with people shouting down the phone asking why thier elec or gas is off even though they state they will not be cut off.Only a select few that work for the customer service department try and bother to help. most of them are rude and vulgar individuals.You get told one thing by one member of staff and something different by another.Training doesnt obviously come into the equation within the company as they dont even know what they are going on about half the time. They say your going to get a call back from a manager and then, when you do recieve a call 2 weeks after you've requested it, its always just another customer service advisor or a team leader who just says 'i am managing your account today'. if you do get one of 'them' who do say they are managing the account, its definetly NOT a manager.This company is definetly going to go bust within the next year, i mean, it has already gone bust once!I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS COMPANY EVEN IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.It's over priced and full of deluded people!!Even my friend who worked for them says even working for the company is a joke aswell!
5543|Worst company there I have put more that 200 on gas in a month biggest ripoff company out there
5544|The only good point about this company is that they provide electricity. Although the company makes a song and dance about not cutting off the electricity or gas at certain hours of the day, this USP compared to the overall service of Utilita is appauling.I spend at least GBP5 a day on electricity,I generally do not use a vast amount of electricity in one day but since I have switched to Utilita as my electricity supplier something as small as taking a shower costs around GBP2. After realising the amount of money it was costing for the little electricity usage, I called the customer service number and after waiting 20 minutes was eventually told that I could not switch back to any other electricity supplier as I was bound by contract to Utilita and a fee of GBP52 was needed in order for me leave the company. Utilita are a new company supplying electricity and it is because of this that they provide a service that is lacking compared to leading suppliers. The company just shows that new things in this case Utilita are not necessarily better than old.
5545|as an ex employee of the company it is the worst company I ever worked for.  Staff training is limited.  Very high turn over of staff.  If you decide to use them do not ever agree to DD payments.  You will never have any money as they help themselves to your money  I used to pass the calls to accounts as I was a CSA and never understood.  If a customer was in credit on the account they would still take additional payments.Customers were so angry and lost trust in the company..   We always had angry customers call in about why they could never get through and when they did no one knew what they were doing.  Staff morale was so low due to having to have permission to get out of their chairs or to put their hand up if they needed a drink.  
5546|I was in a GBP5.98 debt on my not so smart meter, being on a very tight budget at the moment, i topped up GBP7. The credit didn't automatically go on to the meter so i manually added it. Instead of being GBP1.02 in credit, i was now in GBP4 debt. GBP1.20 to my name, no electric and a baby in need of food i headed for the phone box. Spoke to useless customer services, explained the situation, i asked if there was a service charge or something i have to pay that doesn't show on my meter, with no answers or help until my credit ran out. Luckily a friend called round and borrowed me the money to clear this GBP4 that appeared on my meter for nothing.
5547|this has got to be the worst thing ive ever done.we got tricked into getting this disgusting servive,just been on the phone and guess what,not one bit of use that was.do not go with them,it will be the worst thing you ever do.id rather freeze than go with these horrible people.
5548|When someone came to my door  asking me to change to utilita I thought what a great idea made it sound cheaper than I was already paying and best of all you can top up online ,, knowing exactly how much your topping up as they send you an email.Biggest mistake EVER !!! I'm paying GBP30/GBP40 a week electric and the same with the gas that's more than double than I was paying with my old company I feel like I'm constantly topping up and sometimes having to live on the emergency as I'm a single parent with 3 small children which is even a bigger mistake as you end up paying double back  Do NOT change to this company complete rip off !!!!!When speaking to the company they tell me to top up more often  I refuse to pay any more than I'm paying  !!! I'm changing over to my old company ASAP !!!!!
5549|Absolute disgrace I couldn't moan when I first got it in and when women came to my door it she had great service but now I'm topping up ridiculously amounts of money and it's everyday I have 3 young children and I have a lot more other important bills I am topping up GBP5 per day on each if not more and when I do top up it takes ages to go on and with me not having a landline I either to go to a local phonebox which takes quite a lot of credit or my mobile when I'm on the phone the service isn't very good they put me on hold every 2 minutes I'm always speaking to someone different and they have the cheek to say I need to top up more credit, and apparently I can't change until my contract is other which probably in a year and with the cold weather it makes me more angry!!!!! 
5550|One of Utilita's sales agent's came to my door and at first i was a bit nervous, however after speaking to their customer services team i felt completely at ease. They picked up after about 30 seconds and were very polite and helpful with answering my questions. I am now 4 months down the line in having my Smart Meters and i could not possibly go back. 
5551|"Had to lovely polite men at my door explaining EVERYONE is getting these smart meters, in the area as it's classed as ""low income"" area, they spoke about it like it was mandatory NOT a choice! Signed up like a FOOL and really regretting it, there is only me and two children under 5 and I use to spend 40 a month on electric and 30 on gas and now it is constantly going! I feel like I am constantly put on gas and electric! Don't understand why! Also the loud and terrible annoying alarm to tell you gas or electric low goes off at ANYTIME of night, my last supplier the alam wouldn't bleep after 9.pm. A few nights ago at 2AM it went off causing my baby's to wake up scared! Had to go down half asleep with both of them as they were to scared to be left, to turn off it's not just a key in and out, you have to put the light on so you can mess about the the stupid keypad and turn the alarm off, and what makes it worse Is the alam goes off to tell u it's low and once your back in bed a few hours later the alarm goes off AGAIN to tell you it has gone and your in the emergency. I hope what iv read on here about not being able to change for 12 months is wrong because iv had enough, please don't change to there lying pirates! "
5552|Wife bought a house to let for her pension & previous owner had supply from UtilitaWell when we got the house I took both gas and electric readings they were Britis Gas and Southern Electric MetersUtilita said they were unaware of any change of ownership After reading reviews decided we would not use any energy till we had price for supply up till change over of supplierUtilita kept telling me they would send details regarding supply they also advised I could not change supplierAfter 3 weeks I got an email of terms but not for rate for an non agreed contractI advised Utilita I would be changing supplier & they said we will apply to the court to fit smart meters as you can not change supplierThey offered to put me through to accounts if I wished to terminate my account and find out charges to terminate Then I had to explain again I never have had an account to terminateI never wish to deal with this companyThe Gov and media say how easy it is to change supplier but all change sites reject applications saying information not correctI think it may take month's to resolve & this is hampering refurbishmentAs we will not turn on energy till prices / supplier resolvedAlso no wish to land a tenant with this company
5553|It's been a couple of months since my Mum singed up to Utilita when someone came to the door.It took ages before we received any contact from them.We received the keys for the current meters through the post the other week and started using them. They were suppose to come out this afternoon to fit the smart meters, but guess what NO ONE has turned up!We can't even get through to customer services as the phone just rings and no one picks up!Reading some of the newer comments/ reviews online and on Facebook has made me think that it was a bad choice going with them.What's worse, is on the letter it states they will charge GBP91 if we miss the appointment. Might see if we can make them pay us that charge as THEY missed the appointment.
5554|My Wife invested in a house to let as her pension and when we took over I read and photographed the metersI contacted Utilita to find out what deal they offered Utilita advised they would send me detailsWhen I got no information I advised utilita I was the new owner and gave them meter readings as they claimed outgoing owner had not advised detailsI explained I had no intention of using Utilita and would use another supplier as they were finding it hard to quote me pricesUtillita advised I could not change suppliers as I had their smart metersI explained I had standard billing meters marked Property of Southern Electric & British GasSo Utillita wish to change to smart meters even though I do not wish to use them Utillita have told me they will go to court to gain access to fit smart metersOur Solicitor advises not to use energy till problems resolvedI can not even find out proposed energy rate till my chosen supplier takes overHelp sites are no help as they reject application saying incorrect informationWhy do the Media and Gov say it is easy to change supplier when I have been trying for a month and I am advised it will take at least another 6 weeks & that is if Utillita co operateWe are trying to renovate without energy plus can not get landlords gas check/certificate without energyAs we would like a happy tenant we wish to resolve prior to lettingI presume previous owner signed up to this shambles just prior to letting & I doubt they will get a refund on their pre paid energyThey are to customer service what Atilla the Hun was to knitting
5555|what can I say about this company right here goes. I have served in british army and also have a disability in my legs now what happened was I moved into a bungalow and there was a debt of 78 pound on it they asked me to send proof so I did which is fair, I asked whether they could help me via stopping the debt and issuing a new card I was told this. Sorry but u will have to wait for the gas card to get sent out which will take 2-3 days also I cant have gas emergency as I have my electric on if u ask me this company is a joke. I am going through the papers and also my solicitor too as I feel this company is ran by stupid fake false and rude people
5556|I live in Kent had a lovely Northern chap talk me through the savings and convenience of the smart metres three months ago - spot on would definitely recommend to family and friends.
5557|2nd smart meter broken. Come home at 8pm to discover there's no gas. Refuse to send out an engineer until tomorrow. Freezing outside and no heating. 2 babies to keep warm. Shame you can't rate them one star. So the one star i have had to give them is a gold star for being the shi*est company ever!
5558|I had a sales person come to my door giving me all the sales patter and telling me that I would only pay for what I use as other company's charge,I asked for a book on all the stuff he was saying as I had heard nothing but bad things about them as my next door nabour has them and left them with out gas for two days in the winter and she has 3 young children and was told she was not a priority he Told me he couldn't give me any as other customers who he sees need it,its great to think these people come to your door to sell you some thing and when you ask for info on paper so you can check they refuse seems a bit funny to me.
5559|Stay away meters never work right been left with no gas on two occasions about to go of supply as what ever I top up never goes on the meters then have to wait upto for hours to get put back on there only solution is to leave as they don't want my custom or be a credit customer . One I can't leave as I can't afford to the charge for new meters to be installed his high GBP75 for gas GBP65 for electric as no other company can support utilitas meters and Two I signed up to be pre payment if I want credit meters I could get it cheaper elsewhere pluss I'm pre payment to avoid getting into debt. So the out come is do as they say of face being with out power slimey money grabbing heartless company and to think I'm pretty strong at fighting my case I could not imagine if someone elderly had a problem how much they would get ripped off 
5560|I have been a customer of Utilita for 4 years on pre-paid meters Ive only had 2 problems when the meter didn't communicate with the main 1s but once phoned they had someone out and sorted within 2 hours even at weekends, bank holidays. I am moving and having the same system fitted once ive moved. Have spoke to a fantastic lad called Joey who could not of helped anymore. I have had supplies from other companies and never had such good suppliers. I know its best to stay in credit than use the emergency as that's when you start owing. And ive not had a bill as always stayed in credit. I have read other reviews and cant believe what they are saying as have experienced what they are saying with other companys like Npower British Gas. But None with Utilita. Continuity speaks for itself and I wont be swopping to any other supplier. 
5561|I used to pay GBP10. A month with Npower. Changed and it is costing me GBP45. Month. I was told the wrong prices and have gone onto the highest tarrif. I am now owing GBP105. As I did not realise what they had done. They miss sell there products. Do not use.  Do not use. Do not use. Very expensive. 
5562|DON'T CHANGE SUPPLIER. THESE ARE USELESS. LEFT ME WITH NO GAS AND FIVE KIDS FOR TWO DATS. TOTAL JOKE. 
5563|Thankfully I had to escape the set up finalisation as we had to do the school run but glad I did as I managed to sit down and have a look through the brochure given to me and read these reviews.  The sales rep who visited our area told me that Utilia were replacing the prepayment meters in our area and using the new smart meter system replacing existing provider which I thought was quite good given the options available and no longer had to look at comparison of prices from providers - what he failed to tell me at the time though was that this was not compulsory at all and was just a service their company provided.  I also wasn't told until reading brochure that agreeing to the contract locked us into 12m contract with them.  Concerning to myself that I could have been a vulnerable customer who perhaps doesn't have access to internet to do search reviews or ability of understanding what was explained in the leaflet and allowed this to happen knowing no different. I am now looking at who I can put a complaint into in terms of trading standards etc as it was very, very misleading and am also forwarding complaint onto the company.    They may or may not be good value for money but will never transfer to this company based on this initial visit - makes you wonder what other rubbish will be spouted to you. 
5564|Gt meters never go of at night or weekend gt more credit and i can top up with me phone introduced 6 members of me family and we would introduce this company to more 
5565|Change to utilita atfer door to door sales man came, said it was cheaper and had no metre charge, i have spent a fortune i top up 4 times a week and on more than 6 occasions the freedom box as read rv busy then i lose all previous credit and top up on both gas and electric, utilia says this is a communcation problam with my metres and freedom box but will not come and fix it or refund my money, i told them i would be changing suppier and they have refused to release my account with them so i am stuck with a faulty system that is costing me a fortune.
5566|I had two sales men knocking at my door which is apparently eligle to do now ........ they told me they were cheap , I only paid what I used , they wouid install there own pay as you go metres which im still waiting for , I wouid not get a charge each day , I wouid get GBP5  pound on each of my metres its all rubish not one of these things are true im topping up 3 times a week , still getting a charge each day and still no metres I would not recommend this company to any body they are miss leading and full of .........
5567|I have been with Utilita for well over a year already, I never fussed about getting the smart meters installed because i just wasn't bothered. Until one day i lost my gas card and was completly out of gas. I phoned them up and the person i spoke to said i basically had two options, wait for a new card in the post, which could take two days to arrive as it was after 2pm (which i obviously didnt want to do, it was snowing at the time and i have a young child) or they could have somebody out with in four hours to fit smart meters and give me a little bit of credit on my meters straight away. this phone call was at around they where 4pm. they offered to give me a call when the person was just half an hour away from being at my address. Which wasgreat as i was at a family gathering at the time and not home. the man arrived at 7.30 pm! and i got the phone call in advance! He was very friendly and happy to help, fitted the meters with in half an hour,gave me the indoor smart meter plus manual and both cards, showed me briefly how it all worked. I had a couple of pound credit on each to start me off.i had a bit of an issue to begin with, which was the only downfall,My gas card was working fine, credit going straight on, but my electric card didnt seem to be updating the credit as i topped up, as i was all very new to it i had got a bit confused with the emergency credit, thinking it was topped up but seemed to be going down faster than before.i finally sussed on a few days later it just couldnt have been processing my top up. Phoned up customer services, they had me keying in loads of really long number codes into the indoor machine, still wasnt accepting, i lady phoned me back a few times as the machine needed to rest and we then realised it must be to do with the meter box out side, had to type all the codes in yet again outside! But all my money finally went on!! The lady was very friendly and helpful! and the fact i had to type in about 5 20-40 digit codes around 3 times each with out making any mistakes, it was a bonus the lady was so well and clearly spoken!! I love the fact i can also check how much gas or electric i have used that day, and how much i used the previous week/month! We have been on a mssion to get it as low as possible, ws getting lower and lower each day by cutting back and i could see the read the difference! we spend no more than GBP4 day and night on both gas and electric, with the gas cenral heating on at night! No doubt cheaper soon as the heating can go off completly! I also love the fact i can top up on line, so much easier than almost running out of credit and having to rush to the nearest shop 10 minuts away with a small walking child. I absolutely LOVE this company!! Thank you!
5568|Firtly when we moved in they billed both us and the previous tennants for gas / electricity and no one would ever have know if we didn't know the previous owners well. A number of mistakes by them on the Direct Debits lead to them pulling large lumps out in access of GBP700 without notice. We cancelled over 4 months ago and they have still not refunded GBP400 of over payments. Call center service refused to allow me to speak to a manager or finance. I would avoid this company at all costs.
5569|I was told great things about Utilita, it was easier, cheaper, etc. I had my new metres installed 2 weeks ago and already it's a nightmare!! First of all the smart metre broke, so we could not check how much was left and Utilita refused to replace/mend it unless we pay GBP250. Then our Gas supply went off, the day after we had put GBP10 on it, so we called them up and they said that they can come out, but we would have to pay GBP250.No other energy supplier will change the metres back, so we are now left with no gas forever.AVOID AT ALL COSTS, IT'S NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!
5570|Stay well worst mistake my mrs made they have pushy sales man I'd love one off them to come knocking on my door nowIt has cost over GBP500 pound in two month now in process off changing over got some legal advice hopefully see em in court, my advice to every one is get out u not in contract after four weeks with any Electric or gas supplier
5571|I have been with Utilita for a few months now, had the new meters installed and they are amazing. Before I had to go to the shop all the time to top up... Now all I have to do is log online to top up or send a text. Very simple. Also means i can top up at work when the credit is low. I can now see what I am using each day, can see what uses energy at what level. Friendly credit is great means I can rest assure that the electric wont go off over night and over the weekends so no more waking up and no lights in the middle of the night, and no more defrosting of my freezer.  Very handy! I would recommend Utilita to anyone because the tariffs are cheaper than all the big suppliers and no standing charges so only pay for what you use!Overall very Smart meter so much better than those old key and card meters, get with the times people, time to move on!!!
5572|***WARNING*** PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH UTILITA ARE ADVISED TO CHANGE ! Aparintley i have used GBP20. of gass in 3-4 days NOW GASS IS OFF after i went out to top up for more gass the supply is still off, after i phoned them up and explain the problem and that i got an 8 year old living with me thay told methere is a fault and they WILL NOT COME OUT UNTILL 8AM Tomorow morning ! all my rooms is currently 6 degrees and dropping ! with no heating, THEY ARE DISGUSTING i called them around about 9pm !
5573|I signed up with Utilita a year ago now because they were cheaper than my current supplier and liked the idea of the smart meters and not having to trek to the shops to top up my gas and electric. Was told by staff that there was a delay in installing the meters and I was looking at the end of Jan, early Feb but was given a card and key in the meantime. Got to May and still no appointment to fit the meters. Six months after signing you can Imagine, I was getting very annoyed by this stage!!!! Then 8 months later in July still no meters, I then called them and spoke to a member of their team, who admittedly was very friendly. I wasn't getting anywhere and was told they were sorry they were having problems with the smart meters. I then lost my temper and asked for a callback from a manager. 2 days later, no callback, so I rang again and said if they didn't call me back today I would report them. Received a callback from a manager who was very nice and helpful and gave me an appointment over the phone for BOTH meters to be fitted. At last I had got somewhere. Engineer arrived on the day only to be told he was only fitting elec meter, was fuming, had taken the day off work. Called them and another appt was arranged to fit gas meter. Got sorted eventually but a load of hassle and smart meter keeps conking out and not registering when i use energy, have to keep removing the batteries and re setting. Already had a replacement smart meter but has done it again. Engineers are lovely and helpful but service is quite poor and a hassle. They have just increased their prices again by 9.5% but are still competitive. Will stay with them for now but will look around for a better deal. Have saved money though since switching over and the smart meters (when working properly) are a great idea. You just top them up online with your debit card, key a code in and your credit goes straight on. No standing charge either which is a bonus. I would recommend them if you are not in a hurry to have the smart meter fitted, as they are quite competitive!!!         
5574|Since last year with the old British gas double hyped up prices I had no option but to uswitch! AND so bloody glad I did, this company came up trumps miles ahead with value. British gas had coincidently messed up my metres and they was rolling ahead when this company took over they realised I had been over charged and refunded me the best part of 70 pound with my metres returning to the normal flat rate. I was dubious on initial sign up with the company as they had been around back in 05 but had ceased trading so anyway I still went ahead VALUE easily pleases me. To this day they still come cheaper on compare results I never have to rum around for top ups simply and easily the best choice I ever made also I have never had any problems with cut outs etc.. smooth and plain sailing! JUST ONE HECK OF A BRILLIANT ENERGY COMPANY!!! 
5575|"I got a nice sales person knocking at my door at 2.30 pm telling me that all the prepay meters in the UK are now changing to a new technology and installation on my street is scheduled in 6 weeks time and he explain to me all about the new system and ways to top up. I told him how come Eon who is my supplier didn't let me know what is happening and he just looked at me and said with a confidence that Eon was bought by the new company. So I said that's strange because I haven't heard about it. So then I asked him if he is trying to switch me to a different supplier and he replied no I am here only to explain to you that the pre pay meter system is changing and how it will work and that he only need to take some details and obtain my signature. So I just laughed and said "" Look mate I know you are a sales rep and all what you are doing is trying to switch me to a different supplier. "" I said good bye and shut the door.I do like the system Utilita is using but I will never switch to them because they sales reps are saying lots of lies."
5576|Pleasant salesperson, metres installed, we were given five pound credit on both metres, easy to top up all I do is send a text message and the metre tops up direct from my bank.Only fault is that I signed up when I was told how low the rates were, then before the metres were installed the price went up, they should of honoured the agreement!Still very low priced units with no standing charge
5577|we changed to utilita afetr talking to a very friendly salesperson, it took about three months for the changeover to process and before it did we had a letter from utilita saying they had out up the prices but 17.5%, i wasnt very happy about this but still we had no gone outside cooling off period. Still 12 months later and no meters fitted, we decided to move to EON and give them a go, but NO we found out that utilita had stopped the process. Then in the middle of cooking a meal the gas ran out, I put the emergency on and it clicked to say that we would have the emergency gas credit....then stopped and said HELP call services...I had to finish off cooking with a microwave and george foreman. It seems that the gas had been remotely turned off by utilita who were now wanting to fit their meters....AINT GONNA HAPPEN...i'd rather do without gas...by the way we have a large family including a 7 month old baby and we have no been without gas for two days...I will update you as to what happens next....I notice some people have had very positive experiences with utilita on here and thats good to hear...but for me I won't be using them again, neither would I reccomend to a friend..Brian and emma lees Leyland
5578|just had a sales man from this company at our door, he was very friendly and what he was offering sounded great, i was tempted to sign up there and then however i am no in the habit of doing things like that, so he left his number with me to contact him when i had looked a bit further into it. i was interested but after reading these reviews i think i will leave it and stick with my current supplier ( cant give accurate stars as i havnt used there service but wouldn't let me continue without them) hope all you poor people get it sorted xx
5579|We had a sales person come to the door to ask if we wanted move companies. The sales person never let us say no in regards to moving he pushed us to say yes. My partner said yes to get rid of the sales person. We was told that we would receive a phone call within 2 weeks to discuss what we wanted to do. Within the 2 weeks we tried phoning the company to tell them we don't want anything to do with them. We could not get through to this company it seem like they were a fake company because we had no answer. After a threating email to take them to watchdog someone come back to me to advised that our electric and gas had been moved over to their company without our permission or say so. I will never trust someone again, it has taken me 4 days to get response and also to sort out all the back log of this situatuion. NEVER TRUST UTILILA!!!!!!! 
5580|Was spending about GBP30 a week with british gas on my electric , changed to utilita about 6 months ago , we only us about a tenner a week now and theres 4 of us , took a while to get the meters fitted but have them now and theyre fine , they send you out a new key for ur meter in the meantime while ur waiting and its just set to a lower tariff. really happy with the company , the price is really impressive , recommend them to everyone. Rochelle, manchester 
5581|I signed up with Utilita few months ago through there Sales Rep, and i have just got my new smart meters installed. Its a Fantastic system for prepay customers and its best value for money, i have been with few other companies in the past and i must say that Utilita have got lowest tariff. I don't have to run around to the shop anymore because i can get top up online for my gas and electric and the best thing is that after Five o clock in the evenings and weekends it will never go off until Ten in the morning, if i ever run out of credit. Highly Recommended guys..Cheers
5582|changed to utilita about 3 months ago after being sold on getting new meters fitted. he also told me that if its after 5pm and b4 10 am or even weekends that if my gas or electric ran out of credit they wouldnt cut off. what a load of s**t. i never got new meters fitted i had to keep my old ones. i had GBP1 on my gas at 6pm turned my heating on only to find that 9pm my gas had gone so me and my children had to freeze all night as all of my shops were shut. the one that got me to change to edf energy is i lost my gas card and rang up utilita and told them i had lost it and also ran out of gas with having 2 young children in the houe (4yrs & 9month) i thought they would come out and put a wind on. i waited all day to get a phone call to tell me if someone was coming out the phone call never came so on my mobile i rang there 0845 number only to be on hold for 20 mins. then to be told that for me to get a wind on would cost me GBP150. :O i said i havnt got this ammount of money so he said because i lost the card im liable to pay the money if i want gas.... so me and my children havnt had a bath and we frooze all night im now still waiting for my gas card to turn up 2days later.. i wouldnt recomend utilita to my worst enemy..
5583|A representative from this company called at my door at nearly 6 o clock in the evening, stating that all the card/key meters in the country were being changed over to their new ones, which sounded really good. As he said my neighbours had all signed to have theirs changed and the office closed at 6, he had to have my signature quick so he could then contact his office with the details. So, i signed for the new meters, and then when i spoke to the person in the office she then said that it meant i had changed my gas/electric supply over to Utilita!!  At that point i said hang on a minute, the man didnt say anything about changing suppliers just that he gave me the impression that it was a service provided by my supplier!  I gave him the copy of the contract back and told the person on the phone that i didnt want to change suppliers and to cancel everything. I do not usually get conned like this as he had not even mentioned anything about changing suppliers, and if he had asked me first if i was interested in changing suppliers and getting new meters then i would of politely said no thankyou!!   Totally annoyed that they can use tactics like that to get customers, i will tell anyone i know about this company, and have put it on a social network so all my friends, family etc can all be aware of them!!  Disgraceful is not the word!!! 
5584|I have been with Utilita for over a year now and the agent who knocked on my door was really good. Guess you must have had a bad one. i have found their meters to be the best thing that i have had for prepay elec and gas. Very convenient to pay where and when i like and i have never been cut off at nigh or weekends. Shure i have has a couple of issues but when i ring the girls in the office they are really friendly and helpful.
5585|"Salesman conned my wife whilst I was at work, said he had called to look at our electricity meter, needed changing was his patter,the missus, thinking he was from EON our current supplier and never led to believe otherwise, was taken in. She needed to ""just sign this form to allow for the meter to be changed love"" She signed, we were then contacted by Eon to say they were sorry to hear we were leaving them!! All's been sorted with Eon and I have reported Utilita to the Trading Standards Agency - we'll see. Didn't want to give any stars to this review, but will not proceed without at least clicking one!!  K. Shanley, Blackburn, Lancs"
5586|Very pushy representatives... I almost felt threatened on my own doorstep but was made to believe they were working in conjuction with my current supplier somehow!! I dread to think how they can make elderly residents feel. Makes me wonder what age bracket holds their highest percentage of customers! Easily bullied bracket would be my guess! Would not recommend service to anyone!  Living in south of england and in the area I do, I have found that Southern Electric combined fuels are the best value for money for me, my partner and our FIVE children. To make their service even better they have the best customer service team I have ever had to be dealt with by.............   STAY AWAY FROM RUDE, ROBBING UTILITA!!!
5587|Utilita have given me nothing but a possitive experience. I did have to over six months for my meters to be installed but I have had thier meters now for a little over two years and I haven't had a problem with them.  The friendly credit facility is great over weekends, evenings and over bank holidays, it meant I didn't have to run out in the middle of boxing day to topup even though my credit ran out!  Reading the other reviews I dunno why they have so many problems. My advice is to ring up and ask for a leaflet and see if it what you want. Thier prices are the cheapest for prepayment so it was good for me.  Hope this helps anyone whos thinking about joining them :)  
5588|Appalling service, in the last 4 months, my gas meter has been cut off at least a dozen times. They blame a comms error, then have the cheek to ask for GBP50 per meter to cancel the contract. Prices are cheap but the smartmeters are a joe - AVOID THIS COMPANY. The staff laugh when you ring them to say how rubbish they are. Its NOT a family friendly company as every other week the comms part of the smart meter does not work
5589|Even though Utilita IS the cheapest Gas/Electricity supplier by FAR, the service is appalling and I agree with everything being written about them. I too have had same problems of being cut off completely when Gas ran out, so no telephone, no computer, no hot water, nothing, and the ony way of contacting them was by my sons mobile, whcih for 3 minutes cot GBP5.00. I am changing bck to Southern Electric as the saving isn't worth the hassle, also I put on GBP50 to run out the next day and was told my meter was not displaying or storing electricity properly, so even though I thought I was in great credit, I was in debit!!  Avoid UTILITA at all costs!
5590|we have utilla in our home and our freedom box screen got broken so we had an engineer out and he told us it was fine and not worth replacing as it was stil working so we didnt and about a year and a half later we called up to see how much gas we had left and was told our freedom  box wasnt working so they sent out another engineer who replaced the box once it had ben replaced he told us we owed GBP400 to them and i said how we have been toping up GBP50 a month and we hardly ever turn the heating on it turns out that none of our top ups have ben going on so now we are toping up the electric and gas GBP100 a month trying to clear some of this 40% debt a month i am so angry about this
5591|UTILITA GAS/ELECTRIC SMART ENERGY!!  am absolutly disapointed with this company, initially door salesman sold me the electricity suppl and decided to stay with curren gas supplier only to be presented 12 months later with a massive gas bill from them, informing me they were my supplier, i NEVER signed anything for this!! so with bill of GBP700 to pay decided to finally have a metre installed to repay the debt, only after installation was i told they would take 40% of any credit put on the acct, not only of my gas credit but also of my electric acct, so am now effectivly paying 80% of any funds i put on my electric or gas acct.  i am absolutly furious with this company, iv ended up with a debt for something i didnt where also every week i have to contact them as when credit low wont automatically put on emergency funds but then decides to shut of valve gas supply to entire house which seems to take days to sort out even when iv put more than enough funds on accts  all in all, i hate this company and can not wait to leave them the entire service is awful, from the pushy misleading salesmen to the complaints dept, never go with this company, im not the only person to not be happy with utilita!!
5592|I had a Utilita sales man knock at my door in the middle of this year.  I was very pleased with what he had told me and was really keen to sign up.  So i did.  They were supposed to have fitted new meters to my house in October and to this day and after 3 emails they still have not been.  Each time i get a reply from customer services it says the same thing each time..someone will call soon.  I am still waiting and it is almost December.  I am going back to E-ON
5593|i agree do not use utilita . bad service if credit runs out on gas they cut electric off. phoned them they said sign up for another 12 months and we will instore a meter that does not do that. you think they would get it right first time. Just goes to show they are still up to thier old tricks. 
5594|I've been with all the big six paying high rates as a prepay customer then utilita sales man came to my house they have no standing charge and give GBP20 emergency credit GBP10 on each meter and even if you have no money left on your meters they still give you gas and electric in evenings and all of weekend they call it friendly credit if your on prepay there the cheapest by far trust me I've had em all
5595|Absolutely appalling in every way. Avoid at all costs. 
5596|I have lost more money than i could ever have saved with utilita. I was without power (gas & electricity) for 25 hours, had to take time off work to wait for engineers- I was shocked that there is no out of hours emergency number (i had to leave msgs on an answermachine telling me they would get back to me within 24 hours). They didnt! I then had to phone them again the next day, had to repeat my problem. Thinking the problem was to do with me i had topped up my credit meter over  GBP50 the previous night. Turns out the problem was theirs!
5597|I would not use EDF if it was half price their bullies,they never sent me a bill and let your bills go through the roof,and do not like you switching suppliers.
5598|We had a very bad experience with EDF Energy.  Out of the blue we got a bill for approx. GBP2000 above expected on our electricity.  We studied old bills and couldn't see why this had happened.  We were confused by readings produced by EDF that were listed as actual readings.  Eventually after months of hassle, worry and phone calls an EDF employee divulged that a number of these 'actual' readings were produced by EDF themselves i.e. they were not actual readings at all.  Eventually we could identify the problem back to the fitting of a new electricity meter by EDF over a year earlier.  It turned out that this meter was NOT a new meter but a reconditioned one many years old.  It had not had its original reading deleted and our bill had been set at zero so we got charged for all the electricity that had previously passed through this old meter.  They eventually refunded all the overcharged amount and we secured a small amount of compensation for overdraft and our time.  But I think all EDF customers need to be careful if a new meter is fitted.  Find out whether it is reconditioned.  Find out whether the reading is zero.  If it isn't zero make sure that you take note of the reading and that your next bill correctly picks this up. 
5599|1/ ESIMATED BILLS The estimated amount is ridiculous and led to my getting a bill for almost a thousand and a half pounds at one Winter quarter as compared to my useage of about GBP300 as usual per Winter.2/ FREQUENCY OF BILLS The bills issued do not come quarterly but more often. In fact they seem to think they can send one when they like.3/ INACCURACY OF BILLS. When it comes to the amount specified on bills this appears to be totally random. I have had two bills on the same day both giving different figures. Also random in between bills asking for amounts that are not owed and do not relate to anything as account is up to date.4/THREATENING LETTERS.  As per 3 and 4 above I have also received letters which are a nonsense stating my bill is well overdue. containing a random amount and threatening me with magistrates court or disconnection if it is not paid within so many days.5/ APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NO EFFORT TO ACT UPON COMPLAINTS. Absolutely no apology when phoning to relate the above and even more infuriatingly continuation of the same.NEVER EVER USE THEM
5600|EDF suited me for a while, price wise. I began to suspect problems might be on the horizon when, for months, their Android app refused to acknowledge my existence as a customer.Recently I wanted to change my tariff. LOL.There was no button or tab I could see. Two Live Chat jokers told me there was a Tariff Options button.There was a Tariff Details button.This is a very long story but to cut to the chase, in the Blue + Price Freeeze box was a blue hyperlink offering more details on that tariff.Bingo! There were the alternatives.BUT when you clicked on the buy this button you entered a quote routine which ceased after stage three by a popup window telling you that, since you were a customer, you didn't need a quote.I tried that loop several times I have been using PCs since 1985 but one guy tried telling I was using the wrong browser. I use IE of course for it is, sadly, the industry standard. The code is broken Customer complaints kept on asking what they could do for me. I wanted to speak to IT support. They said I couldn't. So I said you cannot give me what I asked for. They said that's right. I switched providers and saved myself about 300 quid. And loads of time.Business 101 - have website that works and contact email for support so they can fix broken links and code.EDF need new IT contractors. The current lot aren't up to the job.
5601|I was an EDF customer for over a year and even moved house and stayed with them that's how much I liked their prices and the price promise guarantee. The issue came when I cam to cancel my account. I called to inform them I was moving again and would not be staying with them, I was told this was not a problem, that I was actually in credit and they issued a refund. I was told they would handle cancelling my direct debit and there was nothing else for me to worry about. All sounds great eh?? Well 4 months later - 2 weeks before Christmas I have received a final demand letter for GBP150! When I called to challenge this I was told they had calculated my refund prior to receipt of the final payment, they were unable to take the final payment (appearently I cancelled it but I disagreed as was told they would be) however I therefore owed them the final payment. I have questioned their processes;1. why calculate the refund until the account had been settled? 2. why after they were unable to take the payment did they not inform me as such? 3. why was the first time I heard of the issue a final demand letter? If I was an old lady this sort of thing could cause serious worry and anxiety. As it is I am left with a sour taste in the mouth and am GBP150 down prior to Christmas. Don't bother with EDF, Ultimately their customer service and internal processes are extremely poor - they don't treat their customers like people and no amount of cute mascots and clever tv ads can replace good customer service. 
5602|"We switched from EDF (Gas and elec) to another supplier in Nov 2011.  We disputed our final settlement bill as they appeared to be charging much more than the difference from our last bill that did not make sense. I had several conversations with EDF, and explained it in detail to the reps (who were polite, who understood my point, but were going to ""get back to me"")  In Feb 2011 it was still not resolved even though I was proactively calling them to sort it out. I was told they would call back, but the call never came until....  The next contact came 3  YEARS LATER...(Dec 2014), we get a letter out of the  blue saying they are taking legal action and contacting debt recovery for collection.  I was forced to pay an amount I disagreed with and they were unable to explain to me why! With the threat of balliffs knocking on the door, and just being the ""little man"" I had no choice to pay an amount I did not understand or agree with!.   To this day, I have had no explanation, just a very complicated final settlement bill, with lots of credits and debts that I cannot verify and as far as I can see makes no sense.     All I wanted was an explanation why can't the reading on the day of swap-over be calculated as a difference from the last bill i.e. GBP80 ....simple.they came up with an original figure of over GBP400, which was eventually reduced to GBP230....but still no explanation of the details...  I would steer clear of these guys....in my opinion they after your money and they don't care how.  All very well offering a good service, but beware... they can get you when you leave and there is nothing you can do about it...Just to be clear, I do not try to avoid paying bills, I just want to understand what I'm paying for!"
5603|After having a visit from somebody within the company, our meter readings were taken and submitted online by the company. To our shock we were issued with a bill almost 10 times the actual amount the bill should have been. Being students this was the first bill we had received and could have easily been out of pocket from this extortionate amount if we had not have sought help. We went online and tried to gain some advice from the live chat that EDF offer as a help service, where we spoke to a very unhelpful man who failed to recognise that the bill was ridiculously high for a student household and told us we would just have to pay it. After getting our landlord involved EDF then realised the mistake and issued us with a new bill which was around GBP600 cheaper than the first! When putting this complaint to customer services they were apologetic but uninterested in what i had to say and simply gave me details of how to leave the company if i wished. This is unacceptable customer service and i would advise anybody not to chose this company! 
5604|I have been with EDF for a while and was really surprised to receive a bill which was double the amount of my usual bill. The previous month I was sent a bill for a very small amount with the reason given that I had been paying too much and so the small bill was because of a rebate for my overpayment. So why was my next bill double the amount!! I contacted customer services after a long wait in a queue and they couldn't really explain the reason for the large bill but took a meter reading from me. They recalculated he bill and it was nearly halved so that was a relief. Not really happy that it caused me so much anxiety.
5605|They simply can't get their bills right. Not a clue what they're doing. 
5606|I switched to EDF around January time, after constant appalling service from npower, and cannot imagine a smoother transition. Cheap tariff, easy online registration and clearly communicated payment methods.My direct debit payments have been adjusted with each meter reading based on estimated usage, which after two reviews has been correct to within GBP20. Not only that, but a new balance is available immediately after a meter reading, with a notification of any changes to your direct debit amount.I could not have asked for more from an energy provider - a reliable service which I rarely have to think about, a simple app to make meter readings as simple as possible and honest communications (including updates of cheaper tariffs available from EDF and other providers). Recommended.
5607|This company has not communicated and emails sent to me were not being received..... ended up costing me lots of money! Would not use again BUT WHO DO YOU TRUST!? The best system I have found is the British Gas professional monthly meter readings - this seems far better and you don't get clobbered with an unintended bill....!  AVOID EDF!

5609|Confusing system with loads of tariffs and prepare to be bombarded with loads of junk mail about new tariffs. Customer service is not great, with staff members that don't even pretend they care about having you as a customer. 
5610|EDF Energy Electricity company is one of the best long term tariff providers and their prices are very competitive in the area. they are now offering fix tariffs for February 2016. Recommended!
5611|Stay well clear! I think that is all that needs to be said. A company with systems that their staff can not use. They had mine and my neighbours electricity meters the wrong way round. They have been billing me for 18 months wrongly. It took 20 weeks to get the meters registered the right way round. It took 8 long phone calls, various emails, various meter reading on my part, and they then offered me GBP100 goodwill payment. Disgusting, an absolute joke. These people can not be trusted to look after electricity while you run your business. Stay well clear.They have very cheap introductory rates and then after 6 months the prices rocket. Do not trust there sales people.
5612|Excellent value for money, the cheapest around, they are also very honest & give you refunds based on meter readings if you are in credit. Uk based call centres & great customer service. I would never move from this supplier. I am on blue + price promise February 2016.
5613|Our experience of EDF has been completely different to others reported here. We switched supplier 3 years ago and have been on 2 fixed price contracts since then. Both have been good value and, earlier this year, EDF wrote to us to advise us that a cheaper tariff was available. We were able to switch without penalty, even from the existing 18 month contract. Recently our account was well in credit and we received an automatic refund, which amazed me. Submitting meter readings is easy and the bill is updated immediately. Once a year we receive a summary of our energy usage and the predicted usage for the coming year, on which the standing order is based. I had to call with a query about our account balance a few weeks ago and got straight through. Are we dealing with the same company - couldn't be happier!! 
5614|Even this page is slow to load ,even thought I have a account I can never login ,no one ever answer the phone   After 26 minutes on hold it cuts you off ,staff just tell you wat thay think you should here,they are just a fu;:);)46g joke I cannot stress how much they unrinate you off,you need a degree in astrophysics to under stand their bills even there staff have no idea and just pass you on to another numb nut 
5615|We moved house recently and the current providers were edfFor the first week I had not Sussed out how to use the cooker with a new baby in the house so we lived off takeaways and luckily the weather was nice we didn't need the heating on We took the readings a few days before moving in and after a few days my partner changed us over to the provider we had previously used Obviously this took time to change over but we were landed with approx GBP80 gas and GBP25 elec for 20 days ! What a jokeOur bill is half that with our now provider Avoid edf at all costs 
5616|Read the reviews below. It would take me a life time to write about the incompetence of this company. I am at present writing to their Chief Executive Officer in Paris about the sheer incompetence of their British operation. After talking to numerous EDF employees on the internet and phone I am no further forward in the changeover from Eon to EDF. Eon insist I am their customer even though EDF are taking money from my account. Total and utter frustration aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere.
5617|EDF have taken GBP678 from my wife's bank account with no notification and we were in credit. It is being investigated but every time we contact some one we get a different answer. The last contact resulted in an advisor not wanting to refund the money and change our direct debit to GBP2 per month. This is not happening! Now we have a letter stating our direct debit is changing from GBP51 for electric GBP61 for gas to GBP111 for electric and GBP1 for gas. How ridiculous is that!  No one will call me I want to speak to someone and can't get through, our only contact is live chat which has limited information. The only resolution is revert to my contractual payments and refund GBP678. Please avoid this company. I would rather pay the GBP300 per year I am now saving rather than deal with people like this. I am not an isolated case. Look on trusted reviews or EDFenergy facebook page. They are littered with complaints about EDF. 
5618|"Switched to EDF Blue+Price Promise March 2015 deal 6 months ago - At first it went smoothly. However, after they changed my Electric meter I could not enter readings on their website. I spoke to them a month ago, they assured me it was all in hand. I still could not enter readings but now ould not get through to customer services so sent emails. They asked me for information about the new meter they had fitted, including wanting me to send them photos of it! Then I received a formal notification letter that they had changed me from the fixed price tariff March 2015 to their standard variable which had just increased its price. The new contract stated that I had ""agreed this on the phone"" - which I had not. Could not get through to customer services (at least 30 minute wait). Went on their live chat service. Spent 45 minutes trying to find out who changed my contract. First they said that the fixed price contract had expired a year early! Then they asked me if they had fitted a new meter; then they asked me if I had told them that they had fitted a new meter! Said I could not afford to waste the hours I had spent sorting out their chaos - said I would Switch to another provider if a manager did not call me - sent email to confirm. Heard nothing so have switched to a cheaper provider with a good customer service score. My advice, avoid EDF there are cheaper and better out there."
5619|"Joined EDF through a comparison site a month and a half ago.  Heard nothing from them them until a series of rather criptic emails started coming from them saying there was ""an important message"" for me.  I needed my account number to read them but I have no idea what my account number is as I have had no communication from them. I opted to create an online account in order to view my bill and get access to my account number... I couldn't though because guess what, I needed my account number to set up my account!!! I have tried several time to contact them but not only is the contact number hidden within the website and very difficult to find, you have to sit on hold for what seems like forever and still no one answers.. I have tried using the web chat feature on the website to find out what my account number is but guess what?  YOU NEED YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER TO USE THE SERVICE!I am writing this review after once again, sitting on hold for what is now 47 minutes and still no one answers!  Rest assured I will be changing my energy supplier as soon as possible, hopeless, it's a shame so many modern companies as going this way through greed..."
5620|I bought a flat to rent out and decided to change from British Gas to EDF. 6 weeks later the change had not gone through - EDF kept on changing the date supply would start. It became apparent that the changeover would only be after the new tenant moved in - which was not possible - and so I cancelled the transfer. The new tenant moved in and changed the British Gas Contract into his name. March arrives and I get two direct debits for GBP114 taken out of my account. EDF are billing and charging for the same electricity that is already being billed and paid for by my tenant. Beware - don't sign up with EDF. Totally Useless.
5621|Rubbish Rubbish Rubbish Rubbish Rubbish! Don't even know how I ended up with this company as a supplier. I never requested or signed anything with them, just started getting bills from them. I say started getting bills but for the first 2 years only, then after that they failed to bill me for an entire year even after repeated phone calls and then they started sending my final demands for GBP543 swiftly followed by Notices of Warrants to enter my property. This has been going on since 2012 and I am now leaving it in the hands of the Ombudsman. Avoid this company like the plague, customer services are all very nice over the phone, but never follow up, yet super fast at sending out final demands and threatening letters. Not surprised at all that people are not receiving their money back, but they are more than happy to harass & threaten customers who's accounts EDF screw up. This company is a sham!
5622|I am a customer that moved from the UK at the end of last year, am due a credit of GBP153.74 and have sent email requests over the last couple of weeks with NO RESPONSE. It amazes me how, when they are due money they are all over you like a rash. WHEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND HOWEVER, they seem to avoid you!!!!!!!!!!! I am now overseas as I clearly explained when closing my account, and to be calling the call center to be placed on hold for ages is not an option as that is going to cost me more than the credit is due...... Looks like they are no different to many suppliers out there. POOR AFTER SALES, not happy with the lack of communication and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND them, SPECIALLY if you have money owed to you.....
5623|waited 16 mins for call answer ripped off via prepayment, promised refund never materialised.
5624|I was with this company some years ago but left them. I got my final bill and paid it. After being with my new supplier for two years I suddenly got another final bill from EDF for GBP118 addressed to the occupier. I rang them and the aggressive woman demanded I pay it so I  explained I was no longer with them and my final bill had been paid, She said can, you pay till the date you left us and I couldn't get her to understand I had paid until the date I left them I also pointed out this latest final bill also said ,Your first bill followed by final bill and was addressed to the occupier, how can you have a first and final bill on the same bill. she said well someone has to pay it. I told her well it won't be me I paid my final bill and final means final, last one, end of you can't have two final bills. I said I still have my final bill which clearly says paid and if you pursue this I will be taking you to court and you will be paying both costs and compensation for my time. After some arguing she did in the end submit and three years later hopefully I have heard the last from this disgraceful company.  
5625|working for a letting agent have to speak to all suppliers on many occasions. I find EDF the most unhelpful and unpleasant to deal with. Customer service is horrible and they sound like they are not interested in speaking to any of their customers. We advise all our customers not to use them at their properties.
5626|"I have had to deal with EDF for two addresses I have lived at. On both occasions my dealings with EDF were utterly frustrating and unproductive.  Their ""helpline"" has a typical waiting time of 10 -15 minutes, when you get through the staff may or may not be helpful... their online system is bug-ridden and not fit for purpose. They made numerous mistakes with my details which took ages to sort out. Avoid at all costs."
5627|Of course they aren't, but you'd never know it.  Dealing with them is like being the first customer ever, and having them make it up as they go along.  Utterly hopeless web-site.  Emails that are self-contradictory and asking you to log in to do things that you can't do when you get there.  Latest one was asking me to send a meter reading (already done anyway) by the 26th; email sent on the 28th; sums it up.  And this after taking weeks to take over the contract anyway, so not exactly putting themselves under pressure to perform.  This is a pathetic and deeply broken industry of course, but these really are the bottom of the barrel, and they are STILL going down drilling ever deeper for more swingeing profits at the expense of competence.  Unless you have a LOT of spare time and patience you are desperate to get rid of, don't do it to yourself, it's just not worth it.
5628|Hi friends, Please don't register with this supplier, they have over charged me and are a rubbish company. I was previously with eon and I made a mistake by registering with edf. They have charged me 3 times more than what eon use to charge me.I have contactedthe financial ombudsman who will be dealing with the issue.And I have gone back to my old supplier. Please don'trregister with edf, don't be fooled. 
5629|These people sent me a debt collection notice for a bill I never received, and a house I don't even own! They have a standing charge too. Their call centre cut me off after waiting 20 minutes! I can't recommend this company!
5630|Since switching from EDF in August I have been asking for return of my  GBP175 credit balance.All I get are emails saying the complaint is being dealt with , and the latest email blaming the new energy company.I have spoken to them on several occasions , each time gives a further excuse for non payment.I was led to expect refund after my final bill but NO luck.I am now considering the Energy Ombudsman or County Court to get my money back.
5631|"What a PITA switching from S.Power to EDF. Transferring from NPower to S.Power last year was just as bad. Anything and everything including lost 1st meter reading and 2 weeks later nobody had processed it, and then they entered it incorrectly, over-inflated final bill, online account problems, 10 days wait for a support email response and now my account after 30 days still shows as ""nearly there"", patronising gits! It's yet another messed-up process, to add to a long line of business cock-ups this last few years. It seems the simplest of protocols, and the simplest of business tasks 'now', always ends with a string of phone calls or emails to customer support. You may as well drive down to the companies involved, logon to the PC/system and sort it out yourself. Talk about hassle and stress.I blame outsourcing to foreign lands and job agencies for this mess that commerce is in, or should I say 'big business' as it's always the large companies with employees who are like cardboard cut-outs just dreaming of a move to ""a better job"". Nobody cares any more, there's no accountability or attention to detail, the days of doing a good job and feeling a sense of achievement AKA self-esteem are long gone.Amazing!"
5632|When i purchased a new build property 5 years ago it appeared the builders (or whoever is responsible for these things) had chosen British Gas as my gas and electricity supplier. At the time i was one of the many people who couldn't be bothered with the hassle of changing suppliers so i stayed with BG.3 years later after watching Marten Lewis on the tv talking about how simple it was to change suppliers I went to Compare The Market and found EDF to be the cheapest with a massive saving of approx 30% compared to British Gas and EDF were offering an additional GBP100 credit when taking both Gas and Electric. This was obviously far too good to ignore so I moved over to EDF.Everything went smoothly except after a month of service I found that only my Electric had been transferred so BG were still supplying my gas. I called EDF, got straight through and was told BG hadn't accepted the transfer request so I called BG and after the usual arguments they agreed the transfer.In the last 2 years my bills have consistently gone down while all the other suppliers seemed to increase! I pay my account with a fixed monthly price and when I signed up I was paying GBP97 per month. At the end of last year EDF reduced my monthly payments to GBP84 per month and I received a cheque for GBP160 out of the blue because my account was in credit! In May this year my monthly payment was reduced again to GBP77 per month!I should point out that my house is a 2 bed terrace with me and my partner and being disabled I also work from home so my tv, laptop etc is running from 9am to 1am every day. I was paying British Gas GBP107 per month, fixed DD and I pay EDF GBP77 per month. GBP30 per month is a massive saving to me and the only time I've had to contact EDF was in that first month because BG hadn't released my gas account.I'm writing this review this evening because Compare The Market is now saying First Utility is now cheaper than EDF so I came here to read the comments about First Utility which I won't be moving to after reading the comments so I thought I'd see what people were saying about EDF. I called EDF this morning to explain that I had just done a price comparison and that First Utility had come out cheaper so I wanted to know if they could offer me any incentive to stay with them. They offered me their 'Blue+Price Promise April 2015' which would save me GBP79 compared the standard tariff I am currently on but they proceeded to tell me that I would save an additional GBP70 if I moved to Spark Energy. I was shocked to hear them tell me I could save money if I left them for a different supplier but more IMPRESSED with their honesty! I don't know if I've been lucky with my experience of EDF but I can honestly say that I've been VERY impressed with the service I've received over the last 2 years and I can't recommend EDF enough and despite them telling me I could save money if I moved to a different supplier, I would rather stay with a supplier that has not only reduced my bills every year but has the honesty to tell me the truth about moving!
5633|I began the switch from EDF once their rates were no longer competitive in mid August. First problem with the switch was that they had a disagreement with my new provider about my final bill readings - even though I gave them both my readings. They said this would mean a slight delay in sorting out the final bill but they came through on 17 and 22 October for gas and electric. It showed a credit of more than GBP100. I would have expected the money to be paid directly into the account from which they took my direct debits. Indeed when I called up and spoke to the first customer service rep (having waited 15 minutes for the call to be answered) he confirmed this is what would happen. It didn't, so I emailed them a week later and received a reply in 3 days (not the 24 hours they aim for) that I would now be getting a cheque within 14 working days. I emailed back to say that was not what I wanted - who wants to go to the bank these days! Nobody ever responded to this email. Today I have called up - 20 working days after the cheque was supposed to come but never arrived and this time waited 25 minutes to speak to someone. This person tried her best to help me. Said I could not have the refund into my account because someone (not me) had cancelled the direct debit so now she was issuing a cheque. So here I am still waiting for a refund, with little confidence that this cheque will arrive. No explanation as to why the refund was never credited into the account, who cancelled the direct debit, why the first cheque was never issued - a chain of incompetence really. I will never deal with them again.
5634|Stay away from EDF, so many people I know have had issues with them including myself! Thought all was going fine with them up until we had moved house. As they had the cheapest tariff for us (or so we thought) we changed the supplier of our new house to edf. They obviously had all of our up to date details, including the landline number, mobile, email, home address and also my partners mobile number. 8 months after we had moved I checked our bank online to discover a week previous edf had billed us almost GBP200 without contacting us or sending a bill. We contacted them via live chat as it was late at night and if you try and call you will be put on hold for hours on end. We thought it was just a mistake and even after trying to sort it out via live chat we still had no idea why it had been taken from our account! We had to take money out of our wedding savings to pay for it! In the end EDF couldn't tell us why the money had come out so we called the bank direct, they informed us of the EDF account number and they refunded us the money as it shouldn't have left the account without my permission, unfortunatly we still had to pay nearly GBP40 of overdraft fees. We then realised the account number the bank had given us for EDFs payment was for our old account for the old house, which we had closed and had payed the final bill for! We then contacted edf again, as we hadn't lived there for 8 months we thought it was just a mistake but no, after contacting edf again they then told us it was correct and it was our final bill for that property, they said our old landlord had contacted them to amend our final meter readings (evil git also) we argued that we have the final meter readings from the day we moved out and we provided them with them 8 months previously but they said as we didn't take a picture of the meters they didn't believe us and said they were taking the landlords word for it, we couldnt seem to get them to understand that we hadnt been living there! They have the most incompetent staff it is disgusting. After a few days of heated calls between myself and the 'senior' they said as the bank had refunded us the money they were going to send debt collectors round, for a bill we didnt even owe!! Another point was why was someone other the account holder allowed access to our account to amend readings? We also asked why we weren't informed of there intention to take this money from our account, their excuse was that they didn't have any of our contact details, even though we are still a customer and have got all of our details! And they have the cheek to call their customers liars! The woman dealing with our complaint even agreed that our psycho of a landlord had done it just so we pay his bill but she said there was nothing they could do about it as it was our word against his! They just kept fobbing us off saying they would call back tomorrow. Funny we didnt have to provide a telephone number for them to call us back considering they didnt have our details they did actually manage to call back the next day. Eventually after a couple of weeks we managed to get them to drop the bill from us as of all the mistakes the idiot staff had made, but I still get emails from the online advisor I spoke to saying that they are still going to bill us that money, when I reply to the emails I dont get a response. I have emailed the manager numerous times to complain and again had no response. Needless to say we are switching suppliers! Not worth the bloody stress!!
5635|Had misfortune to switch...website down, poor customer service
5636|EDF are a terrible company.No customer service whatsoever.Happy to call you a liar if your gas reading does not ever increase because they simply refuse to believe that a human can live without gas. (I have no gas appliances).They then ask you to send in photo evidence of the meter reading - basically, they want you to save them from paying G4S to go out and read it. So when I refused to do so, it's a stalemate and they have my money (I switched suppliers and want my credit back). It's certainly not my job to mess around taking photos just to save them money - they can either take my word or send someone out to confirm the reading AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE. So all in all, I would not suggest anyone goes with this company. All they want is your money. They literally have no interest in anything else. 
5637|"EDF seem to come out fairly well in price comparisons for electricity but this is more a case of the best of a bad job as all energy providers are ripping us off.EDF's customer ""service"" is not poor, it's non-existent. They don't care and it shows.Limited information is provided about accounts and energy usage, basic enquiries about tariffs and off-peak periods are ignored (I suspect to keep people paying more than they need to) and complaint handling is dreadful.We were told by the meter man that we are on Economy 10 and so managed our electricity usage accordingly. We have now found out on our first bill that we are on Economy 7 and so have been using electricity at a peak rate, thinking we were on the low rate.They have now decided that our monthly DD is too low, despite our being GBP175 in credit and our estimated usage for the year being less than anticipated at our current DD rate! So they want to increase our DD despite already having a lump of our money.Very hard to plan and budget with this supplier and their communication is terrible. If I'd known this before, I'd have stayed away. "
5638|Edf set up a 25 pound per month dd. Fine then all of  sudden decided to help themselves once a week to my wages. Over an hour on the phone not allowed to speak to a manager as they are having a meeting im slapped with 50 pound of phone call charges and was in credit of 110 pound in my gas only to be told i cant have that money bank. So edf make interest on my money while i face bank charges and phone bills. Worst company customer service ever
5639|I have been a customer for a few years now and I cannot fault them.  Prices have always been the lowest by far compared to the other suppliers and their online service is easy to manage which means I am always on top of my payments with no surprises.
5640|I been waiting on hold for 1 hour and 45 min they hang up first time second time at 82 min they hang up now i'm still holding for last 28 min. I definitely want to leave them. No one answer. Music is rubish. and they play the song over and OVERRRRRRRR ohhhhhhhhhh come on.
5641|I am somewhat puzzled by the other comments on EDF?We switched to EDF to supply our electricity and gas 3 years ago and I have seen our bills stay stable since our switch. We pay GBP64 a month for electricity and gas by direct debitTheir website is good and informative and so easy to enter meter readings.I have recently had telephone contact with them and this was no a traumatic experience quite the opposite in fact. After the phone call concerning the fitting of a new meter I felt I had been dealt with by a professional person who knew her job and was genuinely happy to help me.The fitting of the new meter went without incident. The engineer turned up bang on time,he also called me 30 minutes before arrival to tell me he was on his way. When I opened the front door he greeted me with a smile and a very cheery hello. He explained what he had to do and was very quick clean and tidy doing the work.Thank you EDF
5642|moved my contract 3 months ago, but they are completely unable to organise and agree a final reading. meanwhile they have GBP1000 in their bank they won't give back to meavoid them they are totally useless
5643|EDF cannot be contacted by phone. Appauling customer service. Would not buy from them again. You have been warned.
5644|I have a bill from x/04/2013 - y/10/2013Called today as there is a payment missing off of it, from z/05/2013 to be told there isn't and it is showing on the previous bill - even though the payment was after the last bill was released.my point to EDF was, even if that is the case, surely something covering a time frame should list all payments/costs in that time frame. It's simple, basic sense.It's bad enough that the layout has just chnaged and only summarise that there were some payments and not when, but to miss some off is just poor.
5645|I have been with edf for nearly a year and have now changed to another supplier they are not cheap, customers services are  not helpful,when you get through they speak over you when your trying to get your point across,your final bill is a estimated final bill even though your new supplier will have sent your readings across they say that they have not received them,i have been trying for 6 weeks to get a proper final bill still no joy its still estimated and still wrong even being threatened with ofgen does no good would certainly not recommend these people to anybody
5646|"Amazing how they always seem to be experiencing ""unusually high call volume"". I must be very unlucky because I never seem to ring when they are not."
5647|I received yearly statements and electricity used meter readings taken by EDF was GBP338 yet money paid into the meter for the same period was GBP530. In October 2012 EDF change my prepayment meter as they said my one was too old and since I have been paying high amounts.for 6 months from April 2012 to October 2012 I paid into my meter GBP180 then they change it and from October 2012 to April 2013 I paid into my meter GBP350.EDF fail to see the problem occurred when the new meter was fitted, even if you allow for an increase for the winter months it would not mean I would pay nearly double.They have us over a barrel, how do we prove the meter is faulty or if it has been set wrongly.where can we go for independent help, I am getting very worn down by this.DO NOT CHANGE OVER TO THEM 
5648|I had been with EDF Energy for quite some time before I recently switched and during that time I saw a marked deterioration in customer service and a markedly different approach to dealing with ourstanding bills that can be summed up in one word - aggressive.To cut a long story short if you are a day or two over the bill date you get letters making threats of legal action stating they've tried to call you (but haven't).A debt collector came round after we had switched asking for outstanding arrears that had been settled some six weeks prior.Final meter readings were taken which disappeared into the ether.Final bill was vastly overestimated.Now with CO-OP energy who are so professional they make EDF look like barrow-boy imbeciles who couldn't organise a chimps' tea party.Truly truly AWFUL company.Avoid like the plague.
5649|You can't get through on the phone and  I am still waiting for an e-mail reply.  The live chat disappeared and then signed off so I couldn't get them via that either.  I waited on the phone for OVER AN HOUR and never got through. I started trying at 6.40pm, it is now 7.50pm and they shut at 8pm so that's it for this evening.The reason I am trying to contact them is because they said they would send a bill for my late mother's account until the date of her death, as I need this to apply for probate.  They told me that 3 weeks ago and it still hasn't arrived.  It is two months since we told them of the death.  You would think under the circumstances they might be a bit more helpful and efficient.  Incidentally, of all the companies we have dealt with after my mums death, they are the LAST to provide the required information.Don't go with them unless you want ZERO customer service.
5650|It all seems fine when you sign up to the cheaper rate and easy way to pay by direct debit. EDF set my DD at GBP50pm and as that hadn't changed in the last 3yrs I thought all was ok and it was a reasonable amount. Then I get invoice informing me that they are increasing my DD to GBP247pm 500%increase as they clearly have failed to review my usage yearly and revise. Now I am expected to now make these huge payments. Whilst they seem to admit it not great, they won't do much about it and expect you to still pick up the tab for their inefficiencies. On top of this I can't move providers as they have locked my account until I pay off the GBP1200 arrears they let me build up! So much for competition making energy companies offer a better standard of service. As long as they make their huge profits at our expense they really don't care. The ombudsman are powerless so EDF know they can do this to us. I asked to speak their Director, funny I am still waiting to hear from him.
5651|We've only recently changed supplier simply because we found a better deal. We were with EDF for 18 months and naively assumed they were adjusting our monthly payments according to our usage because that's what they told us!! How wrong were we?!?!Over the whole period we were in credit (at one point by over GBP1,200) and then suddenly were slammed with a final bill of over GBP500!!!! The bills were totally confusing and very difficult to work out. We've never experienced this kind of issue with any other energy supplier. And now we've got to find an extra GBP500 to make up the shortfall of our extremely tight budget.We will be contacting Watchdog!
5652|I have just won x 2 identical bronze prizes.....free telegraph three monthly subscription. It is not.The detail is to leave with them your direct debit details or debit / credit card.How is it free, it boarders entrapment to me.I have queried and raised concerns and would be very interested on what comes back.Perhaps reducing fees would be better than this hit or miss give away.Regards 
5653|I have recently moved out of my flat and gone through the truly tedious process of trying to extract a final bill from EDF.  I will keep this brief as from glancing at this page I can see that many people have experienced similar issues.Moved in to my flat two years ago and called to give EDF a meter readingDespite a number of attempts to extract a bill from them we were unsuccessful.18 months later received a whopping bill and had to set up a payment plan.  EDF assured me that this would cover everything by the date we were planning to move outHaving recently moved we have been landed with a GBP600 bill for only 4 months of usageIt is astounding that they are so useless and incompetent.  
5654|Switched 3 months ago to blue plus price promise on Martin Lewis' recommendation.  Shocked to find out the difference between what I was paying with British Gas.  No problems yet but no app for my windows phone. Watch this space.Overall theres not much difference as my lights and oven are still on.. I'm just paying much less.  They answered the phone quicker too.
5655|After months of undercharging followed by huge bills to make up the shortfall, I switched to a new tariff where I agreed to pay GBP56 a month direct debit. I was told that this would be it, all my electricity would be covered by this monthly payment and I wouldn't have to worry about it. This was 2 months ago. The first month everything was fine, GBP56 was taken out of my account. Then this month I noticed a huge amount of money seemed to have disappeared from my account - when I looked at my bank statement I saw that EDF had taken almost GBP700! This is almost all my wages for the month and left me without enough left over to pay my rent! I phoned up again to demand the money back and was told we shouldn't have been put on a GBP56 tariff, we should actually be paying GBP75. So somehow this equated to them taking nearly GBP700 for 2 months of electricity for a small 1-bedroom flat, in the middle of summer when we haven't had the heating on for ages. As soon as I get my money back I'm switching to another supplier who actually know what they're doing and won't take huge amounts of money out of my bank account.
5656|I contacted EDF when I vacated my property back in August last year, I was advised that my acc was closed and everything would be sent to my forwarding address, only to find out in April that they had continued to take the DD from my bank account! Made numerous calls to several advisors who on each occasion apologised and confirmed my issue had been dealt with yet I heard nothing. I was so stressed and fed up my niece took over and dealt with the issue for me, the advisors she spoke with provided the worst customer service, had no empathy or understanding and didn't feel that EDF should compensate their customers even though they were the ones in the wrong. I wouldn't get my fuel from EDF if it was free, it's not all about price, service matters and theirs was appalling!! 
5657|Received gas bill for winter period of GBP250 based on an actual reading, asked them to send same bill out but with partners name on, they asked for meter reading which I gave, bill arrived for GBP594!!!!  Asked how it could be double the amount when they only took an actual reading one month prior to this (April - only have gas fire on and cooker and even then not often)didn't get a satisfactory answer just said not a faulty meter and basically pay up.  Explained the bill for the whole year [2012] was only around GBP600 so how could it possibly be correct, they are saying in one month I have used approximately GBP250 of gas, still no answer, just pay up.  Then they said they noticed they hadn't sent me out a bill for electricity, that landed on doorstep a week later for GBP395.  Seems they are trying to save even more money by only sending out a bill once a year whether you request it or not.  Leaving me with almost a GBP1,000 for electricity & gas to pay, wrote and rang them to tell them I am being made redundant and no way I could pay that amount all in one go and I offered to set up a direct debit for an affordable amount.  Told me I had to do it on Live Chat, spoke on Live Chat, she said she couldn't make that decision but would refer it to some other department and they would be in touch.  Told her I was worried and she assured me not to worry as she would make a note on computer to ensure no action was taken until it was sorted, that was on 10th June.  Came home today to find a letter marked 'V Urgent' from Grosvenor Legal Services, saying they called to recover the whole of the electric bill GBP395 & GBP36 expenses for them having to come out.  I am completely stressed out, just tried to go on Live Chat, not even available as 'busy', hardly surprising if this is how they perform!  
5658|Have left this rating due to very poor service from EDF, and not just from their appalling call centres.  The straw that broke the camels back for me was that I was working from home today & had a really rude representative of EDF Energy park on my drive without permission, then knock on my door to obtain the latest electricity/gas figures.  I asked reasonably why he had parked on my drive when there was parking nearby & his reply was that he always did this.  Absolutely no manners, and no apology.  On a more serious note, my last two EDF bills were debited from my bank account without my knowledge, the first I was aware of them was when my bank account went into arrears, luckily I had an overdraft in place so was able to sort out without incurring huge costs.  I spoke to EDF and they then sent me 'copies' of the bills I had not received!  As these bills were very large, I was lucky I was able to cover them quickly.
5659|"Changed to EDF in May 2013 from Eon.  Switch went through on 16th May for electric and 24th May for gas.  Received a communication from them to say they would be taking a payment of GBP63 on 4th June so we did not start the account in arrears and another payment on 25th June for GBP138 - fair enough I thought.Noticed yesterday that not only had they taken the GBP63 but eight days later on 12th June they had taken another GBP75 Direct Debit.  I had not been informed this would be taken.  Contacted them by email and was told that the GBP63 and GBP75 had been taken to cover usage in May and the GBP138 to be taken on 25th June was to cover usage in June.  Basically therefore they had charged me GBP63 for two week's electricity in May and GBP75 for a week's gas.I queried this again and asked them why they had not told me they would be taking the additional GBP75.  However, received another email back which did not address this email, simply stated that when I received a bill at ""the end of the year"" (what happened to quarterly billing??) I may be in credit.The last paragraph of the email stated ""I want to inform you further that it is first time that amount has been taken prior since account activation date is later however from now onwards please be informed that there will be regular deduction for direct debit on a fixed date."" - I am not even sure what this is supposed to mean??I have now emailed them again saying I have cancelled my Direct Debit and will settle the bill when it is issued (I am guessing this will now be before ""the end of the year"").  In the meantime rather than continuing to play email ping-pong with them and receiving unintelligible responses I have started a switch to another provider.I would strongly advise anyone to avoid EDF, I have switched several times before and never had the problem before with random Direct Debits being taken.  Also check with your new provider before the switch goes through what amounts they are going to taken and when. Added together the two amounts I have already paid to EDF, the GBP138 they were due to take at the end of the month and the GBP146 I had to pay to Eon for my final bill, I was being expected to pay a total of GBP422 for energy in a six week period. "
5660|1)Poor communication.Did not communicate that they'd terminated my contract and made me incur a massive bill from the original supplier.2) Billed me wrongly over a year later and did not admit it was their fault.3) Call centre is a joke. The wait time is outrageous,the staff are rude, discourteous and passively aggressive.4) Do not care about their customers complaints, have not fed back on a complaint lodged over half a year ago.LEAVE THEM NOW.
5661|I transferred over to EDF in March 2011 as I felt EON's prices were just too high and they were refusing to remove the prepayment meters in my flat.  EDF took both gas and electric accounts over and fitted new meters and I have paid a monthly direct debit to cover both fuels ever since.  Long story short, in February of this year I realised there was an issue as I continued to have EON insisting the gas meter/account was theirs.  On further investigation by EON (who have been fantastic) it transpired that EDF didn't take my gas account over, they 'accidentally' took my neighbours.So....they had been billing me for gas that they weren't supplying for almost 2 years!!  4 months on the situation is still ongoing and I have had no choice but to involve the Ombudsman.   Sadly, EDF have been lax in keeping me informed and updated on what is being done and at what stage they are at, despite the Directors Office handling the complaint.  I always send my complaints directly to the Chief Executive, as I find I get a better response! EON have been a great support, despite the issue or the mistakes not being theirs and I can't thank them enough for this.  Today I find that my gas account has now been closed, my previous bill deleted and an amount of GBP473.71 credited through my ELECTRICITY account.Why?!!  I have paid EDF just shy of GBP2000 since I became their customer and my electricity usage totals no more than GBP900 in this time, leaving my gas usage exceeding GBP1000.  And yet, I am being credited less than half of this amount through a completely different account!!!I am speechless, I am angry and am utterly disgusted that they would try and rip me off like this after having made such a huge error in the first place.  To make it worse when I informed them today that I would expect them to cover any shortfall between the amount they refund me and the amount that EON will ultimately bill me for, I was told that wasn't really their responsibility!!  I am now waiting for a full breakdown of the gas usage that I have paid for, as there is no way that I am accepting such a small credit and have demanded to see my previous bills - as they all have suddenly disappeared from my online account - both gas and electric.Unbelievable. 
5662|"In January we decided to switch energy companies from British Gas to EDF as BG had been undercharging us & sent us a bill for GBP600 just before Christmas! We have been with EDF for 5 months & have had nothing but problems. Our first bill was GBP74 & ever since it has been GBP120. We hardly use our heating as we live in a bungalow, so it doesn't take much to heat it. We were not warned of the increase in price. EDF just tried to take the GBP120 from our bank, which we did not have enough funds in the bank, so we got charged from our bank for failed transfer charges!We phoned EDF the same day to ask what was going on & they told us our bill had gone up. So we transferred some money from another bank account into the one we use for bills. We then paid (the same day).Two days later we got a threatening letter through the post, saying that we owe GBP250 (still to this day, I don't know where they got that amount from, as we pay a ridiculous amount each month!) & if we fail to pay it, then someone from a debt collectors agency will turn up at our house & take the money from us.We rang them AGAIN to find out what was going on. They told us not to worry, that it was just an automatic letter that was sent out when we missed our payment.But come on, a letter that threatening? Not even an email or a letter to say you have missed a payment first? Bare in mind, we paid about an hour after the transfer failed.So we thought thank god thats over!BUT, a few days later, I was doing the weekly shop with my 2 year old daughter & our card was declined! I was nearly in tears!We had to leave the supermarket without our items.I got home & checked our bank, and EDF had tried to take the GBP250 out!Rang them ONCE AGAIN & they said whoever we had spoke to on the phone previously hadn't noted down that we had paid...Then the man on the phone said ""If you don't really need the money, you could just leave it with us, and it can go onto your total, so you might get it back at the end of the year if you're in credit""....WHAT?! We are a young family, struggling to run a business in the recession... Of course we need the money back!We were told it would take upto 12 days for the money to go into our account! So no food for my daughter, for 12 days? No way. I demanded that they told me how to get the money back & asap. They said if we go to the bank, the bank can freeze the payment...So we rushed to the bank to do this. But you'll never guess what, we got a letter a few days later to say we hadn't paid!! :(We have been cutting back on gas & electric for months now, but strangely the price doesn't go down, and it is exactly the same each month! (even when we enter our metre readings online)I have a feeling we are being taken in by these money hungry thugs. We are currently looking to switch or go on a pre pay metre. PLEASE AVOID. I WOULD HATE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE."
5663|"Dreadful company. From the very beginning, when the rude, condescending crone on the other end of the telephone reponded to my request to have the key meter removed and replaced with a standard credit model with ""well, you DO realise that you have to undergo a Credit Search? Which you may not pass"" to the demand for GBP200 when I informed them that I was moving out. I was puzzled. I had dutifully provided a meter reading EVERY month for the 9 years that I lived there. Apparently, EDF saw fit to ignore every one of them and estimate my bills. Hence the deficit. I am now with Scottish Power, who speak to me as if I am an adult on the very rare occasion when I have to call them and always appear grateful for my custom. Unlike EDF, who constantly gave me the impression that I was bothering them. If any level of professional customer service is important to you, perhaps another energy provider would be better for you."
5664|EDF has been a horrible company, they always said they were billing me the correct amount since signing up with them and three years later, after never receiving an adjusted bill or anything I have been told that my bill is over 4k. They had told me that they read my meter once a year ago and that my account was up to date, when I signed up they said that my account would be read and adjusted every quarter which was never done. I never received a bill and they have never made an actual reading at my property, not start or finish! They flat out lie and manipulate, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
5665|I went with this company after having someone visit me on my doorstep saying how they can cut my electricity bills for me, this was Dec 2008. In April 2009 i was finally signed over to this awful company. I was on economy 7 due to having storage heaters so had 2 readings day and night. I had meter readers regularly coming to my home to read the meter and every month i would pay what i owed by Direct Debit. In Novemeber of 2010 and me being 8 mths pregnant i got a letter form EDF asking for me to submit a meter reading even though my meter had been read only a few weeks before. I gave my meter reading and was shocked to find out i owed over GBP900 to EDF i asked why this was and was told the meter readings had been read wrong so night as day and day as night and was asked to pay the money. I said i couldn't possibly pay that amount as was close to christmas, i was heavily pregnant and it wasn't my fault at all i had put my faith in people reading my meter. Nothing more was said at that point. In mid December i noticed that EDF had attempted to take the GBP900+ out of my account, when i called them to ask why they said they had every right to do this! I said i had no letter to inform me of this and they said i wouldn't as my account was on hold. They then apologised. Then in late December when my newborn baby was a few days old they did the same again to me. I had had enough by this point and cancelled my DD and went onto standing order instead. EDF made it that i couldn't go to another energy company until i had paid off this 'debt' so i was stuck with them. EDF eventually offered to waiver half of the bill so i was given a payment plan. I eventually paid off what debt they had put me in in Dec 2012 approx. EDF also changed their bank account details at a similar time and one of my payments came back to me. I rang them about this and was told as a standing order customer i should of known??? I moved to a new energy company finally in Feb 2013 and of yet i am waiting for my final bill off EDF which states i am in credit by GBP250+ funny that they won't refund me that isn't it???
5666|In Sep last year I transferred my gas and electricity supply to EDF. My usage was based on the last 12 months actual usage. The monthly payment was set at GBP94.00 per month. This was broadly in line with my previous supplier but the rate was fixed until 2014, instead of 2013.My March direct debit was increased to GBP168.00 with no notification by email, although I have a paperless account. It turns out I had been advised in March that this would happen but for me to know I would have to check my account.I sent a complaint to EDF on 8th April on the basis that, as well as no direct advice, my account started at the end of September and I was bound to have used more than the average use over the first six months and therefore would expect to use less over the final six months. My contention was that any account would go the same way and so EDF must have known, when deciding the initial monthly payment, that I would have used a higher proportion of my expected use in the first six months and consequently they were always going to increase the monthly cost. In my view this constitutes mis-selling.My complaint was acknowledged by automatic e-mail on 8th April but 10 days later, no further contact.
5667|I don't now yet but the customers serviceWas ok and they have given me a fix priceE.on was ripping me of  any way let u nowHow the out come goes with edf 
5668|The prices were on a par with other providers of gas and electricity. However their customer service was very poor. As a result I left in early Jan and had GBP100 credit. Despite them saying credit will be refunded promptly after complaining a number of times the latest date I have for my refund is mid April.
5669|well where do i start first they couldnt set my account up properly then when moving it took 6 months to pay my final bill finally, a customer service lady done it manually i then recive a automatic bill another 6 months later asking for GBP400 when i had recived a refund, on top of this i found out a few days later a debt collection agency has sent me a letter asking for the money all this stress has been caused by some useless wastes of spaces!!!!!!!!!! 
5670|i asked for my money i was in credit by was told it would be in tuesday now wednesday rang up today and they failed to even put it through. refused to let me speak to a manager! and refused to do anything to transfer it today even though it was there fault! now looking into switching! never go with them they steal ur money refusing to give it back. there is nothing i like what so ever!
5671|I am in the process of changing to EDF big mistake.My transfer will take less time than the 4-6 weeks they estimate actually 26 days which meant I would be leaving Scottish Power 5 days before my contract ends and am therefore obliged to pay an early termination fee.Realising this I then cancelled my new contract with EDF within their 12 day cooling off period but they conveniently ignored this email so I am now commited to EDFand to paying the penalty payment to Scottish Power.What I dont understand is why a customer is not asked when their previous contract endsand when they would like to transfer.I can't be the only customer looking for a new deal when their presant one is coming to an end.Despite sending emails to their complaints department the only impression I get from EDF is that they dont care about customer service we are just a means of makimg money.I think they are probably the worst company I have ever delt with and how they are getting away with it I do not understand.Very poor management and service.DONT TOUCH THIS AWFUL COMPANY!
5672|"I switched to the blue+ fixed tariff about 4 months ago and everything was going so well until...I tried to switch the bank account used to pay my bill, contacted customer services and was assured everything would be fine.  My account was GBP191 in debit at the time (not too unusual as it was the end of Fed and I'd only opened the account in December).  The next thing I know, I'm sent a bill for the full GBP191 expecting payment two weeks later.  Customer services inform me this is becuase I had ""cancelled my direct debit instruction"" ...NOT TRUE as the bill stated they would be taking payment by direct debit (from the NEW ACCOUNT!)Since then, I've been back and forth with customer services, who never answer the phones and send e-mails which always fail to answer the question.  Thought I was getting somewhere when I received my first comprehensible resonse after raising a formal complaint - the advisor agreed to increase my direct debit to cover the outstanding debit rather than taking a lump sum - I agreed to this but have heard nothing since.So I now have NO IDEA how much money is going to come out of my bank account TOMORROW!The e-mail service is prompt but never answers the questions.  The one real answer I did receive cam from a ""complaints handler"" who provided her own e-mail address which turned out to be invalid!SHAMBLES!"
5673|EDF are the worst electricity company around in my experience with them. I have received nothing but hassle off them they are trying to charge me for somebody elses bill and said because the bill is in my name that I am responsible for the bill... In knowledge this is illegal..!
5674|I think it's all been said. Truly awful service in every way. For sheet incompetence I have never sen anything like it. Have switched now but still have outstanding issue over what I believe to be incorrect bill.Please, don't even consider using them.
5675|Changed to EDF Blue Price promise 4 months ago and I now regret it. Messed up my payments and personal details which I could not update as they had recorded them wrong so wouldn't reconise me when I went on line. When I went with them they took a meter reading and assured me that the agreed amount was more that enough to cover my bills, and that as my price was fixed it would only change if my usage went up. I am so careful electric and heating and have even turned my thermostat down by 1 degree this year.I made my latest meter reading on 6th March, and two days later I received a bill saying that my gas direct debit will be going up by GBP38 per month and that I am GBP300 in arrears!!!. This is impossible due to the short time I have been with them. As expected on calling them and listening to them border on speaking in another language in KW terms, they are right and I am wrong. Cannot argue my case as every time I put my point across  they have an answer. I will not pay the extra charge and now have to look to change suppliers again. At the end of the day, we are being ripped off by all the suppliers and greed enables them to charge what they like. But I would say do not change to EDF. Their customer service is terrible (that is if you can get through), and they completely mislead you with their prices. 
5676|The most disorganised mess of a company. Regret switching to them and never will again even if they claim to be the cheapest. Switched my electricity to them, then my gas. This was my first mistake, doing this separately caused no end of problems. Id signed up for paperless billing and was told i could look at my bills online. They suggested I merge the two separate accounts for gas and electricity into one account, I thought that sounded sensible and agreed to it. This led to me not being able to view any of my bills online for 12 months, which is the amount of time it took them to merge the accounts. This made it hard to follow what i was paying. I ended up getting bills posted to me for my records. Once they did merge my accounts for some reason it cancelled my direct debit payments. I was not made aware of this so have a large bill looming once I have finally managed to leave this shambles. The amount of times I've waited 45 minutes on hold to speak to someone about account issues or automated letters that don't apply to me is ridiculous. I've switched to another company but am still in the process of finishing with Edf. I'm Waiting for the final bills to settle my account, but still haven't received them, although I am getting texts telling me to pay my bill!!!! Even after I spoke to them a couple of days ago. Can't wait to be rid of this company.
5677|Been with EDF Energy for just over a month now and had my Gas & Electric bill which in my opinion is far to high, We always turn lights off when not using them the only thing on in this house is the PC, & TV on a daily basis my Electricity bill came through at GBP92.01 for one month, My misses uses the radiators about 2 or 3 hours a day sometimes not even that and we got a gas bill for over GBP82.01Do not know how an earth these people can say they are cheapest and that blue price promise is a load of rubbish I ask people i know how much they roughly spend on Gas & electric per month and they say GBP50 - GBP60 on Gas - GBP50 on electric
5678|Switched to EDF's Blue+Price Promise 3 months ago. It appears they have managed to bungle setting up my Direct Debits so I am paying far too little. Was previously with Scottish Power - had no problems with them at all and now regret switching. Before that with Virgin Energy - terrible, took over a year to for them to fix a billing problem - basisically they could'nt bill me for electricity for about a year. I fear something similar is happing again with EDF.Why do these energy suppliers have such difficulty in billing the correct amount?
5679|I have been with EDF Energy for Gas and Electricity for almost two years now and even before I started with them I had problems, they had set up direct debits without my prior authority which I would say is illegal.  Anyway within the time I have been with them, they have missed taking payments from my bank and I would say that this is continuous, they don't care when you email them.  On 31 January I submitted meter readings and they didn't bill me, I had an email trail with a few of their executive team, they then cancelled my direct debit and went into my account without permission and deleted the meter readings I have given them, they should not be entering into a customers account without going through security with the customer, alone changing or deleting figures.  As a consequence of all this I have sent a complaint to the Energy Ombudsman, the Information Commissioners Office and OFGEM.  I would not go to this Energy company at all.The Executive team are just oblivious to what you are saying to them they don't help you out, they hang the phone up on you, they are just plain Ignorant.
5680|EDF failed to correctly set up the DD for my bill.  3 months into the contract I received a threatning letter saying we will be taken to court for non-payment.  No previous notification received. When i ring them they are like automatons on the phone but finally one of them admitted that EDF had made a mistake and apologies, setting up a new DD.  Today, Jan 13, we receive a letter telling us that they are seeking court action for non-payment of the bill and that they had tried to contact us on numerous previous occasions.  When I ring through I get the usual automaton.When I finally speak to a manger they tell me that the previous contact had been to a web based message service, of which I knew nothing, not to me personally.  Also turns out they had stopped my direct debit in error.  This is a terrible terrible company. Their customer service agents seemed pre-programmed to blame the customer and are completely unable to speak normal conversational english.I cannot advise people strongly enough not to do business with EDF.  They will muck up their bill, they will threaten you and they will try and balme you for their admin failures. AVOID AVOID AVOID
5681|EDF have managed to put a 'civil collection agency' onto my new address - in order to chase a bill which has already been paid - i was in rented accommodation and had received my deposit back - WHICH YOU DO NOT GET UNLESS ALL BILLS HAVE BEEN SETTLED and i have now been forced to pay an extra 74 pounds - although as i said i already had evidence of this being paid as their debt collectors or harassers were becoming too much - a company called LCS. An outrageous situation, making me ill. I hate EDF and wouldn't trust them to supply food to a budgie - without creating ill feeling. 
5682|My problem is paying them any money. It took them 6 months to accept that I existed and now I have left them they continue to chase money even though I have letters from them agreeing I have paid in full. They are now threatening to shut the electricity off, but they do not supply me Scottish Power do, and yet when I call them all I get is that these letters are sent in error. I am keeping a log off all calls and promises, all letters and e-mails and it really is consuming hours of my time. I tried talking to Steve Hayfield their Customer Services Director but he is not 'customer facing', (sorry I though he was a customer services director). I have written to him only for my letters to be passed back to the call centres who just do not know what they are doing. So be warned DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
5683|Hi, i changed to EDF when Uswitch said they was cheaper OMG i have never paid so much electric in my life no one is at my property in the day and I usually spend GBP10 a week and now im spending GBP25 a week i know prices have gone up but this is a joke. i called and ask why this is they got me to check to see if there was a debt on the meter and there is not. so they want me to take a reading for 4 days grr you just lied when i signed up about your prices. the only good thing is they have a free help line number which takes you 10 mins to get through on.the lady could not argue i was paying a lot as she could see i top up GBP10 2 days ago and have no run out!!i would say british gas are cheaper and Eon are for gas and Eon are also great at helping and when my gas meter did not work they came out the same day to fixs it. i would recommand these companys please stay away from EDF!!! i wish i read these reviews before changing.PLEASE DONT MAKE MY SAME MISTAKE!!!
5684|"My last bill a few weeks ago stated that they would increase my DD by GBP10.00 per month in January 2013. At the bill date I was GBP170.00 in credit so I called their ""customer services"" and told them that I did not want to increase my DD and the young lady said she would take care of it.I emailed to confirm that I did not wish to pay the increase.I got a reply back that they would carry on with the increase as I would use more power during the winter and this would be to my benefit after calming down I phoned and emailed that I would report EDF uk to their parent company and to the DD system and the energy ombudsman.I will wait until January and see what happens."
5685|I have been with EDF for almost 18 months and I have never been able to submit an online meter reading. The website just won't accept it.They have also made billing errors that they refuse to correct.Customer service is a joke. It's as if their computer system makes decisions at random and no-one in the call centres has the authority to correct the mistakes. That's if you ever get through in the first place, because you end up on hold for ages. E-mail support is even worse because it takes at least 2 weeks to get a response and the response is rarely helpful.
5686|I am in the middle of changing suppliers, sorry i did now as it has taken 4 months, now they require picture of the meter boxes, also had to call them about 3 times, each call takes around 40 minutes to answer, were are the staff especially during the winter months. terrible company would not recommend.
5687|Where to begin! I switched to EDF in May and regret it horribly. I was drawn in by a cheaper tariff and signed up initially for monthly DD payments. I used to pay quarterly online with Npower and never had any problems so i contacted EDF to ask to switch to quarterly payment. I may as well have asked for the moon on a stick. After 3 emails to them and 3 very slow responses confirming the change had been made i continued to recieve monthly bills.It was as though the amounts had been plucked out of the air and sent to me at random intervals. i tried to call the customer services team but gave up after 15 minutes of being on hold. After emailing again i eventually recieved a scanned letter via email to say the change had been made.SO after having paid bills every month i then recieved a quarterly bill for GBP198 for the period i had already seemingly been paying for.I tried calling again and spoke to a chap in the customer service team. He didnt understand what had happened and muddled around with attempting to work it out. Despite me attempting to enter meter readings online (a whole other issue) I was told the amounts had been estimated. I was then promised an email response by 6pm that night. that was 5 days ago. i wrote a complaint email 14 days ago and am still yet to hear a response. i've switched back to Npower. Never again!
5688|I am just about to move energy companies for EDF, After chasing them for nearly a year they all of  a sudden produced a bill for GBP690 for electricity, they then billed me for 1 month for GBP188.60 and then again for this month of GBP93.92 - Who uses that much electricity especially since I work full time and I am hardly ever at home!Phoned them and they claim it could be because the bills are estimated and if I wanted to rectify then I would have to produce a meter reading (Eh - What am I paying for surely they have meter readers)Rubbish service and very overpriced - I will never use them again.
5689|Am leaving EDF after 8 years based on tariff, and shocking customer service....who has got a spare hour to wait for them to answer their phone? I dont care if its a freephone number-just get your staffing sorted to take the volume of calls you have! Its ridiculous!!!!
5690|Had an account with EDF until Sept 12 left as only available tarrif was Standard.Move accounts elsewhere ( gas to one firm electric to another. Cheapest way?)Then tried to recover credit balance. 3 times various statements it was being done all with long waiting time for phone answer. Guess what no refund. Trying again today waiting on phone 18mins so far still no answered.Whoops phone goes dead after 27mins.........Email waste of time as minimum answer time is 10 days. Have known emails to take up to 20 days to answer. The other problem is the answer often has little to do with the question raised.I dont know what the answer is as having dealt with 5 energy firms they arepretty much all the same.One wonders what OFGEM is doing to earn their wages.  
5691|"My father receiced a phone call from EDF trying to sell him their electric and all he said was ""send me some info and I will look at it and see if you are cheaper"" but EDF took that as a green light that he wanted to switch to them ! .I have phoned them twice both calls took over 30 minutes to answer ! which just shows you what kind of company they are.They say they can't do anything because they have to go through due process.I am getting onto ofgem today in the hope they will do something as he neither asked for or wanted their electric.I was with this company myself on an economy seven meter and after a year they still couldn't read their meter (which they had fitted!) , they kept getting the night and day units mixed up which proves what a totally incompetent conpany they are."
5692|"You get a mail saying your bill is ready for viewing and when you try to access it you can't open the files.   E-mail complaint will be responded to in ""10 working days"".  Hanging on the phone for 30 minutes to try and speak to someone....   Monumentally inept."
5693|I changed from npower to EDF in Sept & regret itThey are imposible to telephone unless you call at 8.30am & do not answser emailsEDF linked my acc an address 250 miles away & linked a 2nd acc no to my detailsAfter weeks of contacting EDF they have promised that it has been sorted & my acc reset - it hasn'tAfter 8 weeks I will contact the ombardsman
5694|Trying to set up a direct debit with EDF. Tried online but won't accept meter readings. Tried to phone but hanging on for ages. Finally gave up and tried again online with estimated meter reading - website just breaks down all the time. Did not have any trouble with previous energy supplier.
5695|Dual Fuel with EDF... Email confirming this and the payments ie so much for electric and so much for gas. Electric GBP500 in credit ( what's going on here then) No gas account has been set up all money has been pd off Electric. Pay the GBP500 off Gas but have a debt told to set up payment plan. Pay by DD seem to get a letter every month changing amount we need to pay! 17th November 2011 email to say December payment GBP133, EDF take GBP194 ? 3 weeks later they try to take another GBP133 . we no longer feel that we can pay by DD as we like many others run on a tight ship and can not have unexpected monies being taken. We also ask them to remove our email and contact via letter. Threatening debt collectors letter April 2012 no other correspondence received. we phone and pay each month so much off our current usage and the payment plan payment ( payment plan set up to pay back debt they created by not setting up our account properly) Operative pd full payment off current bill and nothing from payment plan this is what generated threatening debt collectors letter. Guess what they had made contact via email?? Confirmed again NO email contact. September 2012 threatening Debt collectors letter no other correspondence no bills nothing since February. Guess what they had again been emailing. Again the payments we were making had to been enough and we had another debt. A debt created by them by mis management of our account. Whilst making our payments over the phone each and every month not once did their operative say did you know there is a problem with your account or we have been trying to contact you! The biggest insult is that we now find out they have taken our 6 percent discount away because we don't pay by DD. Why don't we pay by DD ? we are not a young couple and have been running a home for 25 years never have we been treated in such a disgusting manner. 
5696|Terrible service, and their website is not even usable, which complicates things even further. Every bill I've gotten for them I've had to chase up myself, spending hours in phone queues - just to be able to pay my bills!
5697|Impossible to be assisted at the Call Centre, reflecting extremely poor customer service.Impossible to submit the meter reading online, as the system does not work. Very frustrated with the service!! Very poor service!!!!!!!!
5698|I'm still on hold to their call centre - 15 minutes and counting. Same story everytime I call - don't bother with this useless company
5699|We moved into our mew home and EDF came and fitted a new economy seven meter and after six months of them mixing up the daytime units with the nightime units we have given up and changed to another supplier as they don't even know how to read their own meter ! 
5700|We were with EDF through Sainburys (How have not dropped EDF) Rubbish service., it takes at least 30 minutes to speak to the call centre. When we moved EDF sent us about 5 different final bills all with different amounts! Then if you don't pay up with a week this company is sending letters advising of debt collectors! In summary an awful company. 
5701|Agree with others that you have to hang on for ages before they respond to calls. We moved into a flat with a key meter. Someone stole the key and then the saga started. We just could not get them to issue a new key or replace the meter with an ordinary one as they wanted an electrician to certify the place was safe before supplying electricity. Guess what - the electrician said he needed electricity to check things before he could give us a certificate - total catch 22.I am waiting to speak to a manager - if they choose to ring back!
5702|I worked for edf for over 6 years , i used to love my job , then in came Sap...............awful system takes what it wants from customers d d accts, makes customers over drawn and no reason why! its awful a pile of s@@@t , the big bosses dont listen , have of them havent a clue what is happening, an dcant use the system, the staff are miserable, they only stay for the pay cheque....... 80%  are off sick with stress. and depression, it used to to take me 5 min to book a job , now to do the same work it takes 40 min, its pathetic, awful ,place to work as in the system, it used to be great at EDF, untill thst system came in , then it did and so many staff have left, the queues are over 50 min wait , then you arnt sure if your acct has been delt with correctly...... if they just cut there loss,s and got better system it  would make sence, over 7.000 complaints each week...................................... if you are on a d debit ...............................be very careful... the system has amind of its own..
5703|Have No Customer Care are not Helpful in annoying Current way then are doing do care to fix on going problems have filed in duty of care and principle no standard of care good manner and tell lost of lies .
5704|Other companies offer an easy pay system on their websites, but not EDF, the site is useless and doesn't recognise my last name. I should be able to pay online, it's ridiculous. 
5705|Find another supplier they don't need your custom
5706|Tried over a 2 week period to contact customer services, to be on hold upto 15 minutes of my time;gave up in the end. This has happen before when I have wanted to discuss my account and never succeeded in getting through. The only time I managed to speak to someone was when I cancelled my direct debit to stop them taking a large lump sum I could not afford. Tried again to phone them to sort my account out and surprise, surprise straight through, because my number must have flagged up I owed money. That is my theory anyway, because now my direct debit is set up again no one wants to answer my call. Not happy as I have had two letters saying they are taking 2 lots of payments out one after another. Only one thing for this ......
5707|I have been trying over the previous 4 months to register for the Blue tariff before it was withdrawn.I tried registering online, but could not as their website said I was not a customer, so I telephoned and gave my details.  Informed I was now on the Blue tariff and I would get my registration pack within 2 weeks. Countless telephone calls after the 2 weeks and still nothing, I'm told that it is on its way.  I telephoned on the 22/9 only to be told that the tariff no longer exists, so I make a formal complaint.  I am promised a telephone call and guess what......... no call.  Telephoned again this morning and informed there is nothing they can do, I have missed out, tough luck they say nothing to do with our professional staff, I ask for the executive office address or email, told that they will not give it to me.I hate EDF and will definately go elsewhere.Avoid............ avoid............... avoid!!!!!!!!!!
5708|Don't listen to any rubbish that EDF Energy tell you about changing tariffs and meters. It's all a load of drivvle! They WILL come and and install a meter FOC, but then their incompetence means you DON'T get put on the cheaper tariff they sell you, and when you ring to query it because you have received no paperwork from them, they tell you that the cheaper tariff has ended. Again, had their incompetence subsided for a while and they had managed to send out any paperwork with the details of the new tariff, I would have known this instead of ringing today to speak to some total (fill in the blank) who was being fed lies by her supervisor. But then again, if their incompetence HAD subsided for a while, they would have been able to put me on the right tariff, like I had asked anyway! It took them 12 days to respond to my email to enquire as to when my change was happening, and then when I phoned it took 30 minutes in a queue to speak to someone. 
5709|We am dealing with appalling service from EDF.  Me and hubby both work odd hours and when they came to read meter no-one was in.  We then received a letter on the in Sept telling us they were taking us to court to gain access to our home to carry out 'a safety inspection'...about an hour later a meter reader knocked on the door - I let him in, he read/tinkered with the meter and left.  4 days later, I receive another letter, this time saying they are going to court for a statutory notice for lack of access!!!I ring up and say, err, someone came on the 4 days ago and did that..nice lady on the end of the phone says we have no record of either of those letters being sent to you (or any meter readings taken)! I say, well I have them here and for the record the first number on the letter It just rang just rang and rang and never got picked up and the second number on the 2nd letter directed me to G4S!!! whats that all about!Nice lady says, I will look into it and get straight back to you...several phonecalls later, still no-one has got back to me.  The court date for the 'entry warrant' is due on the in 10 days - are these numpties now going to break my door down to inspect their bloody meter?? After I have spent thankless hours on the phone to faceless people trying to say YOU SENT SOMEONE LAST WEEK and who the hell came into my house and tinkered with the meter and sent me two separate letters advising of their intentions?? Incidentally, when we first moved in they did an estimate of a quarterly bill and I set up a DD with them based on that...happily paid that amount for 3 years (meter readers came and went at least twice year, so you would assume all is well in the land of milk and honey..), then got a whopping backdated bill for over GBP1,500.00 - After arguing our point with EDF constantly (we had regular meter readers come - but EDF flatly denied ANY METER reading had ever been taken by their operatives and we owed the backdated money because the all readings were estimates!) Eventually, hubby just didn't want to fight anymore as it has been so stressful and agreed to have a prepayment meter put in to pay the backdated amount...afterwards I realised the meter had been imperial and realised (as the last owner died - and wasn't found for a while either) we were in fact being most probably billed for monies not paid by the last owner - BUT we couldn't prove it as the meter was gone.This company has no thoughts for it's customers, they use underhand and almost criminal tactics and when they are in the wrong stick their heads in the sand and use every denial known to man to not take any blame.  The Government should be putting caps on energy prices and investigating their shoddy work practises - In my opinion they are no better than loan sharks. 
5710|On average over 3 calls it was over 15 minutes each time listening to awful hold music - how bad can a company be.....
5711|"These con merchants came and changed my electricity meter, never bothered to show me how the meter works. When I phoned them for assistance on how to read the meter, all they kept saying ""press the button on the meter. There is no buttons to press, 3 sets of numbers that flash approximately 10 seconds, but no idea which is reference to night which is day and what the third number is all about. Well neither did EDF Energy, useless. I made several complaints, and nearly 7 months later, they send an engineer to show how to read the meter. Then the next day they send meter reader G4S, (let's not even go there), who did not read the meter properly. The send me a bill of hundred's of pounds. When it was finally corrected after several angry email and phone calls, I was left with a bill of 9 months worth of electricity usage. I am now in debt as a result of this bill, do they care, fcuk no.I will consider legal action against they, they provide dishonest service, send meter readers who don't know how to read meters, so watch out for that one. The joke is on British people for allowing the French to fcuk them, myself included, but not anymore"
5712|"I've written some pretty brutally honest reviews on here, mainly for ""Spark Energy"", another electricity supplier who are an absoloutely awful company. I have also been with Npower previously who I found to be too pricey.. EDF was by far the best price for our two bedroom flat.. The opening price was really good, and to be honest I thought that the good price probably wouldn't last and there would be a catch somewhere, but in fact my bills have decreased from the original price I was paying. This is probably because its so easy to submit meter readings online, and your bill is adjusted accordingly.. I really like that you have a copy of your bill to download on your account aswell, I find the bills make sense and are easy to understand.. Some companies seem to like to make the bills look so much more complicated than they need to be, probably to put customers off even looking in to what they're paying at all. You can also see exactly how much you are in credit.There was also a problem with my gas meter reading when I switched from Npower; EDF emailed and wrote to me to say that this was something they were looking into and that it would be resolved as soon as possible. They let me know that they would still be taking payment each month whilst the issue was being resolved, so that I didn't suddenly end up with a large bill some day. I thought it was excellent to do that, and a lot more courteous than most energy companies..I can see from the reveiws on here that there seems to be issues on the phone, long waiting times, or being cut off. That is extremely annoying but its not something I've dealt with as I do everything online..Hopefully EDF keep it up because I have had no problem with them at all so far... And no I'm not from EDF ha ha, I am a genuine customer :)"
5713|I am having as new consumer unit installed by my electrician. In order to complete this job safely I need an isolator switch placed between the meter and CU. This is so that he can fit new cables into the CU which comply with modern safety standard. It has taken me a day and a half to hopefully find out how to get this job done. I waited two hours for my call to customer services to be answered, they referred me to an incorrect company. I have since been passed from pillar to post, including being advised to phone two other organisation who could not help me. Finally I spoke to Rena in Liason at EDF. She took my number and details and went to the trouble of sorting out who I needed to speak to. She went further by obtaining two possible dates for the work to be carried out on. Overall I cannot recommend EDF. Although evidently they do have at least one employee who can be bothered. My advice to any EDF customer is to avoid customer service and go to Liason. If this fails ask to be put through to a supervisor. To EDF I would say promote Rena because she is the only one who could be bothered to sort the matter out for me.
5714|To - Steve Hayfield - Customer Services Director. I'm at a loss. You provide no 'services'. I've just moved into new premises and EDF was original supplier. So i rang to re-connect. And rang. And rang. And rang over a seven day period. Each time waiting at least 6/8 minutes - just now (4th Sept - 17.52pm) lasted 7.43 seconds. And guess what? Spoke to nobody.Come Steve, take early retirement - EDF can afford it - you made GBP1.6billion...
5715|Trying many times to get through without success. Just going round in circles with their phone service suggesting various options. None of which are relevant. Really annoyed with this company and their attitude.
5716|EDF obviously have too many customers or not enough staff, why does it take so long to get through, it wouldnt be so bad if you knew where you were in the queue. All you get is some woman going on about how you can contact them on-line - but that doesn't work either, i just get a message saying my password is not recognised. (and yes, i am definatley putting in the correct password) i'm FURIOUS - this kind of lackadasical service in pathetic.
5717|Switching to EDF was the worst decision i have made this year, have had nothing but trouble from the first week i switched to them. They don't answer the phone when you call the call centre, when you finally get though over 40 minutes later if you have the patience to wait that long, their systems are down, someone will call you back, no they can't tell you when and they never call you back or they say they have fixed the problem, a month down the line and i found out they never actually fixed it all and didn't bother telling me. I switched from pre-payment to the stanard meter and after asking them to set me up on a monthly plan i STILL haven't recieved a bill from them 2 months later and found out that it's because the advisor i spoke to didn't set it up in the first and my bill STILL isn't ready! As soon as they send me bill, i'm paying it and switching back to my old supplier. 
5718|This is the worst company in the UK. 40 mins to get through to the call centre and then the agent said he had set up my direct debit and didnt. I then spoke to their live chat team oh they are based in India and do not comprehend what you are trying to convey to them, all they say is sorry I am following rules. There is no wonder EDF energy have to tempt people with fixed prices because if it was on customer service this company propably would not exist. This is the worst decision I have ever made to swap suppliers and will be changing back to my old supplier as soon as it goes through. PLEASE PEOPLE FOR YOUR SANITY STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS COWBOY FIRM
5719|"EDF!! My god I need help getting through to these people! I've spoken to them so many times, also getting people's names and dates when I've spoken to them inc times but they then tell me I was given the wrong information?!? I was getting bills saying I owe GBP90-GBP100 then the following bill was GBP600cr (does this mean I was in credit??) the following bill said I owe GBP800+ I called and asked why? I was told it was a miss print! I then receive yet another bill for GBP800+ and they just took it out of my bank when I got through after 50 mins she told me I wouldn't of been told it was a miss print and I did have bills warning me I'd have to pay it I said I thought you'd got it wrong AGAIN she said no we dont miss print! so when I looked closely at my energy use chart it had gone up from a 2.0 usage to a whooping 30.0???? ""I"" had to point this out then she asked for a reading "" oh they got the reading wrong when they came out to read it!!!"" I was NOT happy so i had to do an indemnity claim and got it all back! I was then told I owed just GBP181 so thought fine I will pay that (baring in mind I pay DD and pay for what I use?) I thought I'd paid It but my bill still came in at GBP300+?? When I called yet again I was told I was given wrong info I am sooo angry and don't know what or who to talk to I've got ALL bills that don't add up but they don't seem to listen to me. Please can anyone tell me who I can speak to about my bills as they are so confusing since they messed it up and I feel like I'm paying more than I should be?! "
5720|Do not use this company.  The so-called customer service, if you can get through, is shocking. We are moving as soon as possible. We stayed with them because SWEB provided a good service.  EDF are completely different or rather indifferent and not only unhelpful in sorting out problems of their own making, but even worse, they are ignorant of their own systems.
5721|Moved to these, as they promised me a good deal. first year no bills, but 2 accounts,  when i called them they said i didnt need to pay a bill, as i was in credit,  this was worrying as I knew my 1/4 bill was due. Turns out they completely messed up deleted one account then 12 months after my last payment they sent me a bill for GBP800 with only 4 days to pay, and no warning. I sorted this out, and told them i couldnt pay that much in one go, and thought it was extreme. actually amount should have been GBP560, but they over estimated.  Then agreed I could pay this off monthly as it was their mistake.Today I have recieved a Bill for GBP750 (which includes my new bill )  for the total amount owing, asking for the full sum of money within a week.  In the same post I have a letter saying they are sending me for court proceeding for non payment,  these are dated 4 days apart and the court order is issued before the bill is!!!!!  have been on hold for 53 minutes so far waiting to talk to them, and cant get through. DO NOT SIGN UP TO THEM!
5722|We joined EDF on their blue tariff fixed until 2014 which seemed like a really good deal at the time.  I only realised something was wrong when they took (without telling me) nearly GBP500 from my bank account this month.When I rang up to query this they told me that they hadn't been charging me for gas so they were back-dating my charges.  When I challenged them on why they hadn't charged me for gas as I gave them a meter reading when I changed supplier as I did with the electricity, they told me that it was the wrong kind of reading.This was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard and they said that as I was paying by monthly direct debit it wouldn't pick up on any problems for a year.I sent an email to the Customer Services Director to complain about the service and nearly 3 weeks later I've not heard a thing.  Apparently  (which I now truly believe) EDF have the worst record for customer complaints.Don't go anywhere near EDF as you really can't trust them.  I am now in the process of switching suppliers.  
5723|Edf energy are just scammers out to make money . They will not even let me pay my bill. I tred online to be told my surname is invalid. On the phone automated service I have been cut off after entering card details three times. When trying speak to Advisor I was on hold for 30mins and then cut off. When I complained I was emailed to go to the post office! 
5724|EDF advised in 2011 to improve service gas and electric bill would be combined. Despite receiving a bill in May, received a bill today with a charge of GBP660 for electricity from Nov 2011. Apparently EDF had not had a meter reading (I am sure I sent one) so not bothered to charge me. When I asked why they had not let me know apparently they don't. EDF don't do common courtesy.Steve Hayfield wrote to me, but I was advised as it was 7 pm he'll have gone home by now. They do have a procedure for complaints. I explained so did I, I speak to the Customer Services Director. Apparently I have to abide by their procedure not mine!!!Fortunately I was kept waiting for ten mins so I had time to go on USwitch. Scottish Power can save me GBP200 pa! Farewell Steve Hadfield and EDF!!! 
5725|I have tried to contact this company by 'phone with regard to two separate incidents a few months apart. The first was for them screwing up my bank transfer (the only company that did) the second was for a bill which any cursory glance would have shown to be incorrect.It was the same both times, endlessly waiting on the end of a 'phone that's never answered with the same music and repeated statement over and over. So in the end you email them and you get a response saying thank you, we will get back to you within 10 days. 10 days? Are you serious?Like most companies, as long as you don't have a problem then it's fine. If you get a problem, well, good luck.
5726|"They never managed to get a bill correct, if you phone them they promise to look into the matter and call back, but they never do. Their computer systems can't even do a simple vat calculation properly, and they keep you holding on the phone forever. Trying to speak to the same person twice is a real challenge as they seem to constantly disappear onto ""training courses"".p.s. the training courses don't seem to be working!I wouldn't recommend them to a friend, an enemy perhaps!"
5727|Don't EVER switch to these turkeys. They make it almost impossible to pay your bill.By phone you are confronted by the WORST voice recognition software imaginable. I stated seventy seven pounds to be asked to confirm if I wanted to pay GBP8192.16. I mean WTF?So you go on hold. For ever. And I mean 45 minutes+ with the same hold music track over and over. There is an online service to pay but the registration for that is similarly broken. I just gave up.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. MUPPETS!!
5728|I have recently changed my electricty supply to EDF Blue Price Promice September 2013 and was the cheapest fixed rate deal on the market at the time of me switching. I have contacted them by telephone a few times to enquire about my switch and they seem to be polite and ok to deal with. However, they are slow at answering the telephone which is anoying.  Looking at other what other people have said I just wonder if EDF was the right choice. So far so good anyway.  
5729|Ive been with them for 5 years, most of the received bills were incorrect! E.g.once I received a quaterly bill for more than GBP7000 which was obviously wrong and it took me a year to finally sort it out with them. They were sending me 'amended' bills for GBP6000 and then for about GBP3000 while it should have been circa GBP150!! So I stopped paying for a while until it would be sorted and they sent a guy to cut the electricity off..Absolutely hopeless!!!Customer service people very friendly but I didnt get much of a help from them.Forget about saving money too!!
5730|I WILL NEVER USE EDF AGAIN, THEY TOOK GBP700 OUT IN ONE MONTH, NO NOTICE AND FORCED ME IN TO FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. THEIR STAFF WERE OBSTRUCTIVE AND RUDE, YOU HAVE TO FORCE THEM TO SPEAK TO ANYONE IN POSITION, EVEN THEN THEY ARGUE. TWO FULL DAYS OF BEING STREESED AND NOT EVEN AN APOLOGHY, SHOCKING CARE.MY ADVICE, AOVID, NOT FRIENDLY OR HELPFUL, RUDE. CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE LENGHTY COMPLAINTS PROCESS AFTER SEEKING ADVICE FROM OMBUDSMAN. NEVER IN 20 YEAR HAVE I HAD SUCH RUDENESS, DEFENSIVE LIES
5731|I have been with E.D.F.for ten months,I have had three account numbers,and even though I pay by Direct Debit and am in credit they still keep upping my payments without warning I have had thirty six e mails from them in ten months and am looking foreward to ending my contract with them in two months.Worrying thing is though they are going to run our nuclear supplies,steer well clear of this company,you have been warned. 
5732|one of the tricky company in uk and expensive i didnt make contract because i found %40 cheaper
5733|This time I was only on hold for 15 minutes, the last time I rang (three weeks ago) I was on hold for 30 minutes while they answered the call and then promptly cut me off.  I take issue with the fact that when I cancelled my account, they were very quick to send a brochure to my new address detailing how I could change my supplier.  A week later, I had my final bill telling me that I was GBP200 in credit with no additional information about how I would be refunded the money.  I waited another week before calling them to find out what was happening (giving them the benefit of the doubt that they were busily processing my refund) and may still have to wait ten days before the money is refunded to my account (best case scenario - they are calling me back this time).What possessed the customer services team to think that listening to the instrumental version of Take on Me on a constant loop would be a good idea?  Also, being told every 10 seconds that I can do these things on-line is not helpful given that I clearly want to talk to someone.
5734|"I first signed upto EDF energy as they seemed cheapest in my area, what a mistake that was. Shortly after moving to EDF I had a new electric meter fitted by my old company Scottish Power (whom I had no problems by the way) I informed EDF of the new meter and final readings for my old meter etc however 10 months later I am still unable to enter meter readings online as it still has my old meter on their system. I have written several emails to customer service as I am unable to get through on the phone as the long waiting times put me off. They keep saying that they will rectify it asap but nothing ever gets done. Even the meter reading man said ""I can't take your electric readings as the worng meter is on the system"". Once my contract finishes in November I am going back with Scottish Power at least they seem to know what their doing and the online system is streaks ahead. Also even though on uswitch it said I would be saving around GBP200 / year I am now paying more than I was previously.Thinking of going with EDF?? DON'T BOTHER!!"
5735|If they can't work out my electricity and gas bill after 10 months God help us when they start running nuclear power stations!
5736|Evidently they don't want to speak to their customers, regardless of time of day. 
5737|I was with EDF for a year in a student house. I had to make multiple phonecalls (including 10+ minute hold times) to get switched to quarterly billing from monthly billing. I say multiple because after the initial set-up I still got monthly bills through. The people at EDF are complete slaves to their computer system as they could not simply change my account to quarterly like I had asked them to, it required putting the old (mistaken monthly) bills on hold; which I'm sure has affected my credit rating in some way. They also once sent bailiffs (a company called PDP services, from Oxfordshire. Seemed a bit of a waste as I was living in Leeds) after me even though the bill was not due for another week and I had paid the bill the day before they came! I am now dealing with paying my final bill and it seems EDF have added an extra GBP36 on top of my bill with no explanation on my account. So now I am making another 10+ min call (my second of the day) to get this charge explained to me. Do not give these vultures any of your money.
5738|I have been a customer of EDF for the last 2+ years and the service has not been a service. Like every other honest customer I have paid direct debit month on month and stayed within the written agreement received from EDF at the beginning of the service. My word what a fiasco this has become.The promise from EDF to me (in contractural writing) was as a customer they would twice yearly monitor my usage and amend accordingly with my payments adjusted. This did not happen and even readings submitted not logged as A (actual) but E. EDF even sent me an estimated bill for usage for 2012 on E. My final bills for usage from EDF equated to over GBP1000, this not due to any over usage on my part but a total mis-management of my Account or neglect of my Account by EDF. When you try to phone EDF you are kept waiting for up to half an hour therefore, I recommend chat, where the the call centre operatives in India give you totally misinformed information to what they tell you in the UK call centres. I have sent many a lunchtime and evening trying to get firstly a contact then common sense out of the centre operatives, informing of my Issue over and over again, absolutely laughable service!! After viewing the large bills I discovered that EDF were in were infact charging me twice for my Electricity which was included also within the Gas final bill. I was told by a call centre operative that I was not reading the overcharge correctly and my complaint appeared to be because I had a high final bill, well yes, nothing to do with the lack of real honest customer service or was it to the fact that I actually pointed the duplication of overcharge out? My personal view is EDF provide a service of where their expertise should lie, nothing diverse, energy and bills therefore, why have I left this organisation feeling as if I have been scammed by a bunch of cowboys. My advice the smaller the organisation the better the service. EDF are not been publicised too much at present for their awful service because of the current sponsorship and links to the Olympics. Once this is over hopefully for the general public who are experiencing these rip off merchants the s... may hit the fan. Maybe Central Government might sit up and realise what a lousy service the public are receiving from EDF and the hones are taking to long to be answered because of the number of complaints being received. I took my bills into work the other day to share with colleagues and amazingly two fellow workers were also having great difficulties with EDF...Well what a surprise? A word of advice, avoid like the plague.  
5739|I moved into a new flat with my partner, on the day i moved in i was told the electricity was supplied by EDF. they looked the best value for money so decided to stay with them. I immediately tried to get in touch and spent 1.30 hours on the online the chat without getting anywhere. they cut me off 4 times! i ended up going through as new customer a week later. called when they send me letter stating they needed more info, i gave then meter reading and they said that it will be a tenant switch and all will go through now. 2 weeks later a bill came through for old tenant passed it back and called to see where my bill was had been in property over 1 month... they hadnt set me up properly and now i was in arrears! am paying first bill and switching asap. very poor customer service.
5740|I have had a similar experience as some of you out there. I transferred my gas and electricity supplier to EDF in September. I managed to get an Electricity account set up which means I can enter my electricity meter readings and also view my quarterly electricity bill. However, after 9 months of phone calls, emails and more phone calls I still don't have a Gas account.The latest cock-up is that I emailed their customer service department which included the following...............'I hope this will help to clarify matters for you however please feel free to contact me if you should wish to query or discuss anything further on our free phone number 0800 096 101 9000'.When I dialled the free phone number it was e-On!. In disbelief I tried it again - and yes it was definitely e-On (their competitor). I have just received an apologetic email from EDF.  Can someone explain why Customer Complaints at EDF gave me the telephone number for their competitor????????????
5741|Quite frankly EDF are pants. We have to beg them for a bill, perhaps they just don't like billing people or its due to the fact that they are incredibly unprofessional. A lovely lady there helped solve a query earlier this year after her collegue nearly had a nervous breakdown when I demanded a bill and threatened to change suppliers. We thought it was just a glitch, but noooooo, history seems to be repeating itself.A rather disgruntled fan of the little dancing poo....
5742|It takes the call centers forever to answer the phone,if a manager gives you their direct phone number ,you cant get through.has taken me a year to get my account updated so i can pay for gas and electric,pay by direct debit and built up almost GBP500,recieve a call to say account updated and charged for power and gas to april ,left with GBP119 in the account,supplied new meter readings and asked to be billed from april to present,cant do that till monday because can only raise one invoice a day per account.Log in to my  account on their  website,account balance should read GBP119 cr now reads GBP913 .00 cr.EDF YOU REALLY ARE A BUNCH OF CLOWNS.
5743|I'm not gonna go into detail here my problems coz its not gonna get me anywhere but I am appalled at the level of incompetence of the staff at EDF! And NO ONE ANSWERS THE FREAKING PHONES! You think your gonna take money out of my account at an address I don't live at anymore and that I have paid upto and including my final so much so I was in credit and you paid me! That was January I owe nothing now but today apparently I owe you GBP143 for a final bill from the house I moved out of in January it's now nearly July! SICK of it goingelsewhere.com 
5744|OK, so I like Monty Python. Is that a crime? EDF is French and it certainly has some quaint 19th century French ways. Their website for starters. It was nearly a year before I was able to access and input my meter readings. (I think the CEO's grandmother was upgrading the site) The industrial side of EDF sweats to produce the energy... all the blunt end had to do was handle the admin. It's not rocket science. I paid by direct debit They were FOREVER taking the money out late (it mucks yer monthly fiscal planning system up doesn't it?)  I changed to The Co-op during 38 Degree's Big Switch (an ethical BRITISH company....not many of those left are there?) Their website? 21st Century and then some. A reduced gas/electricity quote I get Co-op points (EDF abandoned Nectar points) An all round better option. Plus, they NEVER smell of elderberries
5745|My God what a bunch of incompetent idiots.  My Electricity Meter broke back in Dec 11 and was reported to them immediately.  The earliest they were able to arrange a fitter to replace the meter was end of Feb 12 !!   Meter was eventually replaced.   It is now middle of June 12 and they have still not updated my account with the new meter details and therefore been unable to supply correct meter readings.I have complained to them several times and today received a response advising that as they are taking so long to investigate I can refer them to OFGEM.I have since transferred to a new provider however yes another balls up!  The new provider has given them final readings however EDF advise these are wrong as they don't match previous readings submitted to them!  Well of course they won't the meter has been changed.Now been on the phone for 40 minutes and not spoken to an AgentAbsolutely shocking service.   Don't touch them with a Barge Pole
5746|I have been an EDF customer for approximately 9 months. Soon after joining EDF I moved banks. EDF were the only company that failed to move direct debits from my old bank to the new bank. As a result I had to catch up 3 months of bills in one month. Over this period I contacted EDF several times asking why they had not taken funds...No reply. I have called many times and I just end up waiting for 20-30 min +. They are simply useless
5747|Since joining EDF 3 years ago I have had nothing but problems. One of the main problems was being badgered to change over onto a monthly direct debit of GBP70. I had no need for this as my average 2 winter bill for gas and electricity were GBP130 (for both) and 2 in the summer for GBP60 so no neeed there. After refusing to switch last year our billing seemed distant and started causing problems in March of this year we were GBP120 in credit with EDF now in May we owe GBP700. ue to their system problems. I am now expected to pay GBP120 a month direct debit. Shows that they managed to get me on it in the end. Total rubbis avoid at all costs 
5748|"Assurance, ""sir you only need to pay GBP55 PM"". (I argued for GBP75, when i joined in September)Now i need to pay twice the amount (GBP115, they wanted GBP145) to put it right (without a cleared balance they would not release me from the contract....balance due Is because of their errors). Will soon be changing, but ""owe them GBP250.00""I say take GBP115 PM, so they agree to take this.... what do they take....GBP76This was a disaster to change to themIf my work quality was like this, i'd be handed a P45, and rightly so...I'd love them to allow a change of supplier, following the meter reading, and ""only pay the monthly DD, they can pay the rest"
5749|Fortunately I was only with EDF for about 5 weeks whilst looking after an empty property. In the 5 weeks I only used 49 pence worth of electricity. I was eventually sent a bill for GBP12.99. This was made up of the 49 pence plus GBP12.50 in standing charges.EDF made no attempt at all to tell me that the account would include standing charges. So as far as I am concerned they have obtained this money from me by deception.I phoned to complain. Over 16 minutes to answer the call.A 'manager' called Anthony Taylor phoned me back. He was officious, unsympathetic, repeatedly pronounced my surname incorrectly and even brought the subject of my tax returns into the conversation! Totally unprofessional.I emailed the customer services director at customerservicesdirector@edfenergy.com. I might as well not have bothered. I only got an apology from EDF when I pointed out that they hadn't bothered to give me one.Again, totally unsympathetic and totally uninterested in my concerns.EDF = Extremely Deceptive Frenchelectricitycompany
5750|avoid this company at all costs - you have been warned. Ignore this warning and you too will be posting on this site in due course to warn others
5751|Working for EDF energy is a stressful experience! Appalling billing system that does unpredictable inexplicable things which are impossible to explain to an understandably annoyed customer. The new system is horrendous and  causes so many complaints. Basic tasks like issuing a refund are nightmares and you can never trust it will work despite promising it to the customer. I'm sure we all want to do a good job but do not have the tools to . It's so frustrating and disheartening.  The products are good value- such as the new Blue tariff but the system is awful. It is so complicated to even work out an account balance. There is also talk of staff reductions this year when the company can't even cope with the current call volumes. And there is no point escalating complaints to the MD mailbox as they are just passed back to team managers to answer with the help of their CSA's (us) that answer the phones in the first place. There is no time to follow up on calls and have even heard managers say to their teams  not to bother but to take another call, so nothing gets done. EDF was a good company to work for and to be a customer of until the introduction of SAP but now it's an embarassment. I certainly wouldn't be a customer if I couldn't monitor my own account to ensure my DD does not collect some random amount un-notified. I still have some optimism that things may improve otherwise I will be abandoning ship before it sinks. 
5752|We are moving beacuse their billing system is awful and their customer service is worse - normal wait time is 45 mins + We have been trying to close our account since Feb - they can't even manage that !Should this company have their licence removed ?
5753|Staff are very rude. Would not recommend them as an energy supplier.
5754|EDF have no customer service at all. Phone calls are put on hold for a long time and then comes the message please call back all operators are busy?. If and when you get through(takes great persistence)you are told (and since April 2011) that they are short staff due to training staff on new system!(must be one hell of a system)I tried Email, got auto response they would reply in 10 days.(email was not full of long words).email 1 got reply 20 days later and gave information that had nothing to do with my enquiry.tried again. Same rubbish answer to email 2.Latest email sent 15.4.12 now 26.4.12 regarding Feed in Tarrif application.Again no reply in 10 days.I am on tariff which expires Sept 12 and I will be moving suppliers without a doubt.It amazes me that EDF cant employ staff to sort out customer service and why does the regulator allow this to go on. No I think everybody knows the answer 
5755|We've been with EDF for over 2 years and have been unable top leave due to being in debit with them. However if EDF would actually listen to their customers this would never have happened metre readings are ignored, phone calls are never returned despite being being told they'll phone back in so many days, They've taken money from our bank account illegally more than GBP500 a week before christmas (luckily the bank was able to get this all back). There is a distinct lack of correspondence from them. We've now refused to continue paying and the fight continues.Like I said avoid avoid avoid
5756|I had been with EDF since I purchased my house some four years ago and have no complaints about that service whatsoever.  What stunned me was after switching to an alternative supplier who could provide a service if only pence cheaper, I was amazed to get a final bill from EDF showing that I owed them GBP143!  When you consider that I'm on a prepayment meter, I couldn't understand how I could owe them anything!  After ringing them, and spending some 12 to 15 minutes on their hold line, was told that this was an error in the final reading!  What final reading?  I'm on prepay!  Admittedly the lady on the phone was very helpful and said she would sort the problem out, but what would happen if an elderly person received such a bill?  They would probably think they should pay it.
5757|Ok im new to EDF, had it now for 4 months but already im realising how poor the system is. The submit meter reading interface never works for me and logging in using my password was extremely glitchy for weeks. Whats the point if people like British Gas are light years ahead of you??
5758|"Being a disabled customer I moved on the ""Priority"" service, what a complete joke. Having been a good customer for years they just decided to change my payment plan from quarterly to 6 monthly without the common decency to even inform me. Four days of (expensive) phone calls later not one phone monkey could explain to me why this had happened.This action has now left me in fuel poverty as I have a fixed income and yet this seems to mean nothing to them.I am supposed to get my meters read, being disabled, not once have they ever been read. Instead EDF continually send me estimated bills so I have to provide my own readings.Do yourself a BIG favour, if like me you are on a fixed income DO NOT entertain these jokers. You have been warned."
5759|We stupidly moved from Scottish Power to EDF in Dec 2010.Price was great for dual fuel.But, since about 3 months into our account with EDF, they cannot show me my electricity bill.I can see my gas bill, I do pay my bills on time by DD each month but, the small issue of seeing my electricity bill stumps them completely.I've now had at least six emails apologising and stating IT issues.If that was my IT dept. I'd be worried, very worried.Don't touch this company with a bargepole.Peter
5760|It's fair to say EDF Energy did not have a good year in 2011 with their new system being put in place at the beginning of the year and migrating millions of customers from the old system to the new system - things are bound to go up and down. Problems such as no gas bill produced, incorrect direct debit review adjustments, delay in meter exchange updates and long que waiting times being the main cause of complaints. EDF Energy recognise these issues and are addressing them. I work for EDF Energy and I'm not being bias as I work behind the scenes - I know exactly what goes on.  I agree we have not had a good year as most of the reviews on here are stating how awful we have been as a company. However we are getting better, system issues are less now than they've ever been, a dedicated team are working hard to fix those accounts with gas billing problems and direct debit review adjustments are being looked into as are other common issues we are experiencing at the moment. It is a temporary fault and if you could see the advisors working behind the scenes, you would realise we are doing the best we possibly can to help every customer as much as possible. We've launched a new one of a kind tariff - the blue tariff.. where we let customers know if they could save money with another supplier and if this is the case, we'll let you transfer without any termination fee's. We want people to start trusting us and if you can give us a chance and find out yourself, you will see just how dedicated our customer services team are to go that extra mile for you. I'm just a customer service advisor working for EDF Energy and i KNOW what goes on behind the scenes, we do care and we do want to offer you the cheapest best deals going - give us a chance and you won't regret it. 
5761|"I worked for EDF for over 2 years and all I can say it is mickey mouse operation ran by people who have no managerial education or training.  The management either sit around talking to each other or hounding the staff if they leave their seats for a toilet break.  The phrase ""where have you been"" was often heard by the so-called management if you were not available to take another call for 15 seconds.EDF do not allow the staff to have ""fixed"" breaks  the staff don't have a fixed morning or afternoon break, however this two bit company get round this by saying you are free to get up use the toilet and get a drink any time you like, however and it is a big however! if you leave you seat for more than 2 mins you have the management chasing you demanding to know where you have been, once explained you have been for a drink they insist you get back to take another call from the 100's of disgruntled unhappy and generally badly treated customers!"
5762|Having joined EDF in august last year I became concerned i had not received a gas bill and so I e mailed the company who apologised and said they would rectify the problem , this has been going on now 6 months and i still have no clue at all how much our gas bill will be or how many units ive used etc and yes I do know i can work it out but to be frank why the hell should I !!! I pay by DD and expect a blinking Bill !!!. I cant leave they informed me because im tied in and yet they don't seem to have to honour their side of the bargain by giving me quarterly bills !!! Customer Service is non existent and i have contacted the ombudsman . They really are a useless bunch !
5763|"Had my 2 business accounts with EDF for some time now. Always paid once an invoice was received.Today i got a letter saying i had not paid one invoice or supplied a meter reading as per a letter that was supposed to have been sent 3 weeks ago. I have not had such a letter.Also i have had no letter for my 2nd account, which invoice dates are always the same as each other.I rang them (usuall we are changing systems over, telling my how wonderfull they are and recruiting extra staff then telling me i could have a long wait)Finally got through to someone, told him about the letter i had received and was told they have a new system installed and can no longer sent out invoices for estimated readings. I said how can i pay you then when i dont receive any invoice and he told me the last letter send 8th march asked for my readings and now as they had not received any, they did an estimated costing which counters why they said they dont sent them.Anyhow told him ill pay online.Then asked him why i had not received a letter for my 2nd account. I was told thats because they were able to read that meter. I said how can they read 1 and not the other as next to each other. I was then told a balance is outstanding and when asked when the invoice was sent out i was told 2nd March. So thats another item that they have said they have sent i have not received. Either Royal Mail are doing thier usual bang on job or they have not sent it.Anyhow, told him ill pay both online but told that could be an issue as can only register an email address once and i have 2 accounts. Also told i must register name exactly as it is on the bill, case sensitive or it wont work. And they call this ""upgrading thier systems"". 1980's stuff tbh. Anyhow registered twice, using 2 different mail address's, and after sending payment, which had abit of a lengthy wait to clear, more so than any other online payments ive done, it seems both accounts are now upto date but im missing 2 invoices for VAT as online syste, says no invoices on account?????Complete shambles, i shall be switching providers this week"
5764|I changed to edf in September last year and am still trying to get a bill out of them to pay. All they have done so far is cancelled my dd after paying me GBP180.I do not want a huge bill at once and I want to know what my charges are. Getting through to them is hopeless, and when you do all you get is a load of promises that are never kept.Are these really the people we want to run our Nuclear power stations. Definately not, and I would urge you all to write to your MP's to make sure they don't.
5765|Have been trying to get through to customer service in order to close down my account. Tried calling them on the weekend without getting through at all since the wait was so long. Now I am instead stuck with waiting about 15 minutes, getting through only to have my call go directly to a busy tone. This has happened three times now. 
5766|I recently left EDF Energy after 20 years of service due to the sub-standard service given to the customers of which I was not happy to give. The training we were recently given for the new computer system was out of date and the 'promised' support once we were trained was non-existent and the managers not fit for purpose. The long-term sickness levels of their staff are appalling and really need to be addressed and not ignored as they seem to be doing. The way they treat their staff is disgraceful especially with the constant untruths being fed to keep the staff, many of which are long-term. It is shameful that this has been allowed to go on for so long - wouldn't recommend them in a million years.
5767|I have been charged for the last 10th months for the wrong meter. they keep sending me bills for a meter that is not installed at home and that is about 1,000 more than mine. I have called, wrote, etc I infom them repeteatly of the right reading and my meter number and nothing!! They even send me a threatening letter to go to court because I refusing to pay someone else meter.7 emails , 4 calls...Letter to the Steve Hayfield Customer Services Director and nothing...
5768|I worry about losing my job because our new system is that bad I fear we will lose our licence to bill Electric & Gas! It is truly unbelievable how bad our daily work now is.They dont seem to be addressing the problems we are facing and the direction from the top is atrocious. 
5769|Do not join EDF Energy, their whole system is a disgrace. They recently implemented a new system which they are moving users on to gradually, however this has so many issues leaving many customers accounts with problems which no one knows how to fix. Customers who make complaints expecting resolutions to their problems rarely get them looked in to, and even if they do get their complaint escalated to managing director level a MD doesn't even deal with it.. one of their lowsy bad tempered managers will who will fob you off with a good will payment.
5770|"I used EDF in my old flat for 2 and a half years and never had any problems.  Moving out in February however has caused no end of crap. I rang to let them know my moving out date, gave final meter readings for gas and electric and they assured me my direct debits would be cancelled and final bills sent.  To my surprise, they took GBP90 from my account AFTER I had moved out, and then proceeded to send me 4 separate statements in the post, one saying I was GBP43 in credit, another saying I was GBP59 in credit, another saying I owed them GBP29, and the latest one tells me I owe them GBP185!  I have repeatedly called customer service this last month asking when they are going to credit my account with the GBP43 and then the GBP59, I paid the GBP29 as requested but this latest bill takes the p*ss.  They also told me over the phone that the bill was estimated as I didn't provide meter readings!! I repeated the readings to them again and the operator said ""oh yeah, we do have them"".  So why send me an ESTIMATED bill, wtf is going on?!!  I'm currently awaiting a call back from them as they promised to ""look into"" the numerous conflicting letters I've received, but I don't expect anything, except perhaps MORE bills/statements which don't make sense... I can't believe how shockingly poor their customer service is, it seems to me that whatever I say when I ring up is not recorded anywhere and I have to explain everything all over again every time I speak to someone. Very disappointing indeed."
5771|Started contract with EDF 8 months ago. Their system still doesn't aknowledge that I have GAS.Customer service and resolution of problems are pathetic.
5772|My 88 year old mother was 'cold called' one early evening,(last March) - thought it was a meter reader,he persuaded her to change to EDF to save her money. By September, was getting very stressed, as had never received a bill, they were not taking enough to cover her gas bill, she had phoned to tell them to 'take more', made many calls, kept getting fobbed off with changing of their system, and they had not got her her final readings, so she phoned her previous supplier Southern Electric, who said they had given EDF final readings. My sister finally phoned and demaned to speak to 'someone' in authority. This person agreed mum had been very badly let down. November, finally received a bill. In the meantinme, she called Southern Electric again, they said she was still 'on their books' giving all her details, so she has now gone back to them. EDF's bill included a GBP25 penalty for cancelling their contract (a copy of which had not been left by agent). After more phone calls, the GBP25x2 (gas & elec) was cancelled, as a sign of goodwill!! Mum said,  at least with Southern, I get to spek to 'someone' immediately and problem solved.  
5773|Logged into account on 24 Jan to submit a reading and looked at the current bill to check balances. It showed there that EDF were planning to take GBP2960 punds for electricity and GBP20 for gas on  1 Feb, which was a shock it normally was GBP60 pounds combined. Immediately called them up and they said they would change it at once, customer service advisor stated they were having many billing issues of late due to new system. Called the next day to ensure that it was all in order and was told that the DD was amended to 8 Feb as it was too late to change the 1 Feb payment, but would be changed back from 1 March. Recevied a letter from their customer services director confirming this. 1 Feb comes and EDF take GBP3000 from my account, mortgage payment and other DD gets rejected because of this. Whatever is going on with their systems it is far too risky to continue with DD even though it saves GBP90 per year, and I will be moving to ather provide asap.
5774|"Anyone who's giving this lot a decent rating must be on a completely different planet...1. Website - doesn't work. Can't enter meter readings on it - useless.2. Phone response - be prepared to wait, wait, wait, then wait a lot more (whilst listening to how you always seem to have called at a particularly busy time and being urged to use the website - return to number 1 - which, remember, doesn't work. Once got through after waiting for an hour, only to be cut-off. It's so bad, it's just as if they're taking the p*ss - infuriating and depressing, all at the same time.What works well? Getting through to the top guy (whilst copying in Ofgem / Minister for Energy / MP / anyone with potential 'clout' that I could think of) won't give his name here, but easy to work out who, and worked out his email address too - delivers instant action, direct call-backs from person with nice job title who was obviously part of the 'executive-level mopping-up squad for customers who'd, unfortunately, managed to communicate with them'. Interesting how they admit that they can't copy / \""hundreds of new people being taken on to turn it around\"" etc. Honesty yes, but doesn't make up for total incompetence. Energy provider? I'd rather rub sticks together every night and start camp fires. Shouldn't be in business."
5775|There is nothing I like about EDF energy. The customer service department is useless as they can only deal with the simplest of things. I  have spent hours on the phone stating my problems to numerous people as each time you get a different person on the end of the line. Trying to get to speak to a supervisor is almost impossible and because they work at different sites they can only be contacted by e-mail, your call cannot be transferred. I have at last got an extension number and e-mail address of a supervisor who has sorted some of the problems out but many are still ongoing. We speak on the phone sort the problem out, but then the letter they send to confirm this is completely wrong. I was overcharged by GBP300 and it took ages getting the money back. I would be promised a refund and then the cheque never arrived. The bills need to be checked very carefully as they are always wrong and always in EDF's favour. Direct debits go out willy nilly. I had two in the same month on consecutive days.We transferred to EDF in January 2011 and our electricity account has still not been set up which means we will get a bill for over a years supply of electricity.We will be changing to another supplier in March at the end of our contract.MY ADVICE IS GIVE EDF A WIDE BERTH.  
5776|i,ve been with them for nearly 4yrs and nothing more than a knightmare, with never ending of mistake billing considering i,m using prepaid meter.Very poor service.very frustrarting dealing with.currently have 2 seperate complaints outstanding i can,t wait to see the back of them horrible company. 
5777|Despite having acredit on my account, They go one way only and that is up! This is truly a horrible organisation in every respect and i am counting down the days for my fixed contract to end. I would happily pay more for my energy to get the service i need...which is to pay for the energy i use each month without their patronising  direct debit reviews which merely builds up their own cash reserves.  My blood is boiling just thinking about this company. Lies and cheats from the first contact,i really dislike this company.
5778|I've been with EDF for gas & electricity since April 2010. The previous owner of the house used EDF and I thought it might be easier to continue with them.They then sent me the previous owners bills for the next 6 months....I had told EDF several times (in writing & by phone) that I now lived at the address.  They insisted on sending bills 'to the occupier' so I paid the previous owner's bills by mistake.I asked them to put the previous house owner's name on the bill - his bills would then be diverted to him. This seemed too complicated and I continued receiving the wrong bills for quite a while.It can take anything over 30 minutes to get through to the call centre. I've tried daytime and evening.  It is SO frustrating and I feel sorry for the call centre staff as customers must be livid by the time they get to speak to someone.I received a snotty red letter from them accusing me of not providing readings.  I had provided readings and they had acknowledged them(?!). Another 30 minutes on the phone and this was sorted but I was given 3 different bill amounts.....so have no idea what I'm supposed to be paying.I've looked on comparison sites and EDF appear to be the cheapest provider in my area.....so I need to stay with them a while longer.The customer service is poor. Calls are not answered and I continue to receive incorrect bills.  Not impressed.As soon as another company can compare on price I'm moving.
5779|I signed up for the 2014 fixed tariff Gas and electric when the option became available. The switch has taken longer than 6 months to activate, despite chasing (and  EDF already provided my Gas!)  So I have been on a standard tariff with EDF and my previous electricity provider for a very long time whilst waiting for the switch - very expensive!  (the 2014 tariff for gas provision should have been switched straight away surely, as they were already my supplier for gas?)Electricity switch went through on 15th Dec.  I received a bill for the period 15 - 31 Dec for electricity, and alongside it came a note stating my standard payments would increase to GBP203 !!!  However,  my monthly bill for dec  was GBP80 ?  why the huge increase ?Can I get hold of EDF on the phone?  I have tried several times over several days waiting in excess of 30 mins each time and given up !  Poor access via internet too.The transfer was not efficiently done and trying to get hold of customer service (a person to speak to!)  is a nightmare.  Direct debit has had to be cancelled!
5780|The problem with review sites is that the tend to be used to voice complaints, and not to show approval.I nearly by-passed EDF when I decided to change in September, but am pleased that I did not do so.The information provided regarding the change was helpful and accurate.The changeover was smooth and exactly as scheduled - compliments to both parties on this.Then I seemed to have a problem.My first account period involved the beginning of winter, and my first bill arrived indicating that my monthly payments would be increased as my usage appeared to be higher than predicted.This was, of course, because it had been a higher usage quarter, and the computer had re-assessed this as being indicative of the annual consumption.A phone call to a very pleasant and helpful member of staff confirmed this and an offer to return the Direct Debit to the originally agreed figure was immediately made, and accepted.A confirmatory email arrived overnight.If there is any adverse comment to be made, I suppose the computer might have been programmed to recognise that the quarter involved was not an average one, but life is never perfect.Otherwise I consider this to have been exceptionally good service.
5781|Switched through energyhelpline - or so I thought. EDF had no record of this and energyhelpline had to chase them with details of my application and find out the problem. Decided not to bother in the end as their service was so awful. Quickest time they answered the phone in was 13 minutes - and that was 2 o clock on a weekday.
5782|Been with EDF for 4 months. Communication, billing, information is NILL.
5783|"long telephone queue times - the company continually gives assurances that they are aware of the problem and are recruiting new staff but little improvement month on month.Complaint letter written to the company was partially answered. The company justified the poor customer service as being due to the unexpected demand for their ""market beating"" tariffs!Conclusion, doubt the competitors are much better but cannot be any worse"
5784|"I contacted this company to check my latest bill.  I was put on hold for what seems like forever.  The message, ""I'm sorry we're experiencing very high call volumes at the moment. If you would like to hold you will be connected as soon as an advisor becomes available""What a hopeless and pathetic message.  Clearly there are insufficient staff to answer the telephones!  Truly awful company.  Do what many other companies do and ring the customer back WHEN the advisor DOES become available."
5785|They consistently over-estimate their billing.  When my mother died in May, her house was largely unoccupied from June onwards.  Today I received a bill saying that 700 units of daytime electricty and 3320 units of night time electricity were estimated to be used between August and November.  Their estimates were overstated by 750 and 3500 respectively.  I'd already told EDF of the situation, so they have obviously just plucked these figures out of nowhere! I have spent a cumulative total of over 1 hour today waiting to speak to an operator when I called their queries number.Oh, and their customer contact web page is unavailable until 28th November because of 'planned maintenance'.If I worked for EDF I'd be hanging my head in shame.
5786|Became a customer back in Feb 2011 for electricity and in May decided to switch gas supply from BG as EDF had very nice offer. They failed to activate gas supply for four months (but charged me), could not and still can not explain what happened, can't figure out on what contract am I now, can't provide details of bills other than totals that change every week for no apparent reason (was GBP 39 two weeks ago, went up to GBP 149 last Friday and is now at GBP 132).Call centre has long, long, long waiting time and operators are absolutely useless, confusing and unreliable.They reply to email on average after two weeks and replies have nothing to do with queries (do they read emails? Don't think so).They do not reply to letters so don't waste money on that.Terrible, terrible terrible
5787|Have been with EDf for a few years now, Joined as British Gas prices were soaring and their customer service was poor. Believed the ads from EDF that they were committed to bringing prices down and concerned about the Environment  etc. also wanted to earn Nectar points. shortly after joining they put prices up and have continued to do so at least twice a year with less than a couple of weeks notice. The covering letter says they don't raise prices but they DO. They also discontiued the Nectar Scheme which has now gone to Guess who ? - British Gas lol. Just received nice expensive glossy card and plastic gold card from EDF can go on line each month and see what prize have won ( tickets for olympics, GBP10,000 energy home makeover ? ) no have two accounts and both prizes are a discounted membership to a restaurant scheme, ( what a surprise ).  Just waiting for final annual Bill then going to switch to another company, probably B G as they seem to be trying to improve their management.  Also the bills are very difficult to decipher, they give you pleanty of info how to do it until you get to the last bit where suddenly the price you have worked out gets another price added to it as the total charge but no indication of how that figure is reached. Could try ringing them to find out if I had an hour to waste hanging onto the phone and being charged premium rates for the experience of listening to their stories about queues and staff training. Anyone know of a half decent utilities company that makes a fair profit but doesn,t exploit
5788|I have never called them and spent less than 25 minutes in a call queue.I email them in but it takes them so long to respond I have to recap that I even contacted them. I keep getting told when I call 'we are recruiting new staff....'To be honest I am surprised they manage to keep their customers or maybe this is one of those things where you do not need to call up.In fairness to them, the staff are usually polite - if an when they answer.
5789|Use EDF at your peril...I am a pensioner in a 1 bed flat..I don't use a tumble dryer..have no hi.tech machines..I always turn off standby on my T.V...I turn off all sockets when not in use..I don't use a microwave...I use energy saving bulbs(joke in itself).I pay GBP35 per month direct debit....now I am being told I need to pay GBP65 per month..and that I owe GBP396.93........HOW CAN THIS BE...I checked to see if they took payment for the last 3 months..NO..WHY I DON'T KNOW!.I wanted a check done on my meter...anotherGBP35...I have now asked for a key meter(I had this before and wish i kept it)I used to payGBP10 a week on this........they are going to take GBP3 extra a week to pay off arrears...WHAT ARREARS...I am not very good at working these things out...so will have to pay........once this is paid i shall be leaving them..I can make no sense of what they are saying..CAN ANYONE?
5790|Changed over in January from EON as EDF were cheaper.  Wish I had not bothered, worst decision ever.  Changed to an online dual fuel account.  Electric changed overfine but the gas account has still not been sorted and we are now into the tenth month.  We have not received a gas bill and the gas account has not gone live as they put it.  Have sent emails, only one of these was answered.  Constantly ringing giving my gas readings and asking when it will be sorted and getting nowhere.  Sent a letter to Customer Services head office, over two months ago, no reply.  Have been told that they are supplying gas to us and on one occasion I was told that there are thousands of people in the same position as ourselves.  Why are they still advertising to take on new customers when they can't sort out the ones they have got already.  What doesn't make sense is that at no time have we had a letter of apology for the problem or had a written explanation. It is a though they are ignoring that a problem exists.    AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS.  
5791|They are just a mess! Everything they do is wrong, doesn't work and they never answer the phone to rectify the problem. Moved to British Gas as they answered the phone, set everything up quickly and correctly (so far atleast).Just to give you an idea. We moved into a new flat, rang them up, gave them the meter reading and they sent a bill with the wrong dates. Spent 30 minutes on hold trying to get through, changed the dates and got them to send it to the landlord (for the time we were not in the flat), they sent it to us. Now have another account number but can't log in online and when you ring them it takes half an hour to get through! Eventually get online billing set up after a long phone call. Get a letter through the door saying as we haven't given them a meter reading and therefore we have to pay 3 months up front (within 2 weeks). Then the next day get a letter saying we need to give them a meter reading to get our bill (all dated in that order so it's not the post). So we get threatened to pay because we haven't given them a meter reading and then we get the letter asking for the meter reading the next day! I decide to just make the payment (to shut them up) but the GBP75 bill we received isn't online, ring up and after half an hour of waiting I'm allowed the make the payment! For your own sake do not go with this company!!!
5792|Signed up on 22nd July, they have lost meter reading in system so gas accout still not sorted. They do not reply to emails of complaint, even when sent to the CEO's office.They really do not seem to care less, the only way to get a response is by phoning them which can take ages to get through, and when you ask to speak to the person you were dealing with you cannot get hold of them so you are back to square one.I would really have to advice anyone against dealing with this company as they are only good for making you lose your hair.
5793|Joined EDF from scottish power where other than the hike in price the service I received was second to none... easy access to my account, good overall view of my usage, great customer service all round..How very different with this bunch of clowns.Joined December last year, took until the following April before my lower fixed price tariff came into force as until both fuels come over your stuck with a different and higher price.I am still not on line with my account.They send an e mail for a reading of my still seperate accounts for gas and electricity, then a week later send me another for my gas again!! One month they miss taking a payment on the gas altogether.I get another e mail to ring them as now my gas reading is not validated and I spend three sessions of 20 mins listening to some god damn awful music interspersed with the dulcet tones of a young lady saying 
5794|DECIDED TO TRANSFER SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND WAS ASSURED  THEY WERE SEEING TO IT . I CANCELLED MY D/D WITH FORMER SUPPLIER  AND TWO MONTHS LATER INQUIRED WHY  EDF HAD NOT BEEN IN TOUCH . ASKED A THIRD PARTY AGENCY TO FIND OUT AND THE THIRD PARTY   TOLD ME THAT EDF WERE NOT PROCEEDING . YET THEY HAD NOT INFORMED ME OF THIS ! EDF ARE A COMPANY IN MY VIEW WHO SHOULD NOT BE Allowed to trade in the energy supplier market in the UK . They are  grossly incompetent or worse . 
5795|Swithched with them in June and entered an open meter reading for Gas & Electric. 1 month later had to enter an opening read yet again as the system did not register them. About 1 month later again had to enter the gas one as again not registered, but you cannot enter just the gas reading, so had to enter the electric on eas well. My meter reading registered that i had used about 2 kw for that week and even though my account is in credit, they upped my Direct Debit for no reason. Actually rang up and spoke to a lovely customer services lady, who sorted out the direct debit back to the origional rate, as i told her how can they up it if i have not used any yet? Anyway it has now been 3 months and the reading that they sent to my old supplier EON, was incorrect for the gas, but as it was in front and EON's rates were origionally cheaper, i just accepted this. On my online account the electric looks like it is now up an drunning, but the gas account is still not, saying awaiting open read, As a person who actually writes programmes and works with computers for the past 30 years, this has got to be the worse system or set up i have ever seen in my life, absolutely utter cr*p. EON's set up was brilliant, as was their customers services, and if this does not improve, i will revert mine, my motheres and ny friend account which i switched. Talk about not getting their act together. My advice to anyone else, stay away fron these idiots. I switched to the 3 year fixed plan.....
5796|i signed over in october 2010 got asked my gas and electric readings on 13th jan. electric sorted but still no gas bill (now 30th august).cant get through on phone(on phone as i type)now very worried in case a large bill comes in and cant pay.also e-mailed got the standard we will respond in 10 days that was 6 weeks ago. No customer service, no correspondance apart from your bill is increasing, disgusted.
5797|Unable to answer the phone, account was transferred 8 months ago and it still isn't active, i have no idea how much my gas is costing.  This are still able however to re-estimate my usage based on no information and revise up my direct debit....the cheek!
5798|9 months I have been with them and they still havent produced a gas bill despite me constantly asking them.GBP470 in credit now and they wont give me MY money back or reduce my direct debitsHad to cancel the DDs with my bank and now going through the complaints procedures to get my money backSwitching ASAP once my contract ends in December.I was warned they were bad but didnt think they could be as bad as they areEmails go unanswered and telephone calls mysteriously disconnect after spending 20 minutes getting through to a human!AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
5799|USELESS absolute joke, avoid like the plague, customer services and the manager i spoke to were about as much use as a chocolate fire guard (To be polite). I have been trying to get a supply reconnected for 3 1/2 months now and have spent over 5 hours on the phone going round and round speaking to numpties with empty promises. On average 20-30 mins before you even get to speak to someone. Angry and frustrated doesn't even begin to cover how i'm feeling. DO NOT USE!
5800|I decided to change energy supplier thriugh u switch, I was on dual fuel with EDF energy, no problems with them untill I came to switch. The change over to British Gas was in early May. Just to check I rang EDF to check they had the paperwok from B.G on the meter nos and readings at the end of May. They denied all knowledge of receiving anything and said it would be up to 10 weeks before I got a final statement (I do not remember that one in the contract agreement!) Kept ringing thenm fortnightly to chase up as my account was around GBP350 in credit, their custome pleadge from their Customer Services dircetor when I signed up originally saif if you are ever more than GBP150 in credit we will contact you to tell you and refund the excess balnce (They never did!) just a worthless pledge from a faceless useless Custome (lack of)Customer Services Director.Checked with B.G that they had sent the required information and was informed EDF had it, EDF kept comeing up with a different excuse every time I contacted them,. I had unfortunately forgot to cancel the direct debit so the jokers had all the paerwork and knew they should not be taking money but roobeed a further two payments of GBP70 each from my account in June and July.Went on holiday in July and started chasing them up again in Late July, finally got an admission that they had the paperwork, but still no final statement.In August they finally sent out the fuinal statements, they were received on the 5th August, and showed GBP118.00 due back on electrioc and appx GBP255.00 due back on gas.The statements were dated the 17th July, did not come with a covering letter, had closing date that were incorrect in type then altered by hand!On that day they said the monies had been credited back to my Bank account checked today all they had credited back was the GBP118.00 not the credit on the gas as well.Got an e-mail today (11th August) saying they would be closeing my case as it was now resolved.What can I say, they had in exces of GBP400.00 of my money for in excess of 4 months, say they have done something when they have not, apper to tell different stories on a situation dependant on the day, do not know what they are doing and probaly treat their customer service staff like poorly, so customers get dealt with badly.I'm sure we will sort this out one day.
5801|!!DO not do not do not use this company !!!!!!!  i have today 5th aug 2011 tried to contact them no joy just on hold then cut off started to ring at 10am it is now 5.15 pm  no answer i am going to email them and cancel the switch to them, bgas who i am with now are not the cheapest but at least they answer the phone i suppose cheapest is not always best .
5802|"Useless. Transfered thru uswitch and they setup the wrong flat.They took money even though i cancelled contract still trying to get it back weeks later.When calling customer services expect ""sorry, we are experiencing exceptionally long waiting times"" EVERY TIME U CALL NO MATTER THE TIME OR DAY typically 20-30 minsDont touch with a faeces laiden stick, It'll get dirty!"
5803|Having moved from my house and advising EDF I keep getting red bills for gas use after I had left that home.  After trying to ring their totally hopeless customer service telephone line I have resorted to writing to Steve Hayfield their Customer Service Director twice and no curtesy reply but more red bills!!!!!!  I will never use EDF again.  USELESS!!!!  what do I do now????? can't talk to anybody and can't get an answer to my letters!!!!   If you ever read these reviews Mr Hayfield (ficticious) would you mind answering my letters!   
5804|I moved house in April, EDF were informed and given meter readings by me and the inventory clerk. In May I called to find out where my refund (GBP120 overpaid through direct debit) was. After 40 min in a call center queue I finally spoke to a human (or maybe it was a talking chimp) to be told a cheque would be sent within 30 days. It's now July and still no refund.I signed up with EDF because they were offering what looked like good rates but am now regretting it. I will never return to them, their customer service is a joke and I despair of getting my money back. Next stop for me will be Ofgem and Trading Standards. If anyone else finds themselves in the same situation, I highly recommend reporting them to Ofgem - they have the powers to fine EDF for this thieving behaviour.
5805|I've been holding phone line for 30mins with my mobile. No one should use edf energy. I'm throwing my money in the air.I just want to talk to advisor for moving home. really frustrating.
5806|Have been trying to contact EDF energy for two days now with little success.  I am on hold for 30mins at at time and still yet to talk to someone.  I am wondering if they have all gone on holiday from the extotionate rates we pay!Do they want they money?  I don't think so.  I have sent them a complaint email to have a call returned to me so time will tell!
5807|The EDF call system is a joke, only closely followed by their completely useless website and meter reading service.Having spent over 2 hours waiting to be answered, I have given up.The biggest mistake, I have ever made was changing over to EDF. As soon as I finish my contract in 09/2012, I shall change back to Southern Electric, good customer service, friendly people at the call centre.
5808|I signed up for dual fuel & until I called & pointed out that they were not taking payments for gas through my direct debit, they told me my next payment was quite rightly my subsequent payments would be 50.00. So after my first next monthly payment, was 53.00 followed a few days later by another payment of 50.00! I phoned them & 40 minute later by a man who arranged it to be credited to my account! It never happened. 2 weeks later, still nothing, a 25 minutes call waiting time, I spoke to a girl who was more interested in idle chat with her colleague & cut me off! Another call back to complain & a further 25 minute wait & I spoke to a man who said the girl tried calling me back & said that the money had been credited back (it still hasn't)! I have now involved consumer direct, & sent an email of complaint - a ten day wait for a reply it says! Unless you enjoy waiting on the phone all day for a gutter rate customer service for in-authorised payments to be taken from your account, then EDF Energy is going to be right up your street - good luck with that! 
5809|does it exist?, beginning to doubt that there is nothing there but an automated answer machine, this is without doubt the worst service from any company I have ever dealt with, why should they make money out of me for doing nothing?, no wonder people switch, I will.
5810|"I've just switched to edf, and before I have even completed the process, I'm regretting it.  The only way you can set up an online account is to have an gas/electricity account number....something I've never been given.  I've 'phoned the call centre and just been put on hold and left there.  Apparently, each time I ring, edf are experiencing ""very high volumes of calls at the moment"", so perhaps that means either they have lots of problems and/or not enough staff to deal with the enquiries.  Either way, it's bad.Not being able to get through by 'phone, I emailed, requesting an account number to allow me to set up an online account to see my messages.  Guess what, they sent a request that I can only see once I set up an account....something I can't do until they give me that information, and something I asked for in the first place!Very very poor service, and no matter how you try to contact them, they don't reply.  The only way to get their attention is to cancel the direct debit and get them to contact me when they realise they aren't being paid.  Perhaps then we can sort out this mess."
5811|"I moved into a new house and tried to set-up with British Gas, but had an objection from EDF, the previous tenants supplier. I've had no letters from EDF even though I've been at the house for 6 weeks. However, this my 2nd week of trying to contact the EDF call centre, I don't have time to wait 30+ mins each time I call. No matter what time of day I phone I get a message saying ""we are experiencing very high call volumes"". Absolutely pathetic, been in the queue so far today for 20 mins but will be hanging up soon again as I'm in work."
5812|Switched to EDF as they promised better deal, this was in April and have been trying to set up Direct Debit since then, can't get through via phone, can't do it on my online account and no answer to my e-mails. How the heck am I supposed to contact them? I'm not keen on getting 3 month's worth of bills in one go. What a useless company, never again.
5813|The customer service is terrible.They take what they want from your bank they will not answer the phone at any time of day if you are lucky after being on the phone for 35 minutes,You need someone to explain things, and all you get is someone who hasn't a clue and states thats what we do.JUST CANCELL YOUR DIRECT DEBIT AND THEY WILL CONTACT YOU INSTANTLY.Then in the next post they send you the bill for what you have used:FASTER THAN MAGIC.
5814|Have been trying to tell them that we're moving home. First time had to hold for 30 mins. Next time held for 40 mins. Then got someone who is new who didn't have a clue what to do - asked me for meter readings for my new address which isn't even supplied by EDF!Avoid them - you don't want to have to hold or speak to a complete muppet when they (inevitably) mess something up - or when you have to move house!
5815|Myself and my partner have being attempting to get a final bill from EDF for over 7 weeks now so we can reclaim the deposit (around GBP600) on the flat we moved out of in April. The customer service department are either completely incompetent by not processing the information we give them (meter readings, change of address etc) or, I suspect, not processing the info at all because they can't be bothered to do it, despite over half a dozen calls to them from myself and my partner.  Either way, it's an unacceptable service from a supposedly trusted supplier, and I recommend that anyone thinking of changing their electric/gas supplier stay well clear of them as their business practice appears to be incompetent at best, and at worst downright dishonest.   Also, they overcharged us, twice, last year for one bill by around GBP300 which resulted in over GBP60 pounds worth of bank charges that we shouldn't have had to pay in the first place.  In short, the customer service they provide appears to be very good to begin with but goes downhill very quickly once they've locked you into a contract.  
5816|When we moved into a new property EDF were the suppliers. EDF then sent a prepaid key for a meter that didn't exist. We called EDF every week for at least 3 months and explained that the meter was a normal meter. The most we got was someone sent round to read the meter. At this point we decided to switch to British Gas. When we switched, EDF had put the wrong meter information on the national database meaning that British Gas couldn't take the account over. This resulted in a HUGE bill from EDF energy at the end of the year, even though we were being suppllied by british gas. We were then bullied into staying with EDF even though their rates were extortionate and the customer service non-existant. When we finally left the property, we needed to ammend our payment plan for the rediculous bill. 1 hour later i'm still on hold. Avoid EDF at all costs, they are liars, bullies and cheats.
5817|"Absolute joke - got a letter telling me i was moving house out of the blue and then had to wait 40 mins on hold to try and sort it out only to be told that ""my account had been migrated to a different system"" and someone would call me back. No one called back, obviously."
5818|"edf Customer services? Does it exist??? Hours on phone but ""advisers very busy but call has moved up the queue"" NO IT HAS NOT!!"
5819|"We initially went with EDF for the Nectar points. Unfortunately due to bad administration it took 9 months calling at least once a month to setup dual fuel so we would benefit from their discount, each time being told it was setup now and then to receive another letter within a few weeks saying ""Did you know you can setup dual fuel and receive discount"". In the end they never set up the duel fuel and they stop the nectar reward point scheme so I decided to leave. Adding to this was missreading the digit on the gas bill so x10 to our bill, I corrected it but it appears they have uncorrected it again. Customer service is polite once you spend best part of an hour on hold to get to them. Administration is poor at best and I told them this when I left. The outgoing sales team called to ask why I left and I told them poor administration/management, he said it's another department (poor excuse) and they could sort it out, I did not trust they would. 1 week later the outgoing sales team call me to say they just been notified I am leaving; I almost expected this and told them I'd already got a call from them, and I expect another one."
5820|Wow, while waiting in the queue for the 5th time for more than 45 minutes without ever getting someone on the phone I started looking up this reviews about the company and all I can say it s all true what the others write. I worked in customer service myself but this is really rediculous. I m actually just calling because the previous tenant was supplied by them and I just wanted to tell them that I definetely DON T want to be their new customer, but how is someone supposed to get the message to them?! 60 minutes in the queue now....
5821|Call centre is hopeless. Go somewhere else.......
5822|EDF has been menacinging me for more than one year using the contract. They wre trying to scare money out of me. If my business stop trading, I will have to pay a heavy fine to them to end the contract. They say that if my contract with the landlord not end then my contract with EDF not end as well. 
5823|I dont know where to begin, they are just useless, AVOID!
5824|Been trying to change from Dual Fuel with Eon. EDF treat gas and Electricity separately and charge for each! Anyway asked me consistently to register and provide info via the net! Their URL provided doesn't exist. Got one of many letters asking for info by phone, rang them didn't know what they wanted! They canceled the contract due to the lack of info and now want to charge me GBP35 for breaking it! To cap it all, EON tell me EDF are still proceeding to transfer my Gas Account! 1 point, negative if I could!
5825|"edf call waiting times are a joke-and today I recieved a letter saying they were not preceeding with my supply.After waiting 15mins on the phone they said the letter was sent in error.""Sorry"" they said.""What a cock up ""I said"
5826|Unbelievably bad customer service. If they were any other kind of business they would be out of business already. Spent 3 periods of 40 minutes waiting for an answer on the phone and gave up. Wrote a detailed letter instead and received no reply, no acknowledgment, nothing. I moved house over a month ago and they continue to charge me for the old account. I have now cancelled my direct debit payments, presumably that will get their attention eventually. Terrible company, avoid them like the plague.
5827|EDF are one of the most useless companies I ahve ever had the misfortune to deal with.  Switched my electricty and gas suplies to EDF Energy in November 2010.  6 weeks to transfer the electricity supply (ok), and a frankly ridiculous 14 weeks to transfer the gas - and that only happened after 4 phone calls from me chasing them up.  By that point the deal I had switched to had ended, and they put the prices up!!  Now I find that my 'on-line energy' account cannot be accessed on-line, as their system is being updated and could be down for weeks or months...  Poor, poor, poor, service, backed by false promises and rubbish systems.  Avoid.
5828|"If you value your mental health steer well clear of EDF.  A complete waste of time and energy.  Constant excuses of ""system problems"".  Average of 30-40 minutes to speak to ""customer service"" who can only offer weak excuses. I applied to switch over four months ago and the switch is still not completed despite numerous telephone calls and emails which go unanswered for the most part or take weeks for a reply.  I really don't understand why this firm is still in business.  Stay away!"
5829|Well where do i start i see from other reviews that the online saver 7 switch has gone very wrong and yo are correct i have been trying to get my gas account active since the 17 January which is the supply start date blimey have i made some complaints because it still has not been done they just keep saying they have a computer problem, idiots, i received an email saying log into your account on the 02/03/2011 so did just that thinking ahh gas now sorted o no it was to say welcome bla bla bla we will start taking direct debit payments for your electric on 02/02/2011 and then the 01 of every month after that ahhhhhhwhat a joke i have made two direct debits for electric the email is a month late and still no gas set up COMPUTER PROBLEM dont sign up to edf they are a joke i cannot believe the hassle i'm having ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
5830|EDF are absolutely rubbish! Prices aren't great, and definately not good enough to make up for the awful customer service! When you call them you are on hold for about 10 minutes, then you get a very stressed out sounding team member wish excuses not answers! Obviously it is as stressful working for them as it is having them as your utility provider.
5831|EDF are an appalling utility company. All their so called 'systems' (which they constantly use as excuses for mistakes) are stacked in their favour and against the customer. I'm tired of having to call them every quarter to sort out mistakes to my bills. Why don't they understand that customers aren't interested in their internal workings - they just want good service. Don't touch them.
5832|I've been trying to call them three times today but each time I gave up after half an hour. It seems to be impossible to get through. I switched over to them in November but they only seem to have done it for electricity, still nothing has happened for gas - very poor service!
5833|web site doesn't work takes at least 10 days before they reply to queries staff don't phone you back when they say they will can't see my bills can't understand my continually adjusted bills web queries ignored in other words...use somebody else
5834|been with EDF for 3 years everything great until they increased my monthly gas and lec payments from GBP20/GBP30 to GBP45/GBP50.  decided to move to Eon. received a phone call from EDF asking why i was moving and after i told them they said can you give us another chance, we are fixing our prices blah blah blah! So stupidly i said ok.  they said they could stop the change over to Eon and everything would continue to run as before, why did i listen to them. the lec has continued fine but the gas has yet to get up and running, i am gettin letters from Eon and final demand gas bills from EDF as they never restarted the gas payments. i havent a clue whats going on and have been trying to contact EDF every day for the last week been on hold for over 30 mins, 3 hours in one week! i have better things to do with my time, so stuff you EDF!
5835|I have recently switched to Online Saver v7 provided by EDF energy, which in hinsight was the biggest mistake of my life. The contract confirmation which was dated 1st of the month did not arrive until the 19th of the month. The letter stated that my direct debit payments would be GBP450 per month as a combined charge for both gas and electricity. I contacted EDF customer services (a term which appears to be joke as they are neither customer focused or providing any form of service) I was kept on hold for 40mins and was eventually informed that I had a 12 day cooling off period from the date of the letter and they could not update the details as they were experiencing difficulties with the computer systems. I have contacted EDF several times and the same excuse about the computer system is often repeated.  Unless you are keen to sign up with a energy supplier who keep you on hold for 40mins- 2hours and then inform you that they can't help you as the computer system is not working that I would recommend EDF who excel at poor customer service.
5836|I have recently changed my supplier to EDF. The online meter reading system will not let me put on my Electric meter reading, only the Gas.  My previous suppler have now sent me an estimated bill with more than 300 kWh of electricity on it - figures supplied by EDF. I have now been holding for 45 minutes trying to speak to an operator. It appears this is a normal waiting time for EDF, anything up to 3 hours !!! Never had this problem with British Gas. I think I will be changing my supplier again in the near future. Wish I had looked at the revue site BEFORE changing supplier.
5837|EDF are a disaster zone, stay away if you can. I would switch except I dread to think what mess they would make of it. I had months of issues with them over what they called 'system errors' as they're system wouldn't send out bills for my gas. As a result I had to contact them when I wanted a bill! Yet more phone calls.  Today, even giving a meter reading is proving difficult. The automated system isn't working and the overwhelmed call centre has call wait times of 30 mins+. I feel sorry for the call centre workers. Their management is clearly letting them down and leaving them to cope on the frontline with angry customers. Can't make for a good day at work. Wake up EDF management. 
5838|"Have just switched to EDF energy and have am unable to log my gas meter reading on their site.  Am calling but held for 30 mins.  Call picked up but all I could hear was their ""busy"" operators talking about their next weekend out.  Am now on hold again - another 30 mins?!!!  APPALLING!  Wish I hadn't switched.  Its not worth it."
5839| EDF are truely appauling! My transfer to them was delayed due to their poor service. It's an online account and I received numerous welcome emails and provided them with my meter readings three times!! You ring them but they never answer calls. My call times were between 30 and 85 minutes - none were answered by EDF customer services. I hung up in each case and on one occasion I was cut off as their call centres closed! I sent a total of 4 emails but only one was answered. They are so poor at customer service I'm now in the process of going back to my previous supplier and paying a fee of GBP60 to get out of the contract with EDF. Avoid EDF at all costs - Scottish Power are far better!!!
5840|EDF customer service leaves a lot to be desired. It is very difficult to get through: the advisors, whilst helpful on the line, don't actually call you back, leaving you the customer to spend time trying to get back through again to follow up.  Very frustrating. After 3 months, I am still waiting for my electricity to be transferred over - some problems with the 'systems' apparently. Not very impressive. 
5841|We were with EDF for 14 months, and have just ended our contract with them in September. We were dual fuel customers and over the 14 months our charges increased from GBP50 a month (GBP20 for electricity, GBP30 for gas), to GBP80 a month (GBP35 for electricity, $45 for gas). We moved supplier to Southern Electric who, for the same usage would charge us a total of GBP60 (GBP25 for electricity, and GBP35 for gas), and have also provided us with two GBP40 off vouchers for our bill to use, the first for use after the first 3 months, the second after the first 6 months.   We received our final statement from EDF around 2 weeks after we transferred accounts, notifying us that we were GBP109.54 in credit. Of course I didn't assume EDF would automatically transfer this back into my account so I rang asking them to do so. I was told that the amount would be refunded to my account within 2 weeks. Needless to say the 2 weeks passed, so I rang again. The staff I spoke to the second time around didn't seem to have any idea who I was or why I was ringing, as the account had been archived. After speaking to 3 different people I was assured that the money would be refunded to my bank account within 28 days?! 28 days passed and still no refund. I've had to ring EDF again this morning to ask where my money is and was told that because I moved supplier, my bank account details had been deleted from EDF's system and I would never have gotten my money back. They are sending me a cheque, due to arrive within 7-10 working days. 
5842|I was happy with EDF until I set eyes on their Eco manager gimmick!! What a joke this has turned out to be. Their customer support is non-existent and the system failed within the first week, there is very little to no setting up instructions and in my experience it all comes down to guess work. They are now asking me to pay a GBP49.99 cancellation fee even though I have had it for less than a month, I was also asked to return the system at my own costs for investigation. NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH EDF, Complaint letter sent to their head office.
5843|I have found my bills quite hih at times and mistakes have been made but when a bill is a bit late or for instance I paid a GBP200 bill but because I was GBP10 short I get constant calls day and evening every day, I call that harrassement as it is not as though I am not paying when I have just dished out GBP200 at onece. 
5844|EDF seem to have a policy whereby if you are late paying a bill (they give you roughly 10 days which is way too short) they will continuously call you and harass you on a Saturday to pay your bill, automated of course, I had to turn off my phone it got so annoying. This being my first bill so giving them no real reason to use such crass tactics! I will be switching suppliers as soon as I can. If you don't want to be harassed I'd use another supplier which gives you a decent amount of time to pay a bill.
5845|Value for money and the switch was pretty easy, but leaving a meter reading is a nightmare.  It is an automated service asking you your account number and some other yes/no questions.  After all that, it still puts you on hold (for ever) to speak to an advisor.
5846| After sorting out my overcharged EDF gas bills, I have been chasing the company for two years in order to obtain any electricity bills/statements. Eventually, I found out that my bills were sent to a different address which is completely irrelevant to me. My account and the property's previous resident were mixed up, and the bills I received after two years were showing wrong info and were no proof of my address. Had to call and email them endlessly. EDF's customer service is very kind but failing to do its job properly.
5847|I have now been on hold to their call centre for  31 minutes 53 seconds. They have just disconnected the call. It is not a free phone service from mobiles. Ringing with regard my meter reading being 20000 less then their estimate. Not happy is an understatement.
5848|I switched to EDF in October of last year. During January my boiler broke and I was without heating for almost a month, the following month I was on holiday. The only thing that I could look forward to after a month in the freezing cold was my gas bill, when it arrived it stated that in the previous 3 months I had used GBP750 of gas! I phoned then up and gave them a gas reading, which they told me was different from the one they have received from their gas reader and my bill was only around 30 pounds. Luckily I do not have a weak heart so this situation was resolved in under an hour. Since then I have been given a wrong reading for every quarterly bill, and it is now second nature to phone them with my correct reading every three months. Their estimate always adds at least GBP20 onto my bill. I plan to move in the next few months and I will be changing suppliers when I do so.
5849|This is probably the worst company I've ever had the misfortune to deal with, I don't want to even give them 1 star, but it seems to be the lowest I can enter.  Two years ago I moved into a studio flat in London.  A few days later I received a bill from EDF for about GBP20 which I paid.  As months went by, I realised I hadn't had another bill from EDF so I called them to find out what was going on.  They proceeded to tell me that hey had no record of my flat and that I wasn't their customer.  I got off the phone very frustrated and tried to find my original bill.  Unfortunately, due to the move, it had be lost or thrown away, so I called again and was again told, no record of my flat.  I must have called them at least 3 times a month over the space of about 4 months before giving up and asking them to send me a letter to confirm that I wasn't their customer and that I wouldn't be receiving a high bill from them in the future.  The letter never arrived 2 months later I had a demand from them for over GBP1000 for the electric I had used in the last year.  I was furious!  After several heated conversations with them I finally agreed to pay them GBP130 a month which would be split to both pay off my arrears as well as any new charges.  This actually worked fairly well (with only a few smaller issues that occurred with their billing system (you can't make two payments within a few days for some reason, even though they don't bother to tell you this or let you know that the second payment was unsuccessful) and it wasn't until; the agreement came to an end that I had more problems.  In January this year, the agreement came to an end and I was told my bill would now only be around GBP50 a month - fine.  Then I got one big bill through for about GBP300.  I was told it was a bill for the last quarter, which was a little annoying as at no point had I been told my bills would be switching to quarterly payments, but fine, I paid the bill.  In February, rather than wanting to have another big bill at the end of the quarter, I decided I would pay GBP100 a month into my account (double what I had been told my monthly bill would be) just to make sure I would get no further nasty surprises.  When I paid this money in, my account was left GBP50 in credit.  Then, at the end of March I paid another GBP50, meaning to pay the other GBP50 in the following week from a different card, but stupidly didn't listen to my account balance. A week later I received another bill saying that I was over due on a payment of GBP150!  So this meant that within the space of a month (Feb - March) my bill had been GBP250!  GBP250 for a studio flat, for 1 month, and this is for electric only!!  I told them that it was ridiculous and asked why it had been so much.  I was told that because it was winter, I probably had the heating on more - this was rubbish as my flat is very warm anyway, I remember last year having my window open on Christmas Day because it was so warm, so I rarely have heating on even on the coldest nights.  EDF have refused to look into this any further and suggested I pay to have an independent electrician come out to check my wiring, but with bills this high at seemingly random intervals, I can't afford to do that!  How can an electricity company get away with charging you ridiculously  high prices for electric, but take no responsibility for making sure that what they are charging you is correct?  Right now I feel like I have no choice but to keep paying these high prices, or find another supplier, and I think that's what I'll be doing! 
5850|Only one star because that is the lowest that I can give.  Got our gas meter type wrong and charged us almost three times what they should have.  They blame everyone else but themselves.  I am only getting the money back after two years of misery.   I advise anyone not touch this comapny with a barge pole.    Customer advisers can be very unsympathetic at times. 
5851|We are with EDF pro in France with 2 supplies for holiday accommodation, November 2009 we had a letter from them saying there was a problem, 1st to 3rd December 2009 we had two visits.  Jan 6th 2010 we had a bill 1400'. As we had no clients in the Gites since September 2009 we were shocked, checking the meter there had been 40000 units added since I last checked it.(We phone EDF and we was on hold for 2 hours and finally we got through and the girl told us to phone back as she didn't have the soft wear to deal with it)  So I checked the other meter and that also had 40000 units added, this 2nd meter has a limit of 15kw. Going from their last reading (Not Estimated) we have used 40536kw in 2 months that is 27.4kw per hour (We are limited to 15kw) We called in the Huissiers de Justice and he confirmed the meter was faulty, this report cost us 250' and was sent to EDF recorded post and a further report was sent out from the Justice and both have beed ignored by EDF.  Both meters have shown the same reading and we can not see what we are using. 40930 and the other meter 60975 and they don't move.(Is this against the law?) They have taken 2500' out of our account. Also after the storm our cables are still on the ground (9 days)we have been advised by an English electrician not to take any bookings in case a child touches it and we have to drive over it. In our opinion they know that 40000 units have been added as all the last three bills have been estimated (Every 2nd they usually read the meter) At this stage we have paid for 3 years of electric, we think that we are being forced out of bussiness because we are English. we are desparate for help as we are running out of funds, it has made us ill. Is there anyone out there can help or had the same problem? margaret.johnson@wanadoo.fr  
5852|Totally unsatisfied expensive bills compared to other suppliers I switched to utilitywarehouse much cheaper and excellent customer service I recommend utilitywarehouse 
5853|"This affects blocks of flats, properties where the mains comes in and is distributed via a 'head board' in phases to different floors, offices or flats. EDF are the mains electricity supplier for London, ie the supply side not the consumer side.  While there are a range of regulations for safety of consumers when it comes to the consumer supply, for communal lighting in blocks of flats, for fuse boards, earthing, you name it, there are no regulatory requirements for the mains supplier to make sure their equipment is in good condition and safe.  But by regulation only that mains supplier is allowed to touch that equipment so commercial property owners and landlords cannot have contractors test the head fuse boards.   I was told by EDF that when the phase on the head board is 'arcing' or burning, that is it telling you that it is worn and needs replacing.  And they said ""the fire-brigade is our back-up"". Perhaps that is why it took them four hours to send out an engineer to make the arcing head fuse safe - and even then they did not get a move on until residents began to smell burning.  Thanks a lot EDF. Why doesn't the government make it mandatory for these energy suppliers to have a safety check service?  "
5854|As a reasonably happy customer of EDF for around 2 and a half years, I am horrified at the way I have been dealt with when trying to switch to a cheaper supplier. First I was slapped with a bill for over GBP900. This has now been reduced to nearer GBP300. On the same day I received my reduced bill (payable by 1st October), I was sent a letter demanding immediate payment, saying the money was overdue. After being cut off by the call centre on 3 separate occasions, I asked to split the payment into two. I paid half, and have since been send a letter threatening legal action demanding payment for the full amount - despite having already paid half. They can't seem to get their admin right and so now I will have to waste even more of my time on the telephone to get this resolved. 
5855|would definatly recommend to a friend, was origionally with N power having very very high bills, when looking at my unit prices EDF smashed them, and now i am paying the discounted rates (as i call them) which is reducing my yearly bill by over 400, very well done to edf
5856|I loved my time on EDF Energy, Their Call Centres were very helpful and they always dealt with us quickly and efficiantly, Since buying a new house we have been with Scottish and Southern and have been trying to switch back, Our bills are higher and every time we try and talk to someone we get nowhere (Although we do get several letters reminding us why we joined - Which we never wanted to.)
5857|Avoid at all costs. According to EDF I use 17000kwh per year! The dont talk to each other. 
5858|i was with british gas a quarter before and i was paying around  GBP400 a quarter for both of my gas and electricity for my just 2 bed room flat (even though i was promised cheapest rate from british gas). talking about customer services, they have never been upto the mark. if in case u got any querries or questions? u need to call 0845 number, where u are charged for every single minute and operators never answer your call until they keep you holding for long and long.right after, when i changed over to EDF, i have almost been saving over 20% on my utility bills plus you receive excellent customer services with 0800 (free phone number). furthermore, u enjoy dual fuel discount and points over your nectar card.overall, great value for money.
5859|Have transferred, get a better service and saved money, what more can you ask for? Excellent customer service from UK call centres, support from local seller, fast reliable internet, cheper all around than previous suppliers, good itemised bill showing simply what you have used for each utility.
5860|"Customer Service has been shocking at EDF. I have tried to sort out my catch up problems with them on four occasions now and still they keep demanding payment with no real explanation of their actions. I will have to pay the outstanding bill but am disgusted at the way i have been treated as one of their ""valued customers."" "
5861|Brilliant marketing skills to get new customers. Changed from southern electric to EDF january 2007 after receiving e-mail promising price freeze till summer 2010, Two weeks ago received letter saying my electric was going up. Phoned up to query this and was told it was a mistake and my account would be amended and a new prepayment key would be sent out to rectify the price increase, 3 days later no key arrived so phoned again, only to be told that the offer I supposedly  took up 12 months ago was not eligable to people living in the south !!!! Now going back to southern electric.
5862|I haven't had any problems in my new place with EDF energy, but I will be switching as they charged me for the wrong meter for over a year and it took about the same time to get a proper bill back! They seem to have improved their customer service since then though.
5863|Very good customer service at EDF Energy, efficient - and no problems touch wood. Well you can be on hold when you want to speak to somebody for way too long, but they do have certain busy hours and quiet ones where you get straight through.
5864|EDF Energy are good value for money electricity suppliers.
5865|I have to say that I am very pleased with EDF Energy. Since switching, I reckon I'm saving 20% or more compared to what I had been paying with British Gas. The process took some time, but I don't think that this was anything in EDF's power. Once switched, I had to contact EDF to point out that they had the wrong meter reading. I don't know if they made a mistake, or if it was British Gas, but between the two a mistake was made.That said, I would recommend anyone to change suppliers. I am quite a heavy user, and I found this company to represent the best value for money, and to have a high user rating.
5866|a phone call reminding me of my end date.a description of various tariffs, prices etc.an e-mail a few clicks  done.so simple.
5867|very helpful and professional
5868|USED MAKE IT CHEAPER FOR ALL MY BUSINESS BILLS,GAS,ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE.THEY ALWAYS SANE ME TIME AND MONEY WITH NO HASSLE.BRILLIANT SERVICE

5872|Staff are very Professional and knowledgeable, understood our needs and spent time to find the right deal for us.  The after care and communication with Make it Cheaper is excellent, they are not pushy with you in anyway and give you time to make the right decision before entering into any contract, would definitely recommend them.  
5873|Great service - the rep was friendly and personable, understood the needs of our business and went the extra mile to find a deal that saved us money. My call was answered quickly and the call centre itself seemed a lot quieter than it used to be, so it was a much easier to hear what was being said than last year. Everything was explained in a clear and straightforward way so, all-in-all, a good experience that resulted in us saving quite a bit of money. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Would be interested to know if they could save me money on my home electricity bill as well...
5874|I have used Make It Cheaper for several years now and wouldn't think of going anywhere else when our electricity contract comes up for sale.  The staff are helpful, the advice is given immediately and there is no hassle with the changeover of suppliers.
5875|All aspects first class
5876|I was dreading the week ahead in searching for the best deals on gas and electricity, certain we were paying over the odds. MIC made it easy!MIC were incredibly efficient and personal in helping me change and save on my utilities bills across number of locations. The service was quick and hassle free with all communication to the point, just what I needed with a busy schedule. My contact was always there to help and discuss options and explain to me the best course of action where required in order to make the best saving for my company.Thanks MIC. 
5877|Very impressed and will certainly use again
5878|Was stuck with a company that I did not want to be with, very long story and could not see a way out.Thanks to these guys I got great advise and help all the way and found a way to get my company back on track and try and rebuild the damage done.Would recommend to anyone and everyone.
5879|Fed up with your present energy supplier? Feel like you're not being listened to? Then try Make it Cheaper.They not only understand your business / charity but will go the extra mile to help in whatever way they can. Friendly, knowledgeable and customer focused, the two advisors I spoke to provided me with clear, understandable and jargon free relevant energy provider advice. Saving money into the bargain. You'll wonder why you didn't use them before. And with bulk buying ability it looks like we have the potential to keep on getting the best deals.
5880|Good service, as practice manager having to manage many tasks, is brilliant to get call reminder from Make it cheaper staff and help us to find good offers out there for our practice.
5881|We have used Make It Cheaper for a number of years now for electricity supply, credit card services and business insurance.  Their agents all appear to have a great knowledge of the services on offer and do a great job in making the whole process simpler for the customer. 
5882|I am treasurer (unpaid) for a v small charity. It is important that we get good value for the people who support us. However I work full time - I do not have time to mess around.Thanks for securing for us a good deal but making it as easy and quick as it was.Thanks again.
5883|Got our new telecommunication deal with make it cheaper , saving around GBP100 per month which is a lot of savings for a small business, staff are professional, polite and informed. Hassle free and time savingWould recommend and have recommended to local small businesses.
5884|Very helpful pleasant adviser, process of taking out a new contact takes quite a long time. So done via email this year. 
5885|I have just switched to Make it Cheaper and found it easy to do with out any problems
5886|The staff were really helpful and patient, even though I couldn't decide what to do. There was no press at any time.
5887|Would like to have the option of receiving an email with the tariffs you have just been quoted, then with the hour a second call to finalize which tariff/provider you wish to take.You currently pressurised a decision immediately after giving you a couple of tariff options from a couple of different providers.
5888|The service was excellent and the advisor was very polite and helpful.  This has not only saved me time today but I know it will make things much easier in the future. I would definitley recommend this service to other businesses.
5889|GOOD SERVICE AND ADVICE
5890|Saves time & great savings to be made. 3rd time of using now & would not think about going anywhere else. Very trusting. 
5891|Happy to help always polite and returned calls if they said they would. Sorted out a few small prblems 
5892|Like the fact that all the searching is done for you, receive documents straight away so you know what you are paying for.
5893|I had  a terrible time with gas installation in general and Make it Cheaper was smooth as Silk for their part
5894|Customer service is professional and friendly. New contracts sorted out quickly saving me the headache of trying to compare energy providers myself. Again, this year I have been able to save money and am very happy with the service provided by Make it Cheaper.
5895|Saves time, hassle and money, I highly recommend giving them a call.
5896|As a small business we need to make savings wherever we can, but researching the best deal takes time. Make It Cheaper do it for me - no hassle, no wasted time and they always save me money. They explained everything in a straightforward way and e-mailed me any information I needed rather than telling me over the phone. No one can afford NOT to use them.
5897|Good helpful and hassle free initial documentation, but dealing with follow up questions not so easy and one has to keep close tabs personally on what is happening.
5898|Time is precious in any business. What  more can one ask when you save time as  well as money!using MIC.Exellent service and without joining queues to call centres.
5899|i tought the people i spoke to we're really helpful.They got what I neededed and at good price
5900|This company know their stuff, they listen to your situation, and then provide the best product that they can for your situation.  They actually speak to you in a friendly manner, even when you don't know what your doing.
5901|Was at little apprehensive at changing after my previous mistakes, but this was a good move. Cheaper and just as quick to get the money into my account.One area of improvement would be to put a date on the bank statement showing which day the money was paid to me by the customer, so I can cross reference it easier. Global payments did this and it was useful.
5902|was a very helpfully 
5903|I am very busy and make it cheaper has made my life easier.
5904|Quick & easy. I would definitely recommend and use again!
5905|Very polite and professional. Saved me the effort of investigating myself for prices of business insurance and liability. Could I have got it cheaper? I don't know if I'm honest because time and hassle is more important to me on this kind of one off payment . I will periodically check the internet for like quotes and check it is competitive but if it is a coupe quid more expensive I wont overly worry as it saves me time every year to have MIC phone me when the insurance is due and give me the quote based on their research. If I feel the quote is unfair I wont use it . There are plenty of other companies who offer this service to make a comparison . Overall I feel MIC are a good efficient company with polite staff so I would recommend them. 
5906|I wish I knew how simple changing business energy was before, it's always been such a hassle. I was given prices, almost half what I was paying with the same company, I agreed them, a contract was emailed whilst still on the phone which was computer signed and that was all I had to do. Quick, easy, efficient and saved me lots of money. Couldn't be better.
5907|Great service would recommend to anyone. Very helpful and you get the best deal 
5908|I have been dealing with this company now for a couiple of years over that time they have saved our business hundreds of pounds.The service they give is no nonsense, trustworthy, and efficient.  Exactly what I need when time is precious.
5909|Our original suppier caused us some problems but they managed to deal with it.
5910|Makeitcheaper provide an excellent, friendly, helpful service which takes the has sell out of finding low cost utility prices for not for profit organisations. I would certainly recommend them to any other small businesses or not for profit organisation wishing to find cost efficient service.
5911|As we have not been transferred over to Make it Cheaper yet I am going by the claim that we have been paying a 15p connection charge for each call with Utility Warehouse.As we do a lot of telemarketing calls this will save a considerable amount per month on our telephone bills. Namely around GBP70.00 
5912|I recently used the Make It Cheaper (MIC) Team to transfer our gas & electricity supplies on a new business unit we took over. They found me a better rate on each supply than I would otherwise have paid and removed the hassle of having to deal with the suppliers directly.The whole process was smooth and easy. The staff at MIC are always polite & helpful and do call you back when they say they will. All round excellent customer service.Recommended!!!
5913|I am pleased to have come in contact with make it cheaper at a time I am wondering what my present supplier was doing with my business supplies as they keep doubling my charges every quatre. and up and up goes the charges and if challenged they tell me its an estimated reading.I am glad that make it cheaper can solve this problem for me by halfing the charges for me.the sales person was so courteous and straight to the point, and the speed at which the transfer was done was so convenient for me. I would have love to know the rate at which I am charged before this purchase.well done and keep making it cheaper 
5914|It is always helpful to be able to receive a good service from the first contact from an organisation you are about to do business with and I was glad to speak to just one person who knew what exactly they were to going to do to satisfy my need.  
5915|it was a very good and well organised com . Who deal with there customer friendly manor and sorts out things fast .But takes longer time ...
5916|As a low user with 2 meters (block of flats, communal hallways, security lighting and garages) we were looking for an electricity tariff with low/zero standing charges. Make it cheaper proactively found us a good deal with a new supplier and managed the switch from end to end, saving us time, hassle and money. All documentation sent electronically in clear and concise format so we have backups of everything that was agreed.
5917|Very simple process once the decision was made to change supplier and I had to do very little other than say yes and click twice on an email. 
5918|It was a quick and easy process that didn't take too long, but did save me money. I fail to see why businesses wouldn't use this service.
5919|I liked the helpful and friendly way my inquiry was dealt with. I did not have to deal with a mass of automated options and felt I got help and advice tailored to my specific needs ensuring I got the policy that was right for me. Above all the gentleman that dealt with my claim was excellent in dealing with all aspects of what my business needed.
5920|The service was generally very good with staff being polite and friendly but also professional. The company helped me to save a lot of money. 
5921|Fast and easy way to get cheap electric. I would recommend this service to any small business. It showed me just how much you are getting ripped off by electric suppliers.
5922|Easy, quick and stress free and you get the best deal possible. 
5923|Essential service to my small businesseasy processfriendly and efficient
5924|We have used Makeitcheaper for many years now and always get great results. Always saves us money and time
5925|Great product knowledge
5926|We had a complex case as we are a large building and the rep was very helpful, explained things clearer and saved us money. I would definitely recommend to a friend.  
5927|I have been using Make it Cheaper for our company's electricity (and Gas) for several years now.  They call me when it is time to renew and are patient and informative.  They do not push me into anything and respect my decisions if I wish to wait a while.  I do not normally use companies to source better prices but I took a chance with this one and they have not let me down.
5928|a very straight forward swap of companies and takes the hassle of me 
5929|Everything was done very professionally and would recommend to my business a cocci ages
5930|Quick, Easy, Efficient staff and money saving 
5931|very knowledgeable staff, pester you a bit with phonecalls but worth it as they know how to save you money and are very pleasant to speak to. Would recommend using Make It Cheaper to other charities like ours
5932|Great service they take ownership of your problems no stress 
5933|I have used make it cheaper for all utilities for several years now and I always check that the deal they give me is the best on offer and to date it always has been .With a previous broker I dealt with this was not always the case. Make it cheaper make the whole process of changing suppliers very easy. I cannot fault them.
5934|I have been using Make it Cheaper for our company's electricity (and Gas) for several years now.  They call me when it is time to renew and are patient and informative.  They do not push me into anything and respect my decisions if I wish to wait a while.  I do not normally use companies to source better prices but I took a chance with this one and they have not let me down.
5935|I looked online for price comparisons before calling E.On to renew my charity's E.On contract. I couldn't however find prices for a charity so I called the U-Switch helpline - I was quickly transferred to a Make It Cheaper agent who was very knowledgeable, professional and friendly. He compared market prices and bearing in mind we would have to give notice to E.On or pay a penalty, he calculated that staying with E.On would be a good option but achieved a price which was much better than E.On had quoted me. He will also compare the market on renewal to ensure that we get the best price every time. I was impressed with the service and ease of use and mostly of course the cost savings achieved. I would highly recommend this service for businesses and charities alike - there's no point in being loyal to a supplier if the same service can be found at a more economical rate.
5936|My experience was refreshing and rewarding, my questions were answered fully and confidently and the whole process only took 20 minutes!
5937|SAimple procedures, just internet search, telopehone service, guide you all the way throug after accepting the cheapest quote for your business and your area. I will save a third off my electric noe fixed for 2 years. Also they will notify and find me next cheapest wehen date is due so i dont have to worry about missing dealine and fixing on something i dont want to make money out of me like most other big companies who woek on that policy.Theres no long winded paper works to sign and send back, all done via email and a tel conversation to guide you if you have any problems it is dealt with immediately.Would recommend this service!
5938|Simple and hassle free, it was very easy to change suppliers and save money!
5939|Make it cheaper team saves you time and money. Always seem to come up with a better deal without you having to spend hours looking. 
5940|The company representative was knowledgeable, efficient, yet pleasant. He had an excellent manner and has saved us a lot on our energy bills. Furthermore, they take care of the next renewal date, with no obligation. I would highly recommend this company, they provide a great service and are a real asset to small businesses like ours.
5941|We have used Makeitcheaper for some years now and have always found them to be totaly efficient and on the ball , we actually feel they look after our company and we have most definitely saved big money thanks to Makeitcheaper
5942|Quick easy and hassle free
5943|Fast, friendly efficient service that helped our organisation save money. Would recommend to other small charities, organisations or small buisnesses.
5944|As we have utilities for 3 sites, Make it Cheaper takes the hassle out of checking various utility companies prices with three different postcodes. The sales rep checks various term contracts as required and gives the best quotes for that particular site. The contracts are easy to read and check that the pertinent information is there and correct.
5945|This is the second time I have used Make it Cheaper and again they have come up with options that provide substantial cost savings in an area that is relatively complicated and for which I have insufficient knowledge. This time it was for business insurance (previously it was for gas supply) and I saved at least 50% on last year's deal which I did myself. Can't complain about that.
5946|We are a Village Hall in a rural area and funds are only raised through hiring the hall out. It is imperative that the best deal for Gas and Electricity is found. This is where MAKE IT CHEAPER has been fantastic in researching the best possible rates. Thank you..
5947|I have used Make it Cheaper for several years now and they have saved me so much time and money with utilities and business insurance. The sales agents are always polite, helpful and knowledgeable and although inevitably the phone conversations are quite lengthy as they need to elicit and provide certain information in order to advise you properly, I have always felt that it is time well spent. I would certainly recommend them to any small business owner - most of us simply do not have the time to trawl the internet and make endless phone calls to find ourselves a better deal. 
5948|very helpful no problems setting new account up
5949|'Make it Cheaper' take away the headache of constantly searching for better Utility prices and contracts, leaving me to run our business. I have never had any issue with the contracts offered and they have even found me options which are not readily available elsewhere. Their service is efficient and professional and you are not inundated with follow up calls. Which to be frank are a pain in the backside, they seem to have the mix just right, calling when the window opens with the best offers at hand. Great FREE service, well worth a GO.
5950|We run a small charity where every penny counts and remembering to switch contracts was always a downfall of mine and we'd end up paying far too much for the electric by missing the contract date, the first reminder being a whacking great big bill...  Make It Cheaper have taken the hassle out of this, their latest RenewForYou idea has taken it a step further where I don't even have to make time for a phone call to them each year either, wonderful.
5951|I was sceptical when I first received the call and almost hang up.I receive so many nuisance calls and thought this was one of them. I was glad I listened through!The agents I dealt with were polite and not pushy at all!They promptly delivered on their promises and now I have the cheapest gas contract in five years!Thanks, thoroughly recommend.
5952|it is who the call make it cheaper.
5953|Overall the product knowledge and service were very good and making the change was made easier and would recommend this service.
5954|This was so very easy - a phone call and a couple of emails and we were up and running with a new provider for our business. Could not have been any easier.
5955|Liked the fact that it was really easy to switch. I just put in my details, got an accurate estimate for next years tariffs and found one that beat many other Big Switch comparison deals, so I was very happy.Even better, on Top Cash back this company rewards cash back for customers switching too, so not only did I have a good price and switch that appears to be seamless, cheap and efficient process, I also will receive cashback in due course
5956|Attention to detail was brilliant, fully explained everything , the potential savings and the process.Follow up calls to sort out old suppliers was informative and again left nothing unclear.Walked me through everything whilst online and on the phone, simple system.Would confidently recommend to friends and colleagues.
5957|I dragged my heels over comparing my electricity/gas prices as saw it as a chore but wished I had done it sooner when I used your website!  The process was so simple and quick and I changed my provider in minutes.  Thank you for an excellent service :)
5958|"""Does exactly what it says on the tin"" The site gave a full price comparison again each supplier with just one click.  "
5959|I think that the customer service was absolutely outstanding. Everything was explained clearly and no unnecessary questions and answers. The application was quickly and easily completed and I could focus and other tasks. It was a total pleasure dealing with Make It Cheaper - Thank you.
5960|A very easy site and it won't take you ages to fill out.  One of the best comparison sites I've used. I have already recommended my family to this site as it saved me GBP30 a month. 
5961|I was really happy to deal with Makeitchaper. Their agent was polite and not pushy, answering questions I had, and guiding me seamlessly through what is an increasingly messy process.
5962|It is vitally important to make sure that you offer every single tariff when informing the customer so that they may make the best choice of which energy company to choose and therefore secure the lowest energy price.Also it would be helpful to see the commission earned and how much you are prepared to share with the customer.
5963|"""make it cheaper"", why wouldnt you. its like choosing between a wage rise or a wage cut, its not rocket science!"
5964|Brilliant service throughout, even recueved a courtesy call to let me know my paperwork was on its way. Have already recommended to friends and family. 
5965|I found the site easy to use and the instruction clear. I have already recommended this site to a friend.
5966|"I thought the entire process was great from start to finish. The energy adviser was helpful, friendly and did not do the ""hard sell"". He listened to our needs and tailored the service to meet our business requirements. There was no hassle and it was so easy setting up our new supplier. I would happily use ""make it cheaper"" again and will be recommending then to friends and family. "
5967|Great website easy to use recommended also use top cash back for a bit extra these guys r great to find the best deal and easy to explain 
5968|Is ok but place not to bad help full  keep it upmsn hhtrkvi will do man 
5969|Help me save nearly one third of the electricity bill. Very good.
5970|It just goes to show that you can get cheaper prices to those you have been charged on a new proposed contract. Cheap - I have saved nearly GBP900 per year compared to what the present supplier was prepared to charge, by letting Make it Cheaper do the work. The new contract is even cheaper than the old one by GBP400 per year. Thanks 
5971|Great Company with lovely people. Great Value. Saved us loads of money over the years I have used them. Also, it saves me all the time and hassle of trying to find the best provider.
5972|thanks for your help and saving me money on my electricity supply quick n easy
5973|very helpfull  staff and   service and  curtious   people
5974|was quick to start with. We transferred two accounts, one had no issues, the other had a problem at the old suppliers end but you guys kept in touch and let us know what was going on and what we needed to do so everything got sorted which was great.
5975|With a lot of publicity at the moment of changing prices and hype from different organisations it can be difficult to spend the time searching for a good deal when working full time and want to spend your time off enjoying yourself.  One quick phone call and I've got all the hassle free, time off to myself.
5976|We had a really complicated situation, Make it Cheaper sorted it all out and kept us informed of progress. They got us a better deal than another broker too.
5977|Have been using make it cheaper now for a few years and always find them really helpful when changing companies, great to know you are getting the best price & as they telephone when you are coming to the end of a contract you don't have to remember to switch. 
5978|Have been using make it cheaper for a few years now and they have always delivered an excellent service.Never to pushy they just give the info that is required to help you make an informed decision.
5979|Really easy to do over the phone , helpful staff who explained what to do , am saving lots of money by switching. I would recommend this service to any business . 
5980|I am very happy with the service, saved time , hassle and money. Excellent customer service. I will recommend to everyone.  
5981|Quick and easy phone based energy sourcing service. Dont bother looking anywhere else !
5982|Always contact us in good time to remind us when our contract is coming up for renewal. Staff always call when they promise to, and are clear, polite and courteous during the call. It's also great to receive an email summarising what was discussed, allowing reflection before committing to a new supplier. You have made my life so much easier: thank you!
5983|I needed to swap supplier, but did not expect a cash incentive and to literally, have to do nothing.... thank you so much.
5984|Very easy transaction 
5985|So easy to switch. Saves time, hassle and most importantly money!  So far so good and would recommend to friends, family and colleagues. 
5986|I started my energy switch with Make It Cheaper, but there was a problem with my meter numbers.  The staff at Make It Cheaper, kept in touch with me on a regular basis to inform me of the problem so that I was able to sort it out.  The fact that the staff kept me informed regularly as to the progress, meant that I was able to rectify the situation promptly. Although my switch is still in progress, I am reassured that it will now progress smoothly.  Well done for your support, it is appreciated.
5987|Easy to use/understand With clear information. Great for time and money saving
5988|Easy to use. Straightforward and saved me time going around on different websites. Saved me money by switching service.
5989|The name of the company says it all. I  believe they deliver what they promise . Need I say more ? 
5990|The staff member on the other end of the phone was extreamly polite and helpful, I asked if they could phone back just so I could process the information and comparison which he agreed to and was prompt in returning the call, didn't feel any pressure which was nice, all in all very good service. 
5991|you are always there for me  whenever i need to review al my utilities and policies  i wouldent trust anyone but you.
5992|If I had not contacted Make it cheaper then my electric supplier would have just put me on to an expensive rate. They were quick and courteous and when we did have a problem they sorted it out immediately.Very good service and would definitely recommend them to anyone.
5993|helpful to have someone else spend the time reviewing the range of offers out there and suggesting cheaper alternatives.  Sometimes i've gone with the cheaper, sometimes stayed where i am.  But the people never lean on me to make changes I don't want.  And so far they have been very good at contacting me when contract renewal times come round.  So easy to miss them when you are working at the real job and don't have time to study paperwork!  And the providers don't remind you - and it can cost if you don't act before the contract notice periods.
5994|All my questions answered and concerns explained. Cover agreed and accepted and paperwork recieved, all within about half an hour via email. Some aspects of cover not required were removed and policy tailored to suit.Further hard copies recieved a couple of days later as confirmation. Good service.
5995|Very professional, very helpful, always on the ball.  Genuinely seem to put customers first.
5996|Very good service, explained well, give me confidence a that I a not dealing with a rip off company and that the person on the phone does care.
5997|Helpful efficient staff who explain everything in detail and complete the renewal process without wasting time. Anything unclear was solved with simple concise answers which tied up any loose ends.
5998|really useful service.... no hassle just what i needed 
5999|Joey was very helpful and knowledgable. It was easy to understand the process and each step through was thought about. I will be using the service again and have already recommended it to friends.
6000|I am glad I was sent this survey and I hope you change the way you work. I signed up for gas and electricity on the 07.10.14 and it took you until the 26.01.15 to transfer my gas. Up until then I was paying out of contract rates and I am still waiting for my final bill from the company I inherited when I moved into the premises. My electricity has still to be sorted, exactly 4 months has passed and still I wait. Unfortunately the service I have been provided with is totally unsatisfactory and I will not be recommending you as a business. I won't be saying anything negative, I just won't recommend. I will be sending in a letter once I have received my out of contract bills, and I hope some sort of compensation will be due as 4 months of out of contract rates if frankly unacceptable and I dread to think what I will be eventually charged. I was sold 2 contracts and put my faith in your company to deal with the transaction promptly and carefully. But unfortunately I waited far too long for my gas contract to take effect and I am still waiting for the electricity. 
6001|Being the chief cook and bottle washer (literally) I knew I needed to address my electricity tariff but never seemed to have enough time. Stumbling across make it cheaper gave me a few precious hrs to actually spend on me time.
6002|Joseph was very help, understanding and knowledgeable. Always available to help. Above all, saved us loads.
6003|Agent was polite, friendly and very informative. Not pushy at all and went through all relevant options. Gave me time to think and called me back when agreed. Switched to cheaper deal with no hassle, just left it all to them to do. Painless, would definitely use again.
6004|I have used other comparison sites but Make It Cheaper are by far the best in customer service.Always polite and able to listen to your requirements so they are able to understand the customers needs.Whenever I have had to call Make It Cheaper I am always able to speak with the same person which again is a rare thing with most comparision sites.I will always use Make It Cheaper for both my Gas and Electric contracts renewal as it saves me time and hassle in sourcing such information myself.
6005|great service. chap on the phone from sales team was really helpful and patient with me. took me through all the paperwork via email. i have a much better rate on my electricity and it took hardly any time and was minimal hassle. if only all services were this good.
6006|The service was excellent. It was a smooth seamless  transaction  they saved me GBP756 last year on my business electricity and I stayed with my original supplier. Worth doing don't   be scared !!!!
6007|I can say no more than what's in the title!!
6008|great service, quick and efficeint
6009|Friendly and efficient staff saved me around GBP2000 pa on our electricity bills.  It could not have been easier, saving me time, money and hassle.  Signing up to it is an online tick box signature, and all confirmations are by immediate email so it can all happen efficiently whilst I am thinking about it, rather than waiting for a paper confirmation in a week or so. Thank you.
6010|From first enquiry to receiving contract  was completed in a few hours .Excellent service
6011|I have used Make it cheaper three times now. Each time the staff have been very helpful. I know they're sales types, and normally I hate sales types, but they seem to know exactly what my business needs.They are a credit to their training team and HR department. Saved me loads of time, hassle and ultimately CASH, which is fine by me.Gas...Sorted! Leccy...Sorted! Phone and Internet...Sorted!!
6012|Apart from the contract having incorrect details on it and not being able to change it the service received from this company was excellent. The transfer of our telephone system and the installation of a new broadband system will save us money and enable us to provide broadband and an email address for our customers to use. This will bring us into the 21st century.
6013|very pleased with the response and feed back from your guys and would recommend your service to all my friends and business contacts =well done keep it up
6014|My energy contract was up for renewal and the last time I tried to change it was so complicated, I was also bombarded with phone calls and emails after agreeing to change so I was very sceptical about changing energy suppliers,as it was so much hassle last time. But, in todays modern world you have to shop around.  So after calling a few companies I decided to go with Make It Cheaper.  They were extremely helpful they didn't keep me waiting, there was no complicated jargon I found them polite and efficient, easy to understand and non nonsense, they supplied all the forms and change over agreements, all I had to do was sign and they sorted it out. Perfect :) No hassle, no fuss. I would recommend definately.  Thank you 
6015|Renewing through Make it Cheaper was so easy and it took all the hassle out of trying to find the right energy deal, so useful and helpful and they reminded me early enough to sort it out without any panic.  Not much to dislike about the service, staff were also very pleasant when I didnt want to discuss anything else - not too pushy like others I have come across.
6016|It couldn't have been simpler than using 'makeitcheaper'.  Fantastic service, friendly advisor and saved me loads of time and effort navigating a very complex market.   I would recommend this service to anyone.
6017|We get regular calls from a lot companies that want to offer reductions to our utility bills etc but make it cheaper go that much further. They make sure what our requirements are and then negotiate a better deal. Even if they have helped the year before, they help again and reduce costs. They seem to have access to best tariffs and hence are aware of the best deals they can negotiate for us. Anything that helps reduce costs and increase profits is good for the organisation in these times of Osterity. Happy to use their services and would always use them again.
6018|Left details on a comparison website and make it cheaper rang me, took information and promised to save me GBP200+ in one phone call, very easy to deal with, polite staff and done in one phone call.Phone call was about 30 mins so be prepared to be on phone for a while, otherwise would highly recommend.
6019|This was far simpler than I've ever experienced using a standard broker for our insurance needs.  The adviser at Make it Cheaper was knowledgeable of the commercial insurance market and quickly took an assessment of our needs.  He then took a full appraisal of the market and came back to us with alternatives.All in all we saved over GBP1000 on our insurance renewal price of GBP4500 from our existing broker.
6020|Plain talking in simple terms I could understand. No fancy sweet talking, no pressure, felt I was in 'safe hands'. Unbiased and 'real'. I loved the honesty and in fact, I was told straight away I had already been offered the best deal for gas with my current supplier and to stay with them.Loved the fact I wasnt pestered with follow up calls to see if I had come to a decision-like many other suppliers!Will use again and again.
6021|Excellent for fuel, phone and business insurance they've saved us thousands!
6022|the agent was very helpful and discussed options with me.  After sending the written info I then phoned to check something out and once again they took the time to explain all details to me. There was no rushing me or hassling me into agreeing without fully explaining the change.  I felt that I was listened to which makes a change.
6023|I contacted make it cheaper and was very impressed with both the service and prices I received
6024|I had a helpful phone call from a Make It Cheaper representative who enabled me to renegotiate my gas tariff at a better rate even though my contact end date has not yet arrived. He was polite and knowledgeable and even better he did all the paperwork!
6025|Such an easy process - all dates are remembered for you, all costs are explained. Takes the hassle away from keeping with a great value energy supplier. Have recommended to other businesses and will continue to do so.
6026|efficient,friendly straightforward advice would recommend to friends and associates
6027|been with make it cheaper for about 3 years nice , i find them nice and helpful and not pushy like some of the other companies with there over confidant sales people .
6028|good swift service  thanks. very helpful and pleasant staff thank you
6029|They did the leg work with suppliers and came back with best prices.  They went back and re-negotiated when aspects of the price were not as competitive as others and actually got changes/improved offer.  All the paperwork and transfers were managed by make it cheaper and I had one contact throughout it was very easy.  The deal I got was better than the previous years deal.
6030|We have been using Make It Cheaper for some time now, they are always helpful listen to your needs and understand the savings are vital , If saving cant be made they will always give you the best deal for your business.
6031|The quotes provided were clear and concise; the process was explained well and any questions dealt with straight away.  I felt confident in my decision regarding the new gas contract and was given excellent advice regarding the contract-length options.
6032|As a church treasurer I am busy with church activities as well as home issues. It is most welcome to have an organisation prompting you about contract durations, time table for new contracts etc. It is also satisfying that they have all the comparable rates and contracts at their finger tips. This all saves time, money and hassle.
6033|customer service team were able to penetrate the initial frustrated reaction to frequent cold calls all designed to save you money. He was able to quickly and politely remind me my gas contract was near to its end despite the fact that i initially did not believe him , and that i needed to start addressing a new supplier which he then sourced.
6034|Very good results and low pressure sales good for busy businesses who dont want pressure sales calls
6035|saved time in a very busy hectic businesshappy to reccommend
6036|Its a minefield out there but I didn't have to cross it as Make It Cheaper did it for me. Make It Cheaper even answer their phones when you call them unlike most of the energy suppliers out there. I would definitely recommend them to find the best deals for both Commercial and Residential property. 
6037|I found this company via google and they were everything and more that I needed.  My energy contracts were up for renewal and I wasn't sure what to do for the best. One phone call and it was all taken care of with ease. Their representative was so friendly and helpful, and you are able to get straight back to the same person each time by direct line or email.  They will even come back to me next time I nead a deal at the end of the contracts, they handle everything! No more sitting on hold waiting to speak to energy suppliers for me! They are looking at my card machine next and they will also do your business insurance.  I have just had GBP30.00 of M&S; vouchers for referring another business owner; what's not to like about this fabulous company?
6038|Brilliant efficient service to help us switch after over 20 years with the same supplier. After two failed attempts to switch and wasted time and expense, we finally found help to switch efficiently, easily and with excellent communications all the way  
6039|GOOD SERVICE SAVED ME A LOT OF MONEY AND WOULD USE THEM AGAIN
6040|Stress free and very useful service!Recommended
6041|Saved me time getting other quotes, very helpful.
6042|I arrived at Make it cheaper in a round about sort of way but I was so pleased that I had found them, I told them what I was looking for and straight away the young man helped me find the details he needed to do the comparison, in no time at all he had the details of a cheaper rate and gave me all I needed to know to get permission to change. I was able to speak to him again the following day to finalise the change, any questions I had he was able to answer and we went ahead and did the change. I have received a confirmation on the computer and hope to have cheaper electricity in the future
6043|They made choosing energy providers for my business a simple process and saved me time and hassle by doing all the leg work for me and recommending the best deals.
6044|The service I got off was very good in fact it was excellent I shall be looking to use you in over projects in the futures
6045|Excellent service, helped me to save time. 
6046|"A very helpful and understanding agent, explaining how they work and which companies they deal with. Was sympathetic to my experience of having our present supplier phoning and hassling me into extending our contract some 4 months before it expires with their clear 'script' of ""prices going up and this will secure a fixed rate""etc. Agreed with me a 12 month agreement was more sensible at the moment and did not push a long term commitment which I found refreshing. All in all, he seemed genuine in his desire to find me the best deal, and when this was with my existing supplier, he still gave me a better price than the company itself. I was very satisfied."
6047|Got contract name wrong. No help in sorting it out. Had to ring edf energy myself which i should have done to start with.  Had calls from them since to try and sell more services. 
6048|The staff member was not too pushy, I did not feel pressured - which I appreciate. The info on how to close the previous account was useful as I had not switched business electricity supplier before. I saved money, had an easy switch and now look forward to getting the money that the previous supplier has as it is mine!
6049|Could not be more helpful or patient
6050|Great service, saved me lots of time and hassle dealing with cancellation departments and various energy sites to get quotes. The staff know what they are talking about and confidently provided me with a better deal than we currently have in the office with minimal effort from us.Highly recommended!
6051|I have used them for my business, church and home and they are always helpful and save me money without the hassle of remembering to do myself
6052|We were very happy to use Make It Cheaper for the third year in a row.
6053|easy to use hassle free company with no sales pressure, they do exactly as they say they will, they call when the say the will and have found us some fab deals 
6054|top class service from a top class company who exceeded our expectations
6055|I feel as though the sales staff are giving me the best market advise,as they value my return business.
6056|Professional and experienced advisor reduced my potential bills by hundreds of pounds with a bit of luck. 2 years fixed deal for my business with providers I was unaware existed but was reassured by my advisor to feel comfortable proceeding. A good experience.
6057|I was having a new Electric supply fitted to my catering trailer, I had spoken to two different companies and all they did was baffle me with science and sent out a form via email which I didn't understand either. I then found Make It Cheaper, The member of staff I dealt with was Fantastic. Everything was explained to me like I was a 5 year old, lol. They went through every item I was using on electricity, told me what I required got the quotes and bobs your uncle British Gas came out and fitted my new Meter within 10 days. Job Done. Thanks for everything Make it cheaper could not have done it without you. You made it all seem so easy and did all the leg work for me, The Suppliers should take a look at what you do and train their staff the same way so customers like myself can easily understand what KVH and such things are, or single and three phase. You are the bees knees in my book. 
6058|My initial contact was excellent and a really good money saving deal was offered.However the energy supplier rejected the contract 2 weeks ago.I have phoned twice but am still waiting to find out why and how to resolve.
6059|In a business where time is money and saving money on fuel bills is key, the team at Make It Cheaper are fantastic at ensuring I had the best and cheapest supplier and didn't take up too much of my time in arranging the switch.  I have already told people about them and will continue to do so.  I will also be using them again when the electricity supplier contract is up - my company has saved over GBP200/year by switching.
6060|In particular very helpful in explaining 'what happens next'. So often the sales call finished and you have no idea about next steps. MakeitCheaper has it covered!
6061|Great service, from explaining the options & tariffs in great detail, and once agreed no additional paperwork to complete. You also arranged the transfer from the old to the new supplier without any additional hassle on my part. The staff member had a very relaxed manner and was happy to provide an instant answer to any questions I had relating to the switching process.  
6062|There are so many companies out there that seem to promise so much and in the end deliver so little. No so with makeitcheaper.com I left my contact details on their website over Christmas and completely forgot about it. However when the agent called, he was very courteous and clear in what the company could do for me - check the energy suppliers and get me the best deal. The service was outstanding, even sending me a copy of a letter that I needed to forward to my existing supplier to terminate the contract and allowing me to sign an e-contract for the new supplier. All in all, it was quick, hassle free and will save me money. I have recommended this company to my friends and will continue to do so. A big thank you from me.
6063|Excellent service which takes away all the hassle and time wasted in trawling the web for best deals. Very efficient and pleasant sales people to deal with who understand the customers needs. 
6064|Saved Time, Hassle and Money, Great Service, with a helpful team of informed and dedicated operators.
6065|I got into trouble with my gas company not only did they sympathise they helped me organise a payment structure taking the whole hassle away from me forever grateful
6066|ive always used make it cheaper for energy suppliers. I have had various other brokers trying to offer similar deals but make it cheaper consistently find the best deals and their agents are always friendly without being pushy.I would recommend these guys 100%
6067|Having procured energy for a number of years direct with suppliers, I wanted a simple way to ascertain if the contracts I was dealing with offered good value against a central procurement service. I am exceptionally pleased with the results and the savings I make 'going it alone'. Following an initial online survey I was contacted by a man called Josh, straight away I was asked what I was looking for, not bombarded with a pushy sales pitch I knew instantly that I had made the right decision making contact with Make it Cheaper. Josh Grace, who is a Major Business Consultant was excellent, he was very informed about the markets even though I was happy to remain with my incumbent he still provided detailed costs with other suppliers so that I was able to evidence best value. There was no rush to get me signed up or scare mongering that I would lose this price if I didn't act today we have even looked at long term contracts and likelihoods in market fluctuations. I would recommend Make It Cheaper to anyone, try it! it's a no obligation service and if you have to evidence 3 quotes or best value they do it all for you. I will definitely be using this service again.
6068|Friendly, helpful people who save us money every time and saves me having to go through all the various websites trying to see who is offering the best fuel deal.
6069|I needed to find the best supplier for both gas and electricity for commercial premises. Callback within minutes of signing up, a friendly rep walks you through of how it all works and what you can expect to pay. If you don't know much about the market or price levels, they truly save you the hassle of hours of research. They also follow up when your contract is due for renewal. A definite thumbs up.
6070|Very helpful friendly and efficient
6071|In my opinion this is a service which everyone should look at, I found it so easy and not stressful in the slightest. Staff were polite and confident. 5 stars from me and my company
6072|I regret the day you ever phoned me! my switch was one huge mess up that failed miserably.. scottish power applied to early whilst i was still under contract, it got rejected, nobody bothered to tell me, i left it to you guys to sort out, you promised it would all be ok! left me in the lurch and out of contract with british gas.. cost me over GBP300 in extra charges!! scottish power dont want to know and are now billing me GBP850 for a service they never provided! had this confimed by MPAS that my supply has never left british gas... Scottish power broke their terms of our switching contract by applying too early and now I am fighting to get an GBP850 bill from them removed! when i have been paying british gas for the service all the time! I wish i never bothered even trying to switch, I am out of pocket, stressed out, no better off than before and in a far worse situation!Follow up:Just received a phone call from Make It Cheaper ... who have kindly listened to my initial sales call and can confirm that the details I provided them with were correct (I already knew that.. I can read a contract) However their sales operative entered the date incorrectly into their system... NOW just to point out that all paperwork received by myself had all the correct dates on so i have been oblivious to the impending mess up...They are prepared to offer me GBP300 compensation for their mistake that has left me out of pocket, stressed out and not a happy little bunny.. HOWEVER, now wait heres the kick in the balls...ONLY if i am prepared to switch supply through them.. something I am not prepared to do so I dont get any compensation for being out of pocket for their mistake.Remember the name folks... MAKE IT CHEAPER.....
6073|I phoned them about a rate and I informed them I will be checking other providers..we get a call a few hours later from some sales guy really pushy and rude.In my opinion a reputable company should not use such sales tactics!Funny thing is I was going to use them but really the sales guy was unbearable. 
6074|They rang me because my contract with another supplier was due for renewal. Gave them all the details and the 'best' price they could offer me was almost 10% more expensive than quotes I had already received by going direct to suppliers. What a waste of a lengthy phone call.
6075|I cannot believe the savings you will make our club, These savings will go straight back in to providing better equipment for the youth at the club.
6076|I am Secretary of a local watersports club and was looking to change dual energy suppliers because of unsatisfactory energy rates offered by the club's existing supplier.  Although an amateur watersports club, our club is classed as a business for energy supply purposes.  I anticipated a lot of hassle and paperwork to change supplier but the whole experience was practically effortless.  I was quickly quoted two new energy suppliers together with choice of tariffs and after decision made, the paperwork was conducted on-line.The whole exercise (by telephone) was unbelievably easy and I was subsequently kept up to date during the whole changeover process. My supplier was changed in 6 days! I have the additional bonus of being able to conduct the club's energy contract on-line, something I was unable to do with the previous supplier.As a busy club secretary, a wonderful experience of efficiency.           
6077|I am starting out in business for the first time and do not have a clue about whether I am going to pay more than my competitors for my services.Luckily, I found 'Make it Cheaper' who got me electricity for half the price the original supplier was proposing and a phone line with internet for an amazing price. In addition to this they made other suggestions to make the future potentially run smoother. All of this advice is invaluable but on the downside they could not find a water supplier for me but this is not a problem as it is a heavily regulated industry and the saving of switching would be small.
6078|Good experience! All agents we spoke to were very helpful and quickly sorted out best deal for us.
6079|Saves time and money and takes the hassle out of finding the best deals for utility suppliers. Always courteous and answer the phone quickly. Knowledgable and phone you when you are coming to the end of contract and a better deal is available.
6080|Most of my contracts is through Make it cheaper. good to be reminded in advance of any contract runs out and get variety of different coatetion
6081|Dealing with business contracts can be more difficult than a domestic electricity contract.  I was previously with British Gas, and had a tie in period and a standing charge and variable rate that I did not really know if it was good value for money.  It was only when I had a renewal letter that I decided to see if there were any companies specializing with business contracts.  What made me use you was a number of factors:1.  I registered my interest with a number of companies, and you called first, so you had the first opportunity to prove yourself!2.  You asked the key questions that enabled me to make my decisions, i.e. my current rates and renewal rate, tie in period etc.  Within 30 seconds you had a quotation that cut my costs by at least 30% - so this was enough for me not to speak to any other companies3.  You said you could deal with my old supplier and cancel the contract and start up the new one - saving me time and hassle.4.  You explained about direct debit discounts and the overall total cost in a simple informative way, setting out the timescales.  EON have subsequently confirmed all the costs exactly as quoted.5.  You explained if I needed ongoing assistance, your company was my point of contact.Overall every aspect of my contact with you was positive, so I have nothing but positive things to say.  Keep up the good work!
6082|"The agent found us the best possible deals at the time - which far eclipsed the main 6 offers for both gas and electric.One simple phone call from us and they did all the rest.  There was no pressure to sign up at the time, we had time to think about and compare what we had obtained on our own.Would we use these again?  Most definatley - and they will more than likely be my first call.A big thank you for making it simpler & ""make it cheaper""."
6083|The original call received from Make it cheaper, was very informative and helpful.The sales person spoke clearly and explained with great detail what was available with reference to my renewal of electric supply.I had received calls from other utility companies, however they didn't impress and didn't get my business.
6084|Very Happy would use and reccomend again
6085|An easy way to transfer suppliers and save money.  Make it cheaper did all the hard work.  Would definitely recommend.
6086|"Make It Cheaper (MIC) were quick to listen and understand our requirements.  They came back to us quickly with a deal that was significantly better than the one we on.  They could have scored better if they had committed the call and line rental rates plus the key terms and conditions into a single document for ease of reference but this did not happen.  This later led to some confusion about the term of the contract with the new provider.  We had to clarify with the new telecoms provider that the contract was a 30 day rolling notice contract (as agreed verbally with MIC)and not 3 years as indicated in the terms and conditions MIC sent us.As my teachers used to write in my school reports : ""There is room for improvement"""
6087|I found the sales team keen and knowledgeable, about both the tariffs and company's available to me. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend, to others. 
6088|This is the third time I have used your Service, and was impressed by your knowledge of the Market,the helpfulness of your staff, and how quickly everything was arranged.
6089|Great service all round
6090|Extremely professional, able to fully explain the answers to my questions. Called back when they said they would and provided clear ownership for helping the task through to completion. Would recommend without hesitation.       
6091|The ability to arrange the changeover of our electric supply without any problems and save over GBP300 per year for the scout group which means that we have for funds to spend on entertaining the scouts. The helpfulness of the member of staff was excellent Polite and professional  in every manor of the change over, being able to talk me through the process and finding the best prices for the gas and electric and then arranging the direct debts so that there is less paper work for me to prepare every month. Thanks for all the help 17th Lytham St AnnesScouts group 
6092| As you would expect when the renewal for our energy contact came in we shopped around and found what we thought was the cheapest price on the market only to be pleasantly surprised again by Make it Cheaper who had a lower quote. The transfer to the new provider was handled effortlessly and I look forward to another trouble free year with the Make it Cheaper team. The icing on the cake for this particular transaction was being provided with a breakdown of the commission structure that they work to and the amount they would receive as a result of arranging this contract. It is transparency like this that gives me the confidence to recommend them to others in my industry.
6093|Moving premises is always a headache, setting up new electricity and gas accounts is a nightmare.Make it cheaper took all the bother and hassle away from us, and set up new accounts for us really quickly. They even went to the trouble of providing a draft letter to the premises old suppliers so that it was easy to terminate the contacts with them.Absolutely brilliant service. 10 out of 10.
6094|I was advised by agent that all customer services with Extra Energy would be dealt with by Make it Cheaper. When I had difficulty accessing my account I received an email saying it was actually my responsibility. In addition as an excuse this agent claimed having trouble contacting me. I run my business from my mobile telephone and she had no problem calling and leaving messages when trying to get me to choose a provider. I feel mislead by this company and would be wary in trusting their promises in the future.
6095|Excellent service  great friendly staff would recommend to everybody if you want to save money thank you  make it cheaper for saving me money in  my business 
6096|Staff are brilliant. You get what you ask for and in quick, professional manor. They advise you all the options available. They also advise all the small print items in clear and understandable way. They keep you informed about when your contacts are due to end so you can cancel within the time scale set by the companies. They don't hound you either, which is great. I will use them again and would highly recommend anyone to use them.
6097|I was contacted as promised in good time to give notice to change provider. This makes life really easy. The agent was knowledgeable and dealt with the changeover as quickly as he could. The only snag now is I am not happy with the new provider as they have been impossible to contact. Next time I will change back and consider the ease of contacting the supplier over saving a few pounds.
6098|easy using, but I miss the overview of the tariffs.friendly service staffproblems to use the internet registration.private and in our business, we think were by the right supplier
6099|Long winded but pretty good service and although I put it off til the last minute it saves trawling through the minefield of tarrifs and whilst maybe not the very cheapest deal in the end you at least know youre not paying over the odds. Its also a useful reminder that your old deal is running out to prevent you defaulting to high price standard tarrifs
6100|Hassle free easy transition of contract make this a one stop shop for changing your energy provider, nobody could have done this better than the team at make it cheaper
6101|Excellent professional service from staff who know what they are doing. Emails and queries answered promptly and with useful information... would not hesitate to recommend this company.
6102|I had been thinking of changing service provider for a while but struggled to find  the time to look investigate further.  Joseph called from Make It Cheaper and went through my options with me.  He made the whole process easy from start to end.  He has helped me make a saving of around 50 per cent on my monthly bills.Fantastic service from start to finish.
6103|As above, a great way to save time and money. Staff knew their products and saved me the time of having to call multiple companies to get lots of quotes.
6104|I have used Make it Cheaper for a number of years now and I genuinely believe they they are a very useful tool in keeping our energy prices at the cheapest price for our business needs.  They offer the information in idiot proof sentences!!  They then contact you when your current contract is ready for renewing so ensuring you don't roll over into a more expensive contract because you forgot to contact current energy provider.  Very simple and easy service to use totally recommend.  
6105|I thought it was going to be hard to find suitable gas and electricity tariffs for our charity which uses it premises for only a couple of hours on five days each week. The makeitcheaper agent led us to just the right products for our needs. The service was friendly and helpful throughout. And to my amazement we were told exactly how much commission makeitcheaper would receive. 
6106|very good and helpful staff
6107|Received a unbeatable fantastic renewal quote. No other broker could come anywhere near the renewal quote I received. Highly recommend.
6108|Received a call regarding my renewal. Advisor was helpful and efficient. Did not waste my time or his and renewed my contract online whilst on the phone. Couldn't have asked for more.I would recommend this service to friends and family.
6109|Prompt service and hassle free. Was a fact filled call, everything explained and a quick switch. This is the second time I have used this company.
6110|I am a one person business who is inundated with daily calls from people trying to sell me gas and electricity.  I am confident that by using Make it Cheaper I get a good deal with very little hassle. I know my contract will be changed in time and that they will do their best to get me a good deal.  Knowing I don't have to worry is worth a lot but I am pretty confident I am also getting a good price on my gas and electricity in fact last time my gas price went down!My only tiny gripe is they always try to get me to move my phone too but I have chosen my phone contract on ethical grounds and don't want to move however the sales people don't push too hard so its ok.
6111|Good experience with professional, well mannered and knowledgeable staff. 
6112|Gas and electricity supply for new office premises sorted in one quick and easy phone call. The team were able to offer a range of deals and find the ones that best suited our needs, 
6113|The sales person who contacted us was very helpful and knowledgeable and made the whole process very easy and we understood everything with ease.  
6114|Good service, Intelligent polite staff. Little time spent to achieve target goal i.e. cost cutting.  
6115|make it cheaper make it cheaper easier and quickergood company to work with they take the hassle out of remembering when your contracts need renewed, and then  they make it easy to access the best deal and switch you supply.
6116|Very happy with the service, nothing to fault. The adviser did a great job finding me the best insurance for the business. Best price for value I could get.
6117|When you're setting up a business, there are 101 things to do and not enough time to do them in! Using Make it Cheaper to source the best deals for me has been a very good experience and has saved me hours of phone calls and wasted admin time as well as saving my business money. I would recommend the service to anyone, either domestic or business. Thanks!Make it Cheaper doesn't just concentrate on Electricity and energy supply, they also help me with my Telecoms requirements too! Thanks!
6118|As a small family run retail business we were delighted to be introduced to the team at 'Make it Cheaper'.  They took all the tedious, time consuming hassle out of finding the cheapest and best option for us as a business and as an added bonus - saved us money too.  Once the best option had been found, it took just one phone call and two e-mails to sort the whole thing. One gentle e-mail reminder to cancel our existing contract by e-mail too so once you they have helped you, there is no constant bombardment from them. We didn't have to remember to call them again after the first year, they called in time for the expiry of our existing contract with new options all ready for us and presented clearly.  Wonderful, efficient service. 
6119|Make It Cheaper has made the process of renewing energy supplier and being confident of the best rates so much easier.  The staff member I spoke to was very knowledgeable and explained the different tariffs to me clearly.  I would definitely recommend.
6120|The service was extremely efficient, professional and has saved me not only money but also a lot of time and hassle. Even when there were problems with installation these were dealt with in a timely and professional manner. 
6121|I was wary of getting involved at first but my broker, has been so professional and I have complete faith that I am getting the best deal - and I am not an easy person to convince.  The whole situation has been hassle free, and when my phone contract and insurance come up for renewal, I will certainly let Make It Cheaper take the stress out of finding the best deals for me.
6122|I have used Make it cheaper quite a lot now both for business and personal bills. They have saved huge amounts for me and my club. The telecoms specialist has been superb as have all teh staff. The recommend options which really suit my needs and have great conmmunication. If you haven't tried them you are missing out.
6123|Finding the time to compare individual business packages is difficult. Make it cheaper did this for us and hopefully everything will transfer smoothly.When starting this process you need to get all the information together beforehand-12 months bills from each supplier, to give accurate information for the new quotes to be based on.At the time of writing this review no transfers have taken place yet, but I don't anticipate any problems.
6124|Very quick and easy to get quotes. I told the sales rep all the details, and he did the legwork shopping around. Anything I wasn't happy about, they tweaked the quote. Then the following year, they'd held all my info on file so had shopped around and compared to my renewal quote before even contacting me with a proposal. It's hard to do price comparison stuff for businesses, and Make it Cheaper do it very efficiently. There's never any pressure and they explain everything in plain English.
6125|The service received from the consultant was straightforward and thorough.  We stayed with our incumbent supplier and made a saving although not as much as initially expected as the quote I accepted did not reach the supplier in time due to a computer problem. 
6126|It's refreshing to find an Internet company who care more for customers than the highest commissions. The salesman was knowledgeable, clear and practical in the use of his time and mine. To the extent that I have taken time out of my day to thank them. From first contact to completion everything was done in a very professional and confident way. He offered not only choices but also recommended and gave reasons for this. A total pleasure to deal with. Thanks again
6127|As you certified book-keeper many of my clients rely on me to help them with changing their tariffs on gas/elect etc and having one contact at make it cheaper would be better for me.  As time is precious and I do receive telesales calls all the time it would be nice to know that when ? rings me from make it cheaper I know that it is not a sales pitch but a genuine person that I wish to speak to.
6128|The team was very good and helpful
6129|a good service professional and friendly,good knowledge of what product would fit my needs. it was free from the constant phone calls pressureising to make decisions before i'd even read the small print.! good stuff.
6130|The sales agent seemed genuinely interested in our business and the fact that we are a very low electricity user.
6131|I've used Make It Cheaper for the past two years for both Business Insurance and Gas / Electric and really can't get cheaper, there savings go into thousands for our company.Brill friendly, helpfull staff, keep up the good work.
6132|"Good communication on change over of service but no one told me of the slight ""down time"" of the broadband signal on change over.  Seems obvious now that there will be some loss of service but at the time it was annoying as I thought there was something wrong."
6133|The people I spoke to at MIC were very helpful and got me a great deal very quickly. The person I spoke to was knowledgeable, friendly and very efficient in identifying what I needed. Unfortunately, the company I ended up with - XLN Telecom -have STILL not connected my broadband after almost a month. The phone line was connected this week ( after a lot of messing about by BT- not XLN's fault) but they still have to supply the broadband which was the key thing we needed. So, in summary, it would have been useful to have information about the expected performance of different providers, not just the cost. BUT I would still recommend MIC and use them in other instances.
6134|Very organised ,they really do want to save you money I usually don't believe anyone who says I can get you the same product  for less, that is until I got a call from one of make it cheaper,s  agents at no cost to myself they did most of the work to find me the best deals,at no time under any pressure to make the change but the amount of money they did save me ,I would be a fool not to have taken there advise,many thanks make it cheaper! 
6135|Thank you for advising me on my business insurance, you was the only company who wasn't pushy, you knew your stuff, as I am a niche you recommended to put certain aspects in my policy. No one else did that! Thank you for your easy process to purchasing business insurance, the first time I have purchased business insurance and I will definitely be back in the future. Shout out to Adnan who dealt with my service.
6136|I received a call before the contract was up for renewal and given several options. The call did not take long and the staff member was a joy to talk with. Very good and very efficient and saved me money. I am very happy with MakeItCheaper and will recommend to my other contacts. There was nothing I did not like about the call and the way it was conducted.
6137|Full off useful advice, highly reccomended
6138|Get It Cheaper gave us a good price for our gas supply beating all other quotes. They are going to contact us automatically when our electricity contract comes up for renewal.They explained very clearly who they were and what they could do.We are saving around GBP200 per annum on our gas bill.The lady I spoke to phoned me back to get the further details needed.Everything was confirmed in writing within a couple of days of our telephone call. We then had the option whether to switch or not. We have now received the first bill which is very clear. An excellent service.
6139|Energy switching is my worst nightmare as it can be so confusing The advisor made it very simple to switch by fully explaining the various options and giving me time to make a decision by calling me back later on in the day. I ended up staying with the same energy supplier, however secured a much better and cheaper deal so would definitely recommend these guys.
6140|Saved GBP500+ in gas and over GBP300 in electric with one phone call! Brilliant! I didn't have to do a thing, the guy on the phone (Ewan?)sorted everything out for me. FANTASTIC, thank you.
6141|I have used Make It Cheaper for a number of years now, They are so easy to talk to and cheerful! No more wasted hours of searching for the best deals, no more constantly repeated questions about your energy tariff, no more going through endless boring facts that I don't or want to understand only to be told by a monotone grumble at the end of a 1/2 hour phone call that their company can't really do any better and above all no more going through 100's of different options followed by hash...BBBBBooooooorrring! Make it Cheaper have cheerful , helpful staff who do want to make a difference to your life....BRILLIANT!
6142|punctual and friendly phoned back when the said they would,would recommend to other companies and people I know
6143|Thanks to the fantastic, free, impartial services of Make It Cheaper, we have saved more than GBP1000 over the next 2 years. Very very happy :) We would recommend them to everyone wanting to save some dosh.
6144|I received an excellent and friendly service and would definitely recommend to others.
6145|was more than happy to let make it cheaper advise me on best deal available, and saved me hours on the phone. dealt with them before and was very satisfied. Being a charity we are always on look out for money saving ideas
6146|I cannot recommend Make it Cheaper enough.  There is no hard sale.  No annoying repetitive calls. No smarmy Salesman.  Just good honest reliable information.  Have told friends and other businesses about Make It Cheaper and I never do that without good reason
6147|I was treated in a very professional manner by a very cheerful lady who rang me 4days in a row at times convenient for me to help me through each stage of sorting out gas and electric to a listed building with shared services, she made it so easy and the questions she couldn't answer she sorted straight away with help from her colleagues and manager. i liked that she was patient and human and seemed to actually enjoy helping me, I will recommend this company to my family and friends from the experience I have had-and I saved a great deal of money!
6148|My insurance was due and I got the call from Make It Cheaper.  Unfortunately that was the last call until after the due date, therefore I took out a policy with another company.I then got emails asking me to cancel the policy and take out the Make It Cheaper one!!  They then turned to begging emails.  Sorry but you lost my trade, just not reliable enough for me.
6149|I have been pestered by this company, they no not listen. I have told them I have no desire to speak with them and not to phone again, then they do, they speak over you whilst reading from a script. The last time ( Two minutes ago) I had to shout at the girl to stop her talking and listen. I have requested no further contact (I await to see)     
6150|"Successfully reduced our renewal cost with the same supplier that they found for us two years ago!Used to have ""doubts"" over these firms but would not hesitate to recommend Make it Cheaper to anybody!They have consistently saved us money and thus enabled us (a Charity) to make more efficient use of our funds!"
6151|Proved to be good and useful time albeit some of the detail could have been quite difficult but Staff member was very good at keeping it light and informative.
6152|I was told about Make it cheaper about a year ago and they have helped make the switch for the church energy suppliers and phone very easy and simple. Thoroughly recommend them for any church or business that needs to make a change.
6153|Make It Cheaper helped our business to achieve a 20% reduction in insurance premiums with better policy coverage.
6154|"Well folks.  Yet again Make It Cheaper has worked magic for us and been able to reduce our annual Gas bills.  Even in the current climate where utility bills for domestic and commercial use is on the up with some horrific % increases, Make It Cheaper has managed to ""Make It Cheaper!  Definitely worth chatting to one of their team to see what they can do for you.The process was very easy and having dealt with them for a number of years now, they have an in depth knowledge of our Company's requirements, and the personal touch and continuity of an Accounts Manager, where a business relationship occurs.I am looking forward to reviewing our Electric and Landlines with Make It Cheaper and making savings on these costly overhead bills, therefore increasing Net Profit.Thanks again."
6155|Have been plagued with calls from this company. Make sure you get other quotes outside this company. They are to pushy for you to commit to a contract and they most definitely are not the cheapest!
6156|I have been dealing with Make It Cheaper for a number of years and have always found them to be excellent.  As a self employed bookkeeper I use them to negotiate contracts for a variety of my clients and have saved thousands of pounds for my clients over the years. Their service is always efficient, polite and courteous.  I find it hard to fault this company.
6157|Very easy to understand and use; provided after service and assistance when current utility provider did not confirm receipt of termination correspondence.
6158|I love the fact that this service finds the best prices, which saves me time and effort. 
6159|Time is money, the comparison was completed very quickly and we did not have to spend time dealing with our current provider since Make It Cheaper dealt with that too.  Friendly staff with no hard sell, they let the products and figure speak for themselves  We would highly recommend this service to our clients, colleagues, friends and family.
6160|make it cheaper makes it easy.  I always dreaded renewal time and having to compare prices from different suppliers and now I don't have to!
6161|Sales force to pushy, not open enough with the prices or terms
6162|Very easy to switch over to new energy suppliers. As a children's nursery, we educate the children to be more eco friendly and our new supplier is much greener than our former supplier. Being greener doesn't mean more expensive.  We have managed to make a significant saving and our makeitcheaper adviser managed to find us the energy supplier that suited our business. He was incredibly patient answering my every question and explaining all the different facilities available to us. Very happy and I've used makeitcheaper for other utility bills for my business and at home.
6163|Have to say I have used Make it cheaper for a few years now and they perform well each year.  Always offer me a good deal and explain how it will happen.  All very efficient, but with a friendly touch.  Good to do business with.
6164|Once we had agreed which contract we wanted the staff at Make It Cheaper worked through the online forms with us step by step and we were able to complete the contract and return it to them, online, in a very short space of time.  Excellent service and so impressed I've already used them to switch on another property.
6165|One phone call and I have everything I need to make an informed choice for my business without any pressure.  All the documentation arrives in super speedy time to enable me to make the switch. Follow up questions are quickly answered - and they get the nod from everyone's favourite money saving guru.
6166|As my contract for electricity with EDF was coming to an end, I had no hesitation in calling up Make it Cheaper for a bit of advice on who to switch to.   They were brilliant as usual and arranged everything for me.   In the space of about 15 minutes, I had a contract with a new supplier, at better rates and instructions and template letter regarding termination of the former supplier.Make It Cheaper takes out the hassle of comparing rates and going through the process of waiting on the phone for ages to the utilities.As a busy person, I appreciate their assistance in all areas.Keep up the good work.
6167|so easy and simple to change just sent one letter to cancel contract and all done.what isn't to like ? saving money at no extra cost  and all the work done for me 
6168|Spoke to an advisor who seem to know his stuff. He very quickley found a selection of better tarifs on my business electricity. He took care of all of the paperwork, and sent me a template to use in order to inform my current supplier thatI wished to terminate my contract.The only thing I had to do was post it!All very easy!!
6169|We find that reviewing our energy renewal options using Make it Cheaper has become automatic. One phone call to our contact is all it takes to get a market review and effective comparison of costs  for the future supply, saving us a great deal of time, and also money!!
6170|We find that reviewing our energy renewal options using Make it Cheaper has become automatic. One phone call to our contact is all it takes to get a market review and effective comparison of costs  for the future supply, saving us a great deal of time, and also money!!
6171|A quick simple process that resulted in saving around GBP250 pa on electricity.
6172|Always come up with a good deal. Staff are knowledgeable and happy to explain the process. We have saved hundreds of pounds on our church gas & electricity bills over the past few years by using Makeitcheaper every time the contract is due for renewal.
6173|Great service with no hassle ,job done
6174|I liked the fact that it was easy, quick and straightforward. We ended up staying with the same supplier but getting a better deal. 
6175|The best customer service and best deal provider. You always make it easy to your client and give them your best.I have nothing to say bad about you guys just keep it up.I will be happy to recommend to any one so that they can benefit and save money.
6176|Make it cheaper helped me to gain the best possible deal for my company having previously been duped and tied into a contract which was not the best for the company I was glad of the clear and consise information provided to me and the benefits that I would received by changing
6177|No pressure whatsoever
6178|Will always use your company, excellent staff explain everything.Thank you.
6179|its very helpfull when you are very busy
6180|Not 'pushy', helpful and made my decisions easier. I'm deciding for a church and every penny counts. Phoned back at the time they said they would. At the end of the day I felt I had had good service and at the best prices that were available.
6181|Renewing both gas and electricity contracts was extremely easy and completed over the phone in 10 minutes.They searched, using my criteria, what suited us best and introduced us to some great, money saving deals.
6182|I use make it cheaper for insurance and energy.  The guys in the insurance team are fantastic and really helpful however the energy team can sometimes be a bit pushy.  Haven't tried any other services yet but may do in the future.
6183|Make it Cheaper offers a very good service.  They identify the best tariff to match the needs of the customer.  They monitor the contract noting the end date and notify the customer of critical dates for sending cancellation letters. They 'do the leg work' of looking for the best deals for a new contract.  They undertake the administration to effect any change in supplier.Staff are very helpful in explaining relevant matters over the telephone. There are not any downsides to the process that I have come across.  
6184|It took one week to switch over,Highly recommend.
6185|very relieved at how easy and simple this was made for me!
6186|Great sales pitch terrible after service no contact with new provider and the team don't return calls
6187|"I found ""Make it Cheaper"" by searching the internet.Delighted with the results on both the Charity's utilities charges and insurance charges.  We are now saving money versus that which we would have had we not switched.I heartly recommend ""Make it Cheaper""."
6188|At first I was a little dubious as I was 'cold called' after phoning BT to enquire about installing an additional internet line.  The first gentleman I spoke to could hardly speak English and was reading from a flow-chart.  I was then transferred to 2 other consultants who asked for the same information until I got to yet another consultant who then gave me prices on what I needed.  I have to admit they were half the price of BT.  Everything has switched over this morning so I can't comment on the speed.  The only negative is that there was no technical support on how or where to install the router.
6189|Our representative was not only helpful and polite she really tried to understand our needs and consider our future plans, not simply what was best for here and now. Regular contact ensured we received up to date prices and quotes and the whole process of switching was relatively painless and simple.  Will definately use your services again
6190|The staff member reviewed the existing Electricity bills sent via e-mail & offered a selection of better deals which we agreed to.We assume the changeover in September will be seamless.
6191|Took all the grief away from trawling around the web for a clear business electricity price.  Staff were polite, clear and knowledgeable.  I was not pressured into buying a particular service and could have chosen an alternative.  I was simply given the best available options to suit my requirements.  My questions were answered concisely and I was given direct phone line contact to the person I'd been speaking to.   Yes, you will spend a little time on the phone going though your details and requirements, but you only do it once.  I will definitely go back to them for other product quotes.
6192|I must admit I was a little sceptical at first - however, the service and clear conversation was completely refreshing.  I will not hesitate to use the service again and will recommend to others.  My faith has been restored in these type of companies.
6193|The site is very easy to negotiate.  Explanations are clear.  Price comparisons are accurate when compared with other sites.  In short, no fuss, just what you want!  I would recommend the site to others with confidence.  Good chance will use again if need to.
6194|Have just used Make it Cheaper to change tariffs with existing gas company.  No too sure about all the telephone calls from them appear that they 'hounding' you on a regular basis; otherwise very polite sales people
6195|very good and efficient service. They are always friendly and explain all aspects of the transaction in detail.
6196|Easy proceedure with helpful staff. Savings generated.
6197|Make it cheaper were easy to deal with. Good guidance throughout.
6198|Great customer service, honest and transparent process.
6199|Pushy salesman who in the end couldn't offer me a good deal anyway accuses me of wasting his time and slams the phone in my face.If this is the quality of the sales pitch I don't want to experience their customer services.
6200|The process of getting a change of tariff  satisfactory but I suppose your employee did not appreciate aParochial Church Council has charitable status even though it may not be a registered charity. He kept trying to find High Wych PCC on the Charity Register.I have received confirmation from the supplier that the new tariff will be in place at the appropriate date.
6201|Make it Cheaper really took the annoyance and drama of switching suppliers out of the equation.  Quick, simple, easy and friendly service.Would definitely recommend.
6202|happy with the service, liked that I could get all the documents signed online. Overall no complaints
6203|you could do this yourself if you've the time to research it but it's all done for you & at no cost. I'd have preferred to have been able to read terms & conditions instead of/in addition to having them read to me. The thing I managed to latch onto & clarify was new contract would become rolling for another year if not renewed or cancelled within new supplier's required notice period BEFORE contract end date. Whilst MIC will undoubtedly ring to renew, I've set up my own reminder to cancel. This is out third utility change arranged with MIC so yes, we'd recommend them.
6204|Four months prior to the renewal date of the contract I would constantly get phone calls, sometimes twice a day asking me to what I was going to do; this is unacceptable.  Only when I said I was going to involve the authorities as this was tantamount to harassment that the calls stopped, however this took a couple of months for the notes to be put onto my account.  When working full time this kind of behavior is not acceptable.If upon the next renewal date I receive the same harassing phone calls, I will take my complaints further.When I did eventually speak to a young man, he was very helpful and apologetic for the poor service that Id received.
6205|"The speed at which the T & Cs are read out, is it imperative for your customer to hear (and understand) everything about this sometimes garbled interlude?Are you putting your staff under extra pressure to complete ""a deal""?I must point out that it is not only your company to which the above comments apply.All in all I have found your staff competent and well mannered.

6206|We are pleased to have had all the work done for us in finding the best deal for our business.  We don't have the time to phone around ourselves, so were happy to leave this to someone else.
6207|Effortlessly explained and set up with new contracts simpleWould recommend
6208|30 seconds was all it took to answer the phone and be talked through a money-saving deal. The process was simple, transparent and took less than 10 minutes (max) to save a lot of money ! Good job !
6209|Be careful! There was no time allowed to change my mind. I wanted to cancel an hour later but apparently the terms and conditions read to me over the phone stated something about a GBP150 fine if I cancelled. The T&C; were read so fast I probably missed lots of other information too. Customer services were unsympathetic and didn't care. Locked into something I don't want for two years now. 
6210|Excellent service.  Gave them a very tight deadline to meet, which they did, and saved money.
6211|"The speed at which the T & Cs are read out, is it imperative for your customer to hear (and understand) everything about this sometimes garbled interlude?Are you putting your staff under extra pressure to complete ""a deal""?I must point out that it is not only your company to which the above comments apply.All in all I have found your staff competent and well mannered. I  have dealt with your company on many occasions on behalf of the Charity for which I am Treasurer and have always found them courteous - on occasions interspersed with a sense of humour - and dedicated."
6212|We have used make it cheaper on three occasions and presently considering a further provider change. Their approach is professional which I fail to understand is not true of other companies in the market place. They take on board your specific comments and concerns and provide you with products that suit your needs, whilst still giving the cheapest offers in the market - so you can further rationalise your choice!Personally I like the way make it cheaper do business and to date have been very satisfied with their customer service and also the providers which we have changed to?
6213|I found this a really good service, especially as Make It Cheaper called me so I didn't even have to do any research myself. The different options were explained very clearly and it made my decision easy. My views on different energy companies were also listened to and taken into account (even my rant about my previous supplier!)
6214|Glad we chose Make It Cheaper - Found website by chance - so helpful and polite. Most of all they listen to what you require. Would definitely recommend to others. 
6215|Not bad - would recommend this Service to other businesses.
6216|This is at least the third time that I have used Make it Cheaper.  At my request 'Make it cheaper' now contacts me when a new contract is due - what a bonus no more chance of finding the renewal date has passed and I am locked into an outrageous increase in payment.The MIC representative listens carefully to my needs, e.g. no standing charge as no gas is used for at least 4 months of the year, and then advises of suitable alternatives having already researched suitable possibilities.Having agreed a deal it then advises how we should proceed, notifies and sets up the contract with the new supplier and also sends you a draft letter of contract termination to our current supplier for you to complete and send. It is there to support if any difficulties or queries occur through the life of the contract.Hence Make it cheaper - never better!
6217|Helped me reduce my previous quote by 2/3.Very helpful service and communication. Will definateley use again for my other utility contracts. Will definateley suggest to others.
6218|not much to say. The company did it,s job in a polite unhurried way. thanks
6219|They call you to save you money - what could be worse!
6220|Received helpful advise as to the options available and given time to consult with the Committee to get their views. 
6221|Really good and totally efficient service, very impressed.  Have used make it cheaper many times before and always got really good service
6222|As a charity, we have to be especially careful with the money that we spend. Make It Cheaper were very helpful and extremely professional. Just keeping things as they are when cheaper alternatives are easily available is not really an option. I would very much recommend using Make It Cheaper to other institutions, and will be using them again when my household utilities are up for renewal.
6223|They listened to my specific issues and were completely frank about the savings that I could, or could not make. I was dealing with a supplier who was very competative but inflexible. I was put onto one that had the flexibility I needed and without any financial penalty. If I have any issues in the future I am assured that the customer service team will assist in the resolution.It was refreshing to find ssomeone who genuinely seemd interested in finding the correct solution to my problems.
6224|We have been using Make it Cheaper for anything we can as not only do they do exactly what they promise, but they make it so easy too!They wont make you change for the sake of it either, if you already have the best deal, they will say that and advise you to stick with what you already have. I used to struggle to compare what deal we already had to other suppliers until I called Make it Cheaper and they did it all for me. You don't even have to understand fully as you simply tell them what you need and they will work it out for you. I recently had a call to say that my energy contract was almost up and that they had new quotes for me, they advised me that it would be cheaper to switch again and how exactly. I agreed that I would like to make the switch, they explained exactly what would happen and then all I had to do was sign and agree! Another years contract at a cheaper rate, very happy customer. Thank you.
6225|Simple,accurate and seemed to find the best switch for my energy requirements.Process was very simple. Just have your details to hand regarding your annual energy consumption and tap in.
6226|They make what can be an awkward process (changing energy supplier or getting good rates with existing supplier) as easy as it can be.  It is a pain of a job but I will always use them as it makes me get it done and I have never had them beaten on price.  Thanks!
6227|Very helpful people on the phone... you'd be crazy not to use MIC to cut costs.I started with business energy and found it so easy I also now use them for my domestic energy and even a charity for which I work (and which needs to save every penny it can!)Only downside I have found so far is the GBP1,000 saving guarantee, as they seem to expect you to fill in pages and pages of detailed information which they already have about all the services they are providing to you
6228|I was given the wrong information to switch over to another energy company when it is not true. Not only I would not save any money but it would cost me more in energy bill and will have to pay the exit fee for breaking the contract. NOT HAPPY
6229|Quick, simple and straight to the point, found the best deal so I didn't have to worry about it!! But were simple to deal with and cut out the hassle instead of creating more like some that I have dealt with.  Would recommend to anyone and don't get to say that very often.  Would definitely use again without hesitation.
6230|The member of staff was extremly helpful and contacted us with all the information we needed, we was really pleased with the results.
6231|I couldn't believe how easy this was to do and how much I have saved. I couldn't find any fault.
6232|good enough good enough good
6233|I felt i was treated very well and was explained the process clearly. It didnt take a very long time. I just sat back while the change happened. i can highly recommend make it cheaper. 
6234|From start to finish transferring my energy supplier was made very easy by the knowledgeable, friendly staff at make it cheaper. I saved over 300 quid of my annual energy bill which is great as margins are very tight for my business. I would recommend make it cheaper to any household or small business customers 
6235|This was the first time I dealt with make it cheaper.  I have to say a very satisfying and reassuring experience!  They explained the business tariffs so clearly. Very easy to understand and as a company policy they do not favour any one energy companies. So they really do look for the best deal for you! I was expecting to pay about 1p more per kw as I had done a lot of enquiries with the big 6! However, make it cheaper managed to reduce my tariff by almost 1p per kw, which is a massive saving for our company.Also, what I liked was the quotation that was said to me, whilst I was on the phone they emailed me in writing exactly what they offered! I have experiences in the past where the tariff is not always the same when your contract comes through.Overall, a pleasant experience, easily explained, no complicated jargon and I thought very honest.  I will definitely be returning to make it cheaper! Nothing negative to write about!
6236|Dealing with one company who will go out into the marketplace and secure the best deal for us makes it so much easier for us. It allows us to get on and do what we do best.I have been dealing with Make it Cheaper for a while now and all the staff I have dealt with have been helpful and friendly and I have always felt they have worked for our interests not the energy suppliers interests.It makes sense for us to have all our contracts with Make it Cheaper even if they are with multiple energy suppliers, it means I don't have to worry about end of contract dates as I am notified automatically and the cheapest/best deal is found for me.
6237|"It couldn't be any quicker or more convenient. The online ""signing of your contract"" is a real time-saver."
6238|When you are busy running a business it is too easy to let energy contracts run on and for the price to creep up. Make it cheaper made changing supplier very easy and I have been delighted with the savings over the last twelve months. Trusting a voice over the phone and giving financial details was a big step but it appears that my trust was justified and I will certainly use them again.
6239|The perfect deals always help you to acheive your perfect target. With the help from `Make it Cheaper` not only are we able to access the best deals for our charities but we don`t have to lose our time doing it.
6240|I got through on the phone virtually immediately. It was really easy to compare electricity prices and find who is currently doing the best deals. The guy on the phone was very friendly and concise and seems to be on my wavelength from the start .The prices he quoted were cheaper than those I got directly from the energy firms themselves. It's a bit of a no-brainer why you couldn't use this term to cut your electricity bills. The switching process was quick and easy too. They sent me a template to fill-in and send to my current supplier to inform them that I didn't want to renew my contract. All I have to do now is watch my business says over GBP400 compared to last year!
6241|Ive now used Make It Cheaper for the past, erm, at least 3 years. I am contacted when a contract is about to end and I am confident that the best deal is then put before me. Were it not for that, wed probably have just continued using the same provider. It's one less thing for me to remember to do, plus I get the credit from the directors for making the savings! 
6242|I am disgusted in the phone customer service I had today as I was unsure who these people where that called me and then to tell me that I cannot stay with my current electricity company because I want to pay more and dont agree with going with a different provider, I found it arogent and rude.
6243|TOTAL DISGRACE CONN ARTISTS 100S EMAILS CALLS ETC AND STILL NO REFUND
6244|"These days (especially for us older folks) personal service wins. Being able to talk to the same person almost every time and to be able to reach that person fairly quickly and as often as you need (as opposed to getting constant calls, and answering machines with"" press * for"" in short getting looked after personally is a very attractive proposition.                 "
6245|Advisers obviously very well trained. My case was not straight forward and the adviser handled it very well,even putting me on hold whilst he checked something he was unsure about.This resulted in only 1 phone conversation to complete the deal.
6246|"I have had a number of telephone calls from people who have told me that my contract is due to expire and I must act straight away. This has been incorrect. One man told me that he worked for Make It Cheapers sister company and that he had set up the last contract which was lies. It took one call to your office to reassure me that all was o.k. I have just renewed with you again. Thank you. The above is my wife's review.  She became upset when obviously one of ""make it cheaper""'s competitors were trying to hoodwink her by pretending to be who they were not.She has had nothing but good experiences with ""make it cheaper"" and has no intention of leaving them. :)"
6247| I just filled out the online form and within 15 minutes I had an agent on the phone. By the next day I had many quotes and was signed up with the best of them by the end of that day. Awesome service, I cannot fault you!I can honestly say there was not anything that I did not like about the service. It was second to none and I would recommend that all new businesses looking to reduce there overall costs to come here. I have had other agents on the phone badgering me but felt its best to source my own compare company and I am glad I did. 
6248|I would not hesitate to recommend Make It Cheaper not only are they saving me money it was an efficient friendly service with little input from me they oversaw the change over with no hassles whatsoever with thanks Stuart Brearley
6249|I received a call from Make it Cheaper yesterday morning as I was about to leave the house for an appointment. I could not get a word in to explain I didn't have time or arrange to make a more convenient time. I was talked over the whole phone call. This seriously is not a good way to do business. I am happy to listen to genuine deals. This may well be a wonderful organisation that does save the customer money. But you need to give the customer time to check and compare with their current fuel supplier before forcing them to change suppliers. I really did not appreciate the forcefulness of the salesperson at all. It has put me off changing. There are so many gimmicks and dodgy deals, that all customers have a right to check into details before signing up for anything. Please let the customer do this. You need to listen!!!!!!!
6250|you receive a phone call saying we can offer cheaper electricity. So they start to speak non stop & you cant get a word in. All you want to do is get off the phone because you are sick of there constant pushing for you to agree to change to another company. If you reply i would rather stay with my current supplier they do not take any notice & basically tell you to change over.The company is just so pushy that it is off putting not giving you time to compare other companies. 
6251|I really could not fault the service, and help I received. And look forward to receiving a contact in November concerning renewal of property insurance.
6252|These people were extremely helpful.  We knew we were paying a lot and they helped us to update all our energy suppliers for home and business, we also changed our telephone and internet providers with their help.  In fact, we just gave them the information and they did all the comparisons and dealt with the switchovers... so easy!  Thank you.
6253|We have used Make It Cheaper for many years now for most of our business costs. They have only failed once to beat what we have found ourselves, and that was due to a current contract with Scottish Power we had for a different building. Also, had to make an insurance claim this year due to a break in, and they still managed to only increase our premium by GBP200. Many quotes were coming back with an increase of GBP400 to GBP600 due to some kids trying their luck on finding cash on the premises. I guess we will speak in a few months when the Electricity contract is due to be renewed.
6254|I've just renewed my electricity with Make it Cheaper and thought I'd done OK. About half an hour after signing up with Scottish Power through these guys I received a phone call form British Gas offering a deal which was  significantly better - amounting to a saving of GBP400 based on my current usage.Don't be fooled by this lot - I'm now tied in to this for 3 years and as there's no cooling off period for businesses I'm truly stuffed.
6255|Make it cheaper has made it so much easier for the small chrity I manage to compare and change providers of gas, electicity, broadband and phone. It takes the time out of finding the best deals, and if any problems crop up during the process, they are on hand to help you through it or act on your behalf if needed.The staff have been very helpful and have tailored the process to my organisation, and it is always easy to contact the same member of the helpline staff for continuity.Brilliant.
6256|'Make it cheaper' could also be renamed to 'Make it easier'. It was very easy renewing contracts and they made sure they gave me all the information I needed. They told me that we should only be paying the 5% VAT rate and I've been able to retrospectively claim back money from previous energy suppliers. They have been very helpful and patient with repeating figures etc so that I can make sure I have all the information I require before making decisions.
6257|Our church has used Make It Cheaper for several years. Each time our energy bill contract is due for renewal we get a reminder and phone call so we never get automatically switched onto a high rate. The very friendly staff offer very good advice tailored to our requirements.It was explained to us about the lower VAT and CCL charges we can claim as a charity. There is no pressure to take any particular company, it is completely unbiased. All forms to end existing contract are emailed to you ready for editing and posting. Brilliant service and brilliant savings! 
6258|Make it Cheaper present competitive taroff for our gas and electricity supplies  in good time before the existing notice periods are in play.The alternative offers are clearly presented making decision making much easier to decide and to present to management with recommended course of action.Make it Cheaper follow through new suppliers to sort out any contract documentation problems. A very helpful service.
6259|Friendly helpful knowledgeable clearly communicative real human staff, find out what they need to know (without you needing to repeat your account number or be transferred or put on hold a number of times. I have a direct person, with a direct number who seemed to genuinely care about getting me the best deal - which isn't always just the cheapest!! - customer care, ease of use (ie online meter readings, and environmental preferences that are important to me and my business) where listened to and were all taken into consideration, before any decisions needed to be made. And then they made it cheaper! only negative is that it will be another 2 years before I get to use them again! Thanks MIC
6260|I urge you to use these guys who provide a great, friendly and professional service as well as taking the hassle out of switching suppliers. They saved our company 40% on our last electricity contract (compared to the previous 2 years) and we now use them for our telephone contracts too. 
6261|... And you won't have to spend any more time sourcing. Very helpful humans are on the phones that speak English with clarity (pretty basic, I know but how many unintelligible call centre operatives have you had call you?). I found MIC on the web and they set up my first electricity supply and then found me a good deal at renewal when the first supplier wanted to hike the prices. I will be using their services again in the future and totally recommend them to all.
6262|I have used makeitcheaper for many years but also use other avenues to search out the best deal for commercial energy supplies.    Make It Cheaper have never failed to provide the best comparison since I have been using them and I intend to contact them at each renewal for their latest rates.   Personally I've found it much more accurate if you tally up your KWH usage before you call and then they can really give you an accurate comparison.   I have mentioned that it might be good to explain the energy 'rollover' contracts that can catch people out as I don't believe some people are aware. Very good service and would use again.
6263|We used MIC last year when our business was really struggling. Since then, we rebranded and the business has gone from strength the strength. MIC saved us GBP34 per quarter on our phone bills, an average of GBP100 on gas bills and around GBP30 on our monthly electricy bills. This gave us an anual saving of GBP1696. Dealing with MIC was also very straight forward and simple. Changes from one supplier to another was seemless. I dont normally write reviews or give reccomendatons, however I was so impressed with this company that I forwarded their contact details to family memebers who are also busienss owners. 
6264|Received a very helpful reminder phone call from Make it Cheaper. Spoke to  helpful staff who went through the various options and then helped me to make a final choice. They sent me an email with a template termination letter for me to print onto my own letterhead, all I had to do was sign and send the letter to my energy supplier. Easy! 
6265|Make It Cheaper offer me an invaluable service, not only acting as a reminder that my energy contract (or any other contract for that matter) is due for renewal, but thay also somehow manage to find a way to beat the prices of the energy companies themselves! I am impressed with their standard or work, speed of response, and no pressure approach. Would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to renew any of their utility contracts.
6266|Have used Make It Cheaper for a couple of years now and would highly recommend them. As a joint business owner of a busy small business time is always extremely limited, I don't have time to spend hours trawling comparison websites, but they do it all for you! They contact you within the window of expiry of your current contract (which is another good feature as I would probably forget!) and give you the best options, which have always saved us money. Then there is no hassle with loads of paperwork, everything is done as simply as possible. No complaints at all!
6267|Make it cheaper made it easy to switch. They were very professional, do all the hard work while you just reap the rewards.
6268|I have been using Make It Cheaper for quite a few years now to achieve the cheapest energy costs for the two charities I'm treasurer for. They are easy to use - as they do all the work!I also like the way they contact me before contracts are due for renewal.i find the staff very pleasant and friendly, but also extremely professional, explaining everything in terms that are easy to understand.If I was a business person, I would definitely use them for phone, broadband and insurance too.
6269|I can now forget about my business electricity supply. No more worrying about termination dates and cheapest tarriffs. I am contacted each year when the review window opens with plenty of time to decide and complete any necessary paperwork. Instead of having to trawl and decipher information from all the suppliers, I now just get one phone call that sorts my renewal. If I opt to change suppliers all termination letters are emailed to me for signing. The service provided is helpful, friendly and not intrusive. I am always given direct contact details for the person handling my case. I don't feel preesured into making decisions on the spot or staying with Make it Cheaper if I don't want to.
6270|The company were friendly and efficient.  There was no pushy sales call and they listened to what I had to say.  Their deal on renewal was better than I could get and I did look around.The process was fast to complete with all the relevant paperwork sent through via email.  Other companies have required us to scan in signatures and send a lot of other information so it was nice to have a quick and easy process to follow.I think the phone call took about 10 minutes which didn't eat into my working day.  I would definitely recommend then and use them in future.
6271|Process was very clearly explained at every stage, advisor was very personable with a demeanour that was informal enough to form a rapport but formal enough to remain professional and maintain confidence in him.The tariff we were advised to take was considerably cheaper than our existing one, and will save us a considerable amount of money by the time it become active for the winter.Sending an email with approved wording for cancelling existing contracts was a nice touch, and being able to fill in, sign and print a contract online was far more preferable than waiting for contracts coming in the post.My only criticism was that I was not told there was no cooling off period for this tariff; however, I've come to believe that this seems to be the case presented with business energy. It was fine as the prices were so much cheaper we'd have been silly not to go for it, but that is something that is quite crucial when making a decision on services without time for thorough consideration.That said, I thoroughly recommend the service!
6272|Full summary of all the quotes saved me valuable time when fixing a new contract.  Very helpful personnel too.
6273|They efficiently find a competitive electricity deal for us each year, and setup the new contract in a straightforward manner.
6274|When I get a call from Make It Cheaper, I can trust them to be doing the best for me and the community centre I run.  They're not pushy, and if it's inconvenient, I can arrange a time and date to go through the details that suits me.  They've always made switching easy, and they look after our interests.
6275|Initially when setting up business I found everyone I spoke to really helpful, genuine and informative, I saved money from the start and some of the deals I got I'm still really happy with! Towards the end of this year I've had a few contacts with make it cheaper again, not the same people as before but other members of staff and have felt like they were just like every other call centre that constantly rings me up regarding energy prices etc. I was offered a ridiculous increase with my current supplier of electricity with make it cheaper, double what I'd been paying the previous year, when I confronted the person with this they managed to find a cheaper alternative despite saying initially that the same company was the cheapest they could find. On the other hand I did have a very helpful gentleman call me regarding merchant services and he was a lot more helpful and even looked up some legal issues I had with regards to the credit consumer act. 
6276|Very straightforward, with no complicated sales spiel. They simply took my electricity cost and found me a cheaper supplier, then done everything to make the switch, taking all the hard work away from me. When the time came for me to give notice to switch again, they got in touch in plenty of time to discuss my options.There was no pressure on me to take the product they found for me, and on one occasion I was unable to switch my telephone line due to the stipulations of my contract, but was able to get my phone company to match the deal found by Make It Cheaper. The agent I dealt with at MIC put no pressure on me at all, even when he found out he wouldn't be getting the business.I would highly recommend using them to help keep your costs down, and to 'make it cheaper' on all your business costs. Simple, straightforward andhighly effective way of reducing and monitoring your business costs going forward.
6277|Look, its their business to get it right and by doing so they ensure their continued success. They monitor the dates and keep our business on track with the best deals in the market. This way we can concentrate on what we do and keep our business profitable.My advice, leave it to these guys, they are the best in this sector.
6278|We tried Make It Cheaper for our business energy and have been pleased with the service. We were offered a good deal and having renewed for a second year we found the service clear and easy.Once we agreed a contract, signing an e-doc online was much easier than the verbal contract offered - and the renewal was done quickly.I'd recommend the service to anyone for anyone who want to drive the cost of their bills down - and do it with the minimum of fuss!
6279|"After spending time calling around the big 6 energy suppliers I thought I had identified the best deal with British Gas. On a whim I called make it cheaper to sense check the price I'd been given. Their adviser was able to track down a cheaper price within minutes and was able to beat the ""best"" price that the same supplier had quoted direct.  I can't praise enough the quick and courteous service that I received. On a different supply when they weren't able to match a price quoted their adviser was open and honest with me which inspired confidence in his impartiality. No hard sell was necessary and the fact that they offered a better price than going direct sealed the deal."
6280|"""Having almost been rolled over in to a much more expensive contract for our gas supply it is great to be on board with Make It Cheaper and have them monitor our renewal dates, do the comparisons and inform us of the best options available to us for our heat and light and communications supplies and take care of arranging new contracts.  It takes all the hassle out of this and leaves us free to devote the time we might have spent on it to billable work."""
6281|The conversation just seemed to flow from easy choice to easy choice. This was a great experience from a friendly member of staff who made the new contract easy. If only I had found your service earlier I could have saved myself years of hassle.
6282|When first contacted by the call centre I was dubious as to was this a scam. The advisers were brilliant answering all my questions with regard to the legitimacy of the company. Once I understood the whole process was broken down into easy steps and fully explained I cannot say how happy we are with the service it is priceless. The call centre you use to initiate the call made me feel it was some kind of scam. There was not enough of the information about who and what the company is and how it works in the initial call. I would prefer it to be an adviser than a call centre person making the first contact or at the least a better explanation initially as I nearly said I wasn't interested and put the phone down and now I realise what a big mistake that could have been
6283|I just love this company.  The idea that they phone you before your contracts expire so that they can have the time to look for the best deal is just brilliant - no more wondering how much you'll be locked into because you forgot the deadline.  The people on the end of the phone too as very helpful, and, if you do have a problem with he new company you're switcing too they are there to sort it out. Everyone should sign up you'll save money, have peace of mind over renewing, and the know;edge that Make it Cheaper are doing just that!  
6284|An excellent, one shop stop for all your business energy needs which truly delivers superior customer service with remarkable savings!

6285|Hi James  I write to say thank you for the help, assistance and advice I received from one of your staff when I contacted your company to switch suppliers.  I had dealings with Roger Burgess and at all times he was professional, courteous, polite (which British Gas weren't), helpful (not British Gas) and answered all my queries and concerns (not BG) and actually rang back when he said he would (again not BG).  In the end I did not switch supplier but the service I got from Roger was what I wish all 'customer care' should be.  I feel you should know what a good representative for your company he is.  yours  Nick Dupli-k8
6286|I found the person I contacted - Roger Burgess - to be very clear and competent. He explained what could be done about our gas supply, and what, after we had discussed it, he would do. He communicated when he said he would (a rare pleasure these days) and clearly knew his job. He remained cheerful and helpful even though he could see that the way things were going Makeitcheaper was not getting to win any business. The block of flats I was representing did however benfit to the tune of a 25% reduction in its next 12 months gas bill (compared to the current supplier's renewal offer). I have asked Roger to be sure to contact us again at our next renewal time, and shall now look at our electricity cost position. Thank you. Stephen Twilley
6287|Dear Roger Burgess  Thanks for your help in changing my electricity supplier.  I was really impressed by your professionalism and the speed with which my enquiry was dealt. I will definitely be contacting you in the future when other contracts come up for renewal.  Sue Sheardown
6288|"Dear Roger Burgess Energy Consultant  Thanks for your help and advice, it was excellent.  I initially contacted makeitcheaper.com to compare electric prices due to a dispute that I had with British Gas Business over their "" Out of Contract Charges ""  Roger contacted me and was actually able to source a substantially cheaper supplier. I did however eventually negotiate a deal with British gas that will in the short term be cheaper. I will however be contacting makeitcheaper.com as soon as my current contract with Britisg Gas expires and am confident they will be able to source me a better long term solution.  Thanks again Roger and I'm sure we will speak again in August 2010.  Best Regards.  Geoff Abel "
6289|Dear Roger Burgess... I would like to thank you for your help and advice, a very friendly and real customer service professional ! I would not hesitate to recommend you to any one that wants to switch suppliers and will put a notice in my shop window to inform others. wishing you all the best, A.Baxter- Articulation, Faversham
6290|"Dear Ruku,  I would like to thank you for your excellent advice and help in finding a better rate for Skipsea Methodist Church's electricity.  As you suggested, I approached several suppliers direct and despite our very low consumption, British Gas offered us a standing charge of 41.86p per day and a unit rate of 11.48p, which is lower than our current supplier, npower. However, they also generously gave us GBP100 credit and a one-year contract, which means that our standing charge for the next year will be only GBP52, and have classed us as a ""micro business.""  I am very pleased with this and could not have done it without your help. You were patient, courteous and good-humoured and I hope that you will pass these comments along to your superiors. "
6291|I was moving house and contacted British Gas to advise them that the final payment of the account would need to wait one and a half months after our departure due to the cost of the moving.  This was agreed using the telephone.  I then cancelled the DD as I had moved 3 months previously where I still retained the DD link and British Gas took nearly GBP800 from my account because they believed that was how much I owed.  I subsequently proved that this was erroneous and eventually I received the refund and a poor apology.  You can understand my reason for cancelling the DD link.  However, immediately the link was severed British Gas had debt collectors chasing me.  This was annoying but as I knew I had made an agreement I was not too concerned.  In view of British Gas's attitude I delayed payment to them for another 2 months.  Prior to me paying I received no apologies and they were insistent upon continuing with the debt collectors.  Hence my actions.  I would never use British Gas again.  Another problem was I gave them a telephone number just so that an engineer could pay a visit and they said that they would not retain the number this was only for this one purpose. Naturally they gave this number to the debt collectors.  Illegal! Even the CEO was very unhelpful.
6292|They tried to increase our direct debit from 150 to 450 a month.I called them to find out why and they gave me the standard... we read your meter and it was higher then previous estimates.Ok you cant argue with that, or can you?As we take both gas and elec from them, I asked them for the readings 12 months ago and then I read the meters today. I calculated given the pence per kwh for all the readings and worked out that we should pay about 130 a month, not 450 a month.They keep trotting out this real vs estimate sentence. Anyhow I then compared todays readings with the ones they took 3 weeks ago. They do not put these on the bill anymore. It turned out their reader had made an error inputted the wrong reading, so the bill for elec was 700 not 2000 as they had calculated.So if I was an old person, I would have just said ok, you read the meter, you must be right, I will find another 300 pounds a month. Unluckily for them I am not that old, have a science degree and am no stranger to electricity or KWH.To be fair the poor guy on the phone did his best and was nothing but polite, as was I.So be careful if you get any stupid bills and just question them in detail until its sorted.
6293|I purchased dual fuel from British Gas.  Honestly, with the competitive prices offered by other energy companies and the more active role government is playing in monitoring fuel prices, the main thing I look for now is customer service. Problem 1: When my prepayment meter also British Gas in a new property was changed to monthly meter there was an extra GBP5 left in the prepaid card which British Gas failed to reimburse despite making repeated promises.  In the end as each call took so long, my boyfriend said forget it.  Imagine them owing GBP5/customer of 1million customers.  Hmm easy profits eh?Problem 2: Calling British Gas on their 0800 number takes on average 45 to 60 minutes.  And then you would have to talk to someone new repeat everything and chances are nothing resolved.**Tip for mobile phone users, use British Gas's overseas number so you are not charged a premium which they profit from, and put the call on speaker phone while kept on hold so you can actually get on with your life.**Since my boyfriend has relinquished overseeing the utilities to me, the first thing I did was give British Gas the sack.  My new supplier answers my phonecall under 5 minutes, does not sound tired like the droids at British Gas and very clearly offers an 0800 number for landlines and 0330 number for mobile users on their website.
6294|I lived in a STUDIO flat for 9 months, the last 3 months of my tenancy i had to pay for my bills.  The 1st month Feb 2014, my bill was GBP90, and i thought that was high.  Which made me re-think my energy usage: switching off all plugs, the hot water when not needed and not even putting on my electric heaters as i had in the past.  My final bill is GBP561 for just 2 MONTHS, in a STUDIO property.  How has my bill increased that much?  That is GBP381 more than i had expected, which is MORE than 3 times the expected amount. I had even hoped for a lesser bill due to being more efficient with my usage.Time to look into some court action. DAYLIGHT ROBBERY!!!!
6295|I switched electricity/ gas supplier some years ago. I received paper bill from British Gas which was GBP500-00+ in credit! the final bill from British Gas I received debited the GBP500+ leaving me with zero. Never did get it back.
6296|this is the worst customer service and most expensive company ever. I use to be with british gas on energy supplier, at first the first 12 months bill look ok and normal but still very expensive, after that 12 months the british gas send me a letter and saying there have been under estimate me and telling me to extra GBP7,000, this was crazy I phone them up, the british gas people keep on passing me to another department and another department and constanly talk to difference person to person at the end I got to talk to the final person and he said to me, yes everything is accurate I own them GBP7,000. I was thinking why after 1 years send me a bill GBP7,000 just 2 words said under estimate and there have scam you, my English is not too good or well spoken so don't know what to do the weird thing they have stop sending me statement to track my usage, there just send me a total invoice every month how much I use and added on the top of the GBP7,000, I phone them up again asking them why don't I get statement, there keep saying we have send them out to me and is been 6 months not receive statement only keep sending a invoice that only said the sub total I own them now, cause I don't have the money to pay the one off GBP7,000 I only can paid little bit at a month and plus on top how much I use that month. I was so tied down with british gas for 2 years contract can't wait to leave this company but I still need to pay them off before there will let you switch to another energy supplier. one day I received a letter is another invoice saying I am GBP9,000 in credit, this is so weird I call them up same thing again keep on passing me to person to person to speak to me and I told them about this invoice and that person said to me o is a mistake is not right you are not in credit you still own british gas a out standing balance, so I said ok so I leave it and hang up and after couple month same thing happening again sending me a separate invoice saying i'm in credit of GBP9,000 but there still sending me invoice every months saying how much I own then. now I have pass this case to a advisory to help me out on this. 
6297|I decided to leave British gas as price went up before Christmas November 2012 time and again in march 2013 ... I've had hardest time ever switching and they said my final gas bill was GBP203 but they need to refund me GBP60 from my electric bill as we had duel fuel ... I had explained that bothe were on same account and why can't they send me a giro of GBP143 instead of refunding me 60 and still me paying GBP203 saves time and easier for me to pay off.. I spoke to 3 customer service guys who all said they owed me GBP60 and the last call I made to them I had the guy tell me over the phone they owe me GBP60 I got him to calculate it and tell me the difference as I was flustered ( my 3and4yr old are not best pleased if I'm on the phone and they keep u online for ages about 50mins a call) today I received the bill of GBP203 I've rang and told the lady I don't owe all that and she said the last call had been logged explaining I would have a final bill of that amount... What? The guy told me and calculated the difference I'm fuming!! I've tol her to contact the manager and the phone call I had needs to be listened to as he was not the only who told me they owed me GBP60 ...3 diffetent guys had , their communication and customer service is not good at all I feel stressed from this and fed up with it now am waiting a call bk from them although doubt they will refund me anything! I've only switched once before and had no problems! British gas make it hard for u to leave and will try to clamp u down and make u stay but be warned if u fee leave them they will try to squeeze money out of you!! Even at htostmas I was GBP150 in credit on both accounts yet struggled to get a refund in always gave readings and all way been in credit after Christmas and ask for it bk but leave GBP50 on each to keep me safe and use the money I was owed towards my boys birthdays which is end dec and beginning f January... At the end of the day if u pay to much u shoul get it no bit that was hard I had to convince them I'm a good custome and I need bk what uv paid over although kept some on each account!! Painfull company!!!!!! Wish me luck and I started my switch 2monts ago and it's still ongoing!!! 
6298|"From Nov 12 to date (April 13) I have had to ring numerous times re my direct debit payments. Initially I just wanted a refund as I was overpaying on my gas bill ( I have duel fuel with them). Constantly had to keep ringing as never done and each person I spoke with said they have the notes but ""for some reason"" the job was not processed, but they will sort it ""today"". It was not sorted for 4 months by 6 different staff,  so I cancelled my DD's and paid each month on line. I eventually reset up DD's at a lesser amount in March 2012, (GBP205pm for both)and today, on my bank statement, they have taken the old amount of GBP270 for both. I give up. Absolutely useless. Do not use. I did put in a complaint, which they advised I do, but have heard nothing. What a bunch of idiots. "
6299|It's not a difficult task. Supply electric, collect payment, one would think it would be ABC. After 6 months they still can't spell my name properly. Lie about readings they have taken and the prices are ridiculous. Good bye BG, hello EDF. Just as useless I'm sure but a least it's cheaper!
6300|After contacting BG because my monthly bills where excessiveI was told that we where paying too much. I was offered GBP450 as a refund althoughHad to ring back on a week day to allow the computer to submit a refund.When I rang them back on the Monday, I was informed that it was aMistake and that I actually owed them GBP148. Totally disappointed as they could only offer me GBP70 compensation If I stayed with them for 9 months! I am currently waiting for a reply after refusing the offer. 
6301|I have been with British Gas for 3 years by Direct Debit. Last time I looked at my account I was GBP260 in credit. I asked for it back and have been given 4 different excuses as to why it's going to take longer than the stated 5 days, up to 25 days . In the end I had to switch to another supplier, I still haven't received my credit! Do not use British gas!
6302|Avoid British Gas at all costs! For a simple electricity contract I have had constant time consuming hassles from them. For example they have given highly over-estimated bills despite having taken readings which they then ignored, have failed to turn up for appointments for meter readings, and have been unapologetic and unconcerned where they have repeatedly failed to meet reasonable standards of service. I will never do business with British Gas or one of their associated companies again. Do yourself a favour and use an alternative.  
6303|"i was having problems paying a large sum of money each month and very idiotically asked to be switched to pre pay meter. big mistake they switched my payment method by their computers so i physically could not make a payment and took two months putting a meter in resulting in a large outstanding debt. they then told me this will be taken off the meter GBP6 pw till all paid off -20 quid good will as it was their mistake, problem solved i imagined. wrong again i called up to see when the debt was paid as gas was costing 15 pw in summer? advised the debt was not put on the meter. then advised was doing it now and advised amount including the 20 which i should of had taken off. very unhappy now. gas price again seemed to go up paying around 20pw tried to change and refused due to outstanding on meter. called again and was told ""it has dropped off the meter"" again applied another 6 months in middle of winter and paying 40 pw for gas changed over suppliers to receive a letter saying outstanding i then called and was told it had dropped off again. but it hadnt because i had been checking the charge i told the girl to put me onto a manager she replied oh no your right it is just 20 that had not been put on the meter. i am sure i had been charged twice for the debt but no way of proving it. **************************avoid this company****************************"
6304|I am a business user and BG suckered me in to a contract,saying i would pay 10.5p per unit and no standing charge. 12 months later,they increased my rate to 14.5p per unit and said that they had rolled me into another contract as i  hadn't replied to their end of contract notification letter!WHAT LETTER!!!!!!They said i had to wait 2 years to get out of it.I have still got 7 months left on my contract,and received a bill this morning,showing my quarterly bill has gone from approx GBP250 to GBP380,they say i now have to pay a standing charge of 45p per day as i didnt reply to their letter once again!! If this  review stops just one more person being ripped off by BG it will have been worth it.STAY AWAY!!!!!!
6305|my deal came to end at eon and british gas caught me in january 2011 ,they did not send out contract or prices ,so in mid feb i e-mailed them to put transfer on hold ,british gas ignored this .So at the beginging of march i complained and was told tough transfer has taken place ,and it will take us 6 weeks to sort out.Avoid like the plague worst customer service ever
6306|as a business user beware if you do not renew your contract they roll it over and charge you 50 percent above there normal rates and there atitude stinks and they tie u in for 12 months more they are as bad as the worst loan sharks if loan sharks did this they would be stopped i would like to approach a member of parliament about this it is abuse of power have u had this problem? www.dappaboutique.com please contact paul
6307|Never, never, never use BG. Look at their adverts, all smiley, cartoon simple, happy world... wait, and it won't be if you have a problem, you will have problems. The worst company I have ever had to deal with. Don't be taken in, an absolute pit of vipers
6308|Dont change over- they are the worst company ever- total rip offs!!!
6309|I moved away from British Gas after just some months, I just had enough!! Bills are difficult to read, lots of small tricky print. You pay something like 15 pounds electricity and on top of it almost double this money as a charge, about GBP 27, why should I?? After 2 weeks late paying the bill, another GBP 40 added on top for being late. People at customer services are really arrogant, the feeling is that they are right in any case, in any way, and they just don't care of you. They are just after your money, and they find any possible way of getting it and you don't ever know what you are paying for. I am switching back to EDF energy, ohhh, that was a nightmare.
6310|British Gas - worst company in the world. I have received estimated bills for the last 2 years, beliving them initially I paid it like a fool. (I had only just moved from home - never had to deal with this before). The statements came saying I owed them money. They pestered me for a year and a half with red letters threatening to take me to court and cut me off and phone calls, then when transco came to check my meter he said they had been charging me for someone elses meter. My account was updated with all the payments I had made and I was over GBP200 in credit. My credit rating has flopped because of this and they still send me estimated bills and I think when you send them a meter reading they just add it to the estimate meaning you owe even more! I'm switching it off and waiting for my next estimate now. their customer service is awful too, even if you can speak to someone who speaks english! Dont choose British Gas whatever you do - you might aswell give them your bank card and pin number.
6311|just recieved my quaterly gas bill a bit shocking at 33o pounds so i decided to take a look at it  bearing in mind that british gas has just put up there prices  the bill was split up into 4 months  sep oct nov and dec <20 days> the last meter reading which is outside on the side of the house was dec 31 2010 the previous one was sep 22 2010  37 days was the time for septembers estimated usage just 64 units  although the 20 days in december my estimated usage was97 units no coincidence that prices had gone up in december and was dearer so they dcecided to put my usage up by 300% i know its been cold but not to that extent i rang them and of course there is nothing they can do as it was done on last years usage when 4 people lived here  and my ex was in all day now i live alone at work all day or night and was in gran canaria for two weeks out of the 20 days !!!!!! surely this cant be right  anyone know what or who i can contact to get my bill estimated more fairly ?? it makes you wonder how much british gas has made by this ever so sneaky little con  
6312|"British Gas are probably the world's worst energy supplier.  Their customer service staff are poorly trained and downright rude.  They have managed to totally mess up my online electricity account twice in six months.    The first time their computer system didn't give me a bill for 6 months (I only received one after I phoned to ask why I hadn't had one) and then when I received the bill I was told I had to pay the GBP500+ bill straight away as it was overdue!    The second time was a mistake with my final bill (I have changed suppliers to EDF, as they are much cheaper), once again the meter reading wasn't transfered to billing and the first I knew of the outstanding balance was from a very snotty phone call from their debt collecting department!  Once again they wanted payment straight away as the bill was overdue.  The lady said that it was impossible for me to have not received a bill and that I must have been looking at the wrong online account!!??  I asked to speak to her supervisor (still waiting one & a half hours later) as she just didn't seem to understand that it had happened to me before, or want to accept that their computer system isn't perfect.   I got very angry at this point and called their complaints department.  I must say that the lady I spoke to there was very helpful and told me I wasn't going mad and that the meter readings & bills do sometimes get ""lost"" and then reappear (bizarre!).   To conclude - avoid like the plague!"
6313|recieved an electricity bill 24/12/2010 for wait for it GBP11347.00 bearing in mind on a pre paid meter for 20 years and also paid GBP3000 off a debt apparently owed even though i have always been on pre payment meter, have a 3 bed house 1 oil filled radiator as too scared to put anything on GBP150 a week on pre pay, a son who has cancer who can no longer stay with me as house to cold, and could kill him, had no joy from scottish gas , loads of excuses and seriously skint due to charges usless robbers who do not bother, if anyone could please help me contact emma.brannagan@btinternet.com   ratings - 10000000000000
6314|Very, very poor customer service. Staff are poorly trained and not really that interested in providing a good service! I spent an hour on the phone and then got hung up on, and had to call back with my query, which started from scratch!Stay away if possible - they're not even the cheapest so I can't see what might be even remotely attractive about them...!
6315|They put a new meter in 1 year ago. They sent a man round every time to read the meter and bill me accordingly.  1 year later they debit from my account without notification in letter or phone form, the sum of GBP1400.  When I asked them, they said they made a billing error and we under charged you in the whole year so they are entitled to take my money.  I asked for a refund and to take the payments equally over the next few months...they would not, could not ....What ever....  I had to go to the bank and get a direct debit indemnity form filled out to get my money back.  Brithish gas are not following trading guidlines or value their customers.   I will be changing gas and electricity supplier asap. 
6316|"British Gas' customer service is truly appalling. Having moved out of a rented property where British Gas was the supplier, I had to request a receipted final bill in order to get my deposit money back. When I rang to submit a final meter reading and request this bill, they gave me the WRONG AMOUNT to pay. I patiently waited for the copy of the bill saying I had paid all the monies due, in order to forward it to my landlord, but instead received a bill for several pennies! I rang to complain and demand the final bill to be sent to me immediately, making it particularly clear that I was waiting on the document for an important reason. I was assured that, yes, it would be coming, and the few pennies they forgot to charge me for the first time would be written off. Yet, ten days later, nothing had arrived from them. This time, I thought I would try to tackle the problem via their online message service. I got yet another reassurance that ""a bill will be with you within two weeks"". Provided it arrives in that time (I'm still waiting), it will be two months that British Gas has been stringing me along! I was thinking about switching both gas and electricity in my new property to British Gas, as I thought they had a good online system, but this just shows that they cannot be relied upon. EDF got me my final bill within 4 days of request, but somehow it takes British Gas two months?! "
6317|I live in a small 1 bedroom flat which is heated by district heating.  The only electic I use is for small electrical items.  I do not have gas.  British Gas thought I was running an industry when they posted me an online bill for September of this year for the grand sum of GBP901 25 for a quarter.  I gave the September reading which was correct.  The previous reading for June was read by a meter reader and he got the first digit of the meter wrong, he put a 6 instead of a 7.  When I gave a reading in September it was put at over 10,000 klwatts of electic I had used. My proper bill was GBP39.50.An ammended bill was sent for GBP25 then another bill arrived for GBP39.50,then 3 privious bills.My first bill with British Gas in January this year was GBP188 - for 1 month.  This was an estimate and the bill was only GBP24.British Gas have messed my account up since I joined in December 2008. Thay have apologised over the phone after I have phoned complaints, but I have had no written apology for all the mistakes they made.  They are trying to keep me by sending out 2+4+1 vouchers for days out and said if I stay with them for 6 months, they will send me GBP150 off an holiday.  A rubbish company who have to btibe customers to stay with them instead of getting rid of their incompetent staff and cleaning up their act.  I am changing supplier as soon as possible.  Good riddance British Gas.
6318|Never ever sign up to British Gas for anything. I had a run in with them a while ago and am still fuming about it! The short version is that they replaced an electricity meter in my house for some reason (1 year after doing the same!) and failed to update their records - resulting in my bills only ever being estimates as the readings I and meter reading companies supplied wouldn't tally up with the expected readings. After a while I got fed up of this so I switched suppliers to Atlantic (who are excellent btw!) and requested a final bill from BG. Despite my giving them the correct meter number numerous times this situation eventually culminated in them threatening to take me to court for non-payment of a final bill that was never actually sent to me! Several months later, consisting of angry telephone calls, letters, reports to EnergyWatch (who weren't much use either) the situation was allegedly resolved by BG, and I was given a grand total of GBP15 compensation that they knocked off the final bill. Whoopie doo. Looking back, I should have let them go to the expense of taking me to court! AND they still couldn't manage to forward the correct meter number onto Atlantic when I switched to them - Atlantic managed to sort the problem out from their end after one telephone call. Well done Atlantic. My advice - NEVER EVER get involved with British Gas!
6319|I must say that British Gas is the most expensive company ever. Compared to British gas, UW is much more better! Saving more money,getting Discount cLUB!!!!uTILITY IS THE BEST SAVING COMPANY ELEC, GAS, INTERNET BROADBAND EVER!!!! MUST HAVE A GO!!!we are not looking for quality becuase they are all the same.... but we are looking for saving money!!!! yeah!!!!go for it!!!Utility Warehouse!!!!
6320|I must say that British Gas are the most incompetent bunch of people!  They took a few eternities to change an electric meter (their property) when we reported it broken and then tried to estimate our bill. This was eventually resolved but they now maintain that we are using far more electricity we were with EDF. Their customer service is non existent! I would go to an energy watchdog but they appear completely spineless when dealing with complaints about shoddy, third rate service. The moral of this story? Steer clear of British Gas if you don't want stress induced chest pains! 
6321|We've been paying for full homecare cover on the boiler since we moved in to our property in Decemeber 08.  We got this as BG wrote to us saying that the previous owners were covered and did we want to continue.   They finally came out for first visit last week and said the boiler is obsolete so can't cover it so were reducing our level of cover but if we wanted to cancel it would cost GBP80.  I pointed out that they knew what boiler we had as they covered the last peopls so shouldn't have offered us cover and taken our money the customer care rep said that they were running a business and what did I expect and that I wasn't listening to him - never spoken to such a rude person.  We're now replacing our boiler and central heating, needless to say we won't be using BG.
6322|British Gas customer service really fell below what i would expect.Waiting for 30 minutes on hold and then disconnecting me?
6323|I have been in dispute with british gas over there wrong billing. To date I have resolved nothing whatsoever, this is now 3 months on. Got a call from them tonight saying that they are unable to sort it out so could I get in touch with energy watch this way it will get resolved! Luckily I am able to make light of my situation and have a laugh about it, but would not recommend British Gas.
6324|It seems that electricity is a very poor second cousin to gas!!  There are no clear contact numbers on the website and I have spent over one and half hours trying to make contact with the correct department for repairs to the meter - which is their property.  I still haven't made contact, and who knows how long it will take to get an engineer to call.  I am going to go with a dedicated electricity company as soon as this problem is resolved.
6325|We changed from MEB in 2000 to British Gas, and with MEB who we were with for years always in credit. We only changed because of a promise from a sales employee of British Gas, promising us a 33% discount off our MEB bill, which we told her that it was set at around forty pounds per month. We expected after the change an immediate saving, but we were certainly in for a big shock! Even before the ink was dry on the contract they turned around a said that the reading that had been taken by their engineerand was higher than the figure set by the MEB, and they therefore required us to a direct debit for sixty six pounds, there was no mention of our promised 33% discount.We felt forced to increase the amount to the required sum, but as soon as we did this they then sent  us a bill of almost six hundred pounds stating that this amount was owed from the change over from the MEB. I was lived and followed it up with BRitish Gas directors in Edinburgh, but after month of research they still could not come a reason what the amount represented.The other problem is that we are renting the property from a private landlord, and we are responsible for the running of a 24hr sewage pump serving four other cottages and British Gas refuse to give us a breakdown of charges because everything has always been on one meter. If the did do as we say we could then claim compensation from our landlord.Even with the running of the pump our bill from MEB was alwaysno more than forty pounds per month, so we paid the bill forthe first two years and then disputed the amounts because they insisted on a direct debit for one hundred pounds.As of today the bill stands at eight thousand, four hunded pounds and they are threatening cut us off, but thiscould have been sorted years ago when we offered a direct debit for one hundred pounds per month only to be turned down, as they wanted around three hundred?
6326|I went with British Gas for electricity, they mucked up my transfer and blamed the other company. It took British Gas six months to sort out my bill after constantly e-mailing them as I got fed up phoning them and being misinformed on more than one occasion when I called about why my account was not up to date. I eventually 'binned' them. A complete waste of my time and expense on phone calls
6327|I would go as far as to say British Gas have provided me with the WORST customer service I have ever encountered. I simply cannot recommend them to anyone and hence my advice is not to go with British Gas.
6328|From the recent news coverage British Gas appear to be a greedy company who do not seem to look after their customers. I also found they are more expensive than other companies which offer a better service than them.  This latest price increase disgusts me - after the massive profits they made!  My advice to others: Go with one of the cheaper companies that look after their customers better and offer better service. You will find a company offering better service on one of the energy watch sites. They need us and if enough of us move from them - they will get the message.  It will only take a couple of months before they feel the pinch - I urge others to do this!
6329|I am currently waiting to switch to Scottish Power where I have my gas since I was misinformed when moving to British Gas, I have also had a lot of problems with bills etc constantly sending estimates even though I have supplied meter readings.
6330|I would not bother with British Gas unless you want to waste lots of time like I had to, trying to contact them and monitoring your bills to check that you are still on a tariff that offers good value.
6331|British Gas are a total nightmare the Electric is costing us GBPGBP10 a day which it was never like this before. Not only this when we switched over British Gas said when you get the key you will already have GBP20 on it already so we phoned up there terrible service only for a women to say sorry you only get that when you have been with us for a year so they did nothing. Oh customer service all they said was we will tell the person off for saying that to you so there was no money put on that key for us so the problem is why lie. Simple to get more customers do not switch to these the company is terrible overpriced with staff who do not really care about there customers.
6332|I was informed when moved electricity to themselves because my gas was already with them I would receive a GBP20-00 bonus for switching, upon receiving bill and the bonus not credited when called I was informed it would be added on my fourth quarterly bill, thus meaning waiting a year for my bonus, I was certainly not informed of this when signing up. I may move on from this Company due to their lack of information re the above.
6333|I had a problem with British Gas when i first moved home, I felt my bill was too high yet no1 at British Gas was helpful
6334|This is a long story which I will attempt to shorten. We received a surprise electricity bill for GBP1500 following having a meter change which we were horrified by. British Gas claimed that estimates were wrong despite me giving them meter readings. This was for a 12 month period. Living with my wife in a mid terrace with an empty house most of the day I was convinced this was wrong. In summary it took us months to fight this bill and get a simple and accurate breakdown of how my bill was calculated and what I owed! I handed all my bills to my accountant who forwarded all correspondence to Energy Watch. After several months of not paying anything and being very hard nosed, insisting that we wanted a breakdown of the situation on paper before paying,  we finally received a simple spreadsheet detailing what we had spent. It came to GBP300! There is a big difference between GBP1500 and GBP300 - and only after receiving several threatening letters and being told we were about to have debt collectors, court summons, electricity cutoff etc. As you can imagine, it is difficult not to feel intimidated and stressed about this. But they had got it wrong, and it took us over six months to get them to admit it. I bet thousands of customers have actually agreed to pay off rather than going through the hassle of finding out the truth. There is something very wrong and I bet British Gas are making money. I have only just found that my next door neighbour had exactly the same scenario, but instead she elected to pay the amount.
6335|Administratively they have been appalling. If I costed my time and lost interest on the credit balance they have built up, they would be the dearest in the market. some of the problems I have had -Ignore e-mailsDifficult to contact by phoneDo not return calls when promisedLet credit balance build up but ignore requests to refund it and refuse to pay interest or compensate
6336|I changed from a prepay to a regular meter several months after moving in.  They tried to charge me for several months of electricity for the time I had the prepay meter.  Luckily I had noted dates in my diary for the time I got the meter changed.  The new consumer unit never got registered and every time I got a bill and tried to give them a correct reading, they couldn't take it because they said I needed two readings, not just one that showed on my new meter.  I had two visits from British Gas to read the meter, but that didn't work.  It took over 12 months to sort it out and many many repetitive phone calls.  I hardly have the energy to change suppliers for fear that there will be another fiasco.
6337|Always check your bill thoroughly before paying it! After spending 5 months trying to notify them I had moved in to my property,  they tried to charge me nearly GBP900 for 6 months electricity in a 1 bed flat. The meter readings on the bill did not match the charges.  They then altered 'actual' meter readings to suit the amount they wanted to charge me. Then when I contacted Energywatch (who were no more helpful) a revised bill was sent out. After three requests, I am still yet to receive this bill but have had calls from the their debt collection department, and a reminder stating I now owe them GBP100 more, and GBP14 for the letter. Every time I try to contact British Gas they have no record of any complaint, phone calls, letters or email. On top of this their customer service is appalling, they are untrustworthy and incompetent!
6338|Great service and good value for your money. Cutting prices every month. Excellent supplier.
6339|My bills have been going up & up with British Gas....I used to pay GBP25 per month for electricity. British Gas miscalculated so my monthly bill increased to GBP78 per month. A few months later I got another letter to say they have re-assessed and my monthly bill would increase to GBP93...I got a letter yesterday to say my bill will now be GBP115!!! I'm looking for a new supplier now!
6340|They constantly mess up your gas bills, and send you reminders when you have already paid. This happened to us with British Gas.
6341|EDF Energy is much cheaper!
6342|I recently had a flood and used 4 industrial dehumidifiers for 2 weeks. They used GBP300 worth of electricity. I rang customer services and paid the GBP300 over the telephone. British Gas have now re-assessed my monthly payments, and they have gone up from GBP33 per month to GBP134 per month. Customer services now refuse to re-assess my payments, taking into account the electricity used by the dehumidifiers. They refuse to allow me to speak to anyone in management. The best they can do is say that a supervisor will ring me back within 5 days, but there is no point, as once an assessment has been made it can't be redone. I have spent a fortune in phone calls trying to sort this out on 0870 numbers, but basically, British Gas couldn't care less. I have also e-mailed them, but have to date only received notification that a reply will take 7 days, by which time they will have already taken their first GBP134 from my account.
6343|"A young man knocked on my door one weekend and offered me GBP35 off my electric bill if I changed to British Gas.  I took up the offer, as it seemed to have no drawbacks at all.  About a month later a final bill arrived from my previous supplier, and a date for the connection to British Gas arrived.  I noticed that the new rates, although lower at night, were much higher during the day.  My neighbour confirmed that British Gas were the most expensive.  I phoned my old supplier and I was told there was nothing that I could do for a month, then I could change back if I wanted.  I decided I may as well sit it out for the first quarter, to see what would happen, as the GBP35 saving I was offered is possible after a one year connection.  I would give British Gas a try.Well, my first quarterly bill has arrived, and guess what?... It is the same as last year!  All the stories were just that - stories.  It was also interesting to note that a 10% reduction is to take place, which would make my next years bill 10% less than the two previous ones. It was interesting to note that my estimated usage payment of GBP45 a month was over the top for a whole year, as in the summer only, a third of the power is used by me.  Previously with EDF, the monthly payment was only GBP30.  I wrote a letter to British Gas about this situation, and I told them ""as they said they were to reduce my bills, that I certainly will not be paying more than what I had been paying previously"".  They ignored the letter, and it is noticeable on my first bill that they want me to continue to pay GBP45 a month, even though it has never been paid.Overall, the changeover has been smooth, and the offer of a 10% reduction in the future is excellent!  If the GBP35 reduction comes through at the end of my first years usage, it will have been a good move to British Gas.  So do not believe the hype that 1 million people have left the company because of it, and it seems it was all nothing but bad publicity - nothing to do with the reality."
